Adjuntas is spread over 16 barrios and Adjuntas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). Adjuntas is about two hours by car westward from the capital, San Juan .\\n\nAdjuntas is nicknamed \"the Switzerland of Puerto Rico\", because of its relatively chilly weather. Many Puerto Rican mountain towns have cooler weather than the rest of the island; Adjuntas is no exception: the average yearly weather is 70 °F (21 °C ) (High: 83 °F/28 °C; Low: 58 °F/14 °C).  Puerto Rico\\'s lowest temperature were recorded in Adjuntas at 38 °F in 2018.  Its mild climate attracts a good number of island tourists during the summer months. The town has a small hotel named Monte Rio and a good-sized parador , or country inn, called Villa Sotomayor.  \\n\nAdjuntas\\' ZIP Code, 00601, is the lowest standard ZIP code in the United States ZIP code system .\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Adjuntas literally translates to \"attached\" in Spanish. The name is most likely a shortening of \" tierras adjuntas a Coamo \" or \\'lands attached (or in proximity ) to Coamo\" as the territory was originally part of the lands of Villa de San Blas de Illescas , one of the oldest settlements in Puerto Rico , which the municipality gained autonomy from in 1739.  \\n\nThe municipality has received numerous nicknames throughout its history, such as La Ciudad del Gigante Dormido , Spanish for \"city of the sleeping giant\" after the mountain that overlooks the town ; La Suiza de Puerto Rico (\"Puerto Rico\\'s Switzerland \") due to its relative cool temperatures and mountainous terrain; and La Tierra de los Lagos (\"Land of the Lakes\") after the many natural pools or charcas that are formed by the numerous rivers that flow through the municipality.\\n\nHistory\nAlthough there are petroglyphs and traces of Taíno people in Adjuntas, there is no proof that the region was dominated by any specific cacique . Nearby caciques like Guarionex and Urayoán could have had some control over the area.\\n\nAccording to historian Aurelio Tió, during the Spanish colonization of Puerto Rico in the 16th century, it is believed that a Spanish interpreter called Juan González settled in the region. Also, historian Cayetano Coll y Toste wrote a legend about Spanish people looking for gold in the region of Adjuntas.\\n\nAs colonization progressed, Adjuntas became part of the San Blas de Illescas (Coamo village) ,  which was founded in 1579 and became the most important settlement in the south. It is believed that the name \"Adjuntas\" derives from the term of \"being close\" to Coamo. As population shifted to Ponce , Adjuntas became more linked to that town, and then to Utuado , being a barrio of this municipality in 1739.\\n\nWith 20 families established in the region, the residents of Adjuntas asked for the settlement to be officially recognized. The town of Adjuntas was then founded on August 11, 1815, with Diego Maldonado being elected as its representative. A city hall and public square were built shortly after.  \\n\nAdjuntas was one of the main cities where the Anusim , Maranos , and other Sephardi Jews settled in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nAfter the mid-19th century, Adjuntas welcomed many immigrants from the Mediterranean islands Corsica and Majorca . Some of them established coffee plantations . During the last decades of the 19th century, the coffee produced in Adjuntas was exported to Europe, United States and even the Vatican .  \\n\nAdjuntas was proclaimed a \"villa\", or a first order municipality, by the Spanish Government Monarchy in 1894.  Several years after, the town was occupied by the United States Army forces during the Spanish-American War of 1898 and was visited by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906.  \\n\nThe discovery of rich deposits of copper, gold and other minerals during the 1960s motivated some local community and environmental leaders to oppose the mining. Casa Pueblo , a local community organization settled in Adjuntas, opposed to the mining and advocates for the preservation of natural resources in Puerto Rico.    \\n\nIn 1992, Southern Gold Resources , a US company, was granted permission to explore for gold in Adjuntas and Utuado, Puerto Rico.  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides all across Adjuntas, with its winds and significant amount of rain, 18.38 inches in Adjuntas.   The hurricane winds and rain damaged infrastructure and the electrical system of Adjuntas collapsed leaving its over 18,000 residents with no electrical power. PR-10 which connects Adjuntas to Utuado collapsed by 9 feet, and according to the mayor of Adjuntas, 1500 homes were completely destroyed. Nearly 62% of the residents of Adjuntas were already living below the poverty level when Hurricane María hit Puerto Rico.  The municipality was also affected by the 2020 earthquakes which caused landslides and power outages in the region.  \\n\nEl Gigante Dormido (\"the sleeping giant\") is a mountain (Cerro El Gigante) and panoramic view that resembles the shape of a man lying on his back, the profile of his face is reflected in the mountain ridges of Adjuntas. Legend says that many years ago a sole resident lived in the region, and he was a giant. The people wanted to live in those fertile lands, but they would observe the giant stretching his arms widely over the area, even peeping his head over the mountain peaks. A witch learned that to kill the giant she would have to hit him in his right eye with a poisoned arrow, which she did one day as he stood up. Being hit in the eye, the giant leapt in pain and fell flat on his back but not before punching the ground hard and that formed an area from where water foamed up. Eventually, the giant on his back became petrified in that position forming the panorama of the profile of his face.  \\n\nGeography\nThe terrain of Adjuntas is very mountainous due to its location in the Cordillera Central . It borders Utuado in the north and east, Lares and Yauco to the west, and Guayanilla , Peñuelas , and Ponce to the south.  \\n\nHistorian Pedro Tomás de Córdova described the terrain as \"high, and mountainous, and very healthy\". He also praised the quality of the terrain for agriculture.  Adjuntas\\' highest peak is Monte Guilarte (3,773 ft; 1,150 m),  followed by Vaquiñas (3,346 ft; 1,020 m). Guilarte itself is the sixth highest peak in Puerto Rico and is located in Guilarte State Forest . Córdova also mentioned the water features, describing 26 rivers and 16 creeks that ran through the region.\\n\nThe following rivers flow through Adjuntas: Río Cidra , Río Corcho , Rio de la Ciénaga ,  Río Garzas , Río Guilarte , Río Limaní , Río Saltillo , Río Toro , Río Vacas , and Río Yahuecas . There aren\\'t any beaches in Adjuntas given that it is landlocked.  \\n\nThe municipality of Adjuntas is made up of 17 barrios , including the barrio-pueblo.     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nAdjuntas features a tropical rainforest climate that borders on a subtropical highland climate . While the town technically features a tropical rainforest climate, due to its high elevation, the climate is noticeably cooler than the norm for this climate category. Summers are warm (83°-85 °F) in the daytime and mild at nighttime (60°-63 °F).\\nMeanwhile, winters are moderately warm with cool temperatures at night. During daytime, high temperatures are around 79 °F (26 °C) in the town and 68 °F (20 °C) in the nearby mountains. Winter night temperatures are between in the 55 °F (13 °C) and 60 °F (16 °C) range, but after cold fronts temperatures can drop down to 45 °F (7 °C).  Adjuntas\\' summer climate is comparable to higher altitude locations near the equator (albeit with warmer winters), such as Medellin , while its winters are comparable to higher latitude locations at the limit of the tropics such as West Palm Beach .\\n\nDemographics\nIn 2020, Adjuntas had a population of 18,020.   \\n\n80% of the per capita income of Adjuntas is a product of agriculture. In 2010, unemployment hit 20.2%. According to mayor, Jaime Barlucea , it decreased to 18.7 in 2011. However, according to the Department of Employment of Puerto Rico, it increased to 21.3.  \\n\nThe municipality of Adjuntas previously formed the Adjuntas Micropolitan Statistical Area , and it has been included in the Ponce Metropolitan Statistical Area since the 2020 US Census.  \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Adjuntas: Acueducto neighborhood, Calle del Agua, Guayo barrio, Rullán neighborhood, Saltillo Vaca, Tanamá barrio, and Yahuecas barrio.  \\n\nEconomy\nSince its foundation in the 19th century, the production of coffee, sugarcane , small fruits, and cattle have formed the foundation of the economy of Adjuntas. During the middle of the 20th century, however, the production of sugar declined with the arrival of manufacturing industries.  \\n\nAdjuntas is still the main producer of coffee on the island.    Other products produced in Adjuntas are tropical crops such as bananas, citron and peaches .\\n\nAfter the economic hardships caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, some economic gains were being made by a number of women working in agriculture in Adjuntas.  \\n\nDuring the middle of the 20th century, some manufacturing industries established themselves in town as part of Operation Bootstrap . However, as of 2012, most of them have already closed. One of the last manufacturing companies in town, a military uniforms company, closed in March 2012.  \\n\nAlthough tourism hasn\\'t been an integral part of the economy of Adjuntas, according to historic records, it has been present since the 19th century. Historian Lidio Cruz Monclóva noted that around 1871, some doctors requested patients to travel to Adjuntas to stay in a hotel called \"La Adjunteña\". The hotel was the property of C.L. Ginestre, and served both tourists and the sick. Cruz noted that doctors believed the colder temperatures of the town were beneficial to health.  \\n\nIn 2018, Adjuntas received approximately 700 tourists on weekends, according to mayor Jaime Barlucea .  Most of them want to visit the haciendas established there during past centuries. Some of them are: Hacienda Don Juan,  Hacienda Bareal, Hacienda El Muerto, Hacienda Arbela, and Hacienda Pietri. Other landmarks are Monte Guilarte , and the Inabón waterfall .\\n\nAnother known tourist stop in Adjuntas is Casa Pueblo , a local museum and cultural institution founded by a group of activists that fought against the copper mine exploitation of the area for decades. Casa Pueblo is responsible for many environmental projects, namely the preservation of hundreds of acres of woods and bodies of water.\\n\nHowever, some residents and businesspeople from Adjuntas maintain that the government has not taken advantage of the many tourist attractions in town, which include three forests , waterfalls , lakes, and many renowned restaurants.  One of the projects that has received media coverage is the Castillo de los Niños , built during the mayoralty of Barlucea. Castillo de los Niños is a recreational park resembling a castle, with gazebos .   \\n\nVilla Sotomayor is a parador , featuring ecotourism. Villa Sotomayor features food prepared with local ingredients, from a nearby estate Hacienda Nur .  \\n\nIn early 2021, in alliance with neighboring Lares , Adjuntas launched agri-tourism for tourists to visit haciendas where coffee is grown and processed.  \\n\nThere are two places in Adjuntas recognized for their historic significance: Las Cabañas Bridge , a one-lane bridge made of steel and concrete, which was built in 1919,  and Quinta Vendrell , a country house built in 1918.  The Washington Irving Grade School was also added to the US National Register of Historic Places in 2015.  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Adjuntas passport page lists the Hacienda Tres Angeles (for agritourism ), the Bosque Guilarte , and Lago Garza as places of interest for locals.  \\n\nHuman resources\nIn all of the island\\'s municipalities, public education is overseen by the Puerto Rico Department of Education . When Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States, there were already six public schools established in Adjuntas. Historian Cayetano Coll y Toste offered a detailed account of each of them, including the number of students, which at the time totaled 402.  \\n\nAs of 2018-2019 the following public schools were operational in Adjuntas:   \\n\nAlthough there are no hospitals in Adjuntas, the town does have a small treatment and diagnostic center located in Adjuntas Pueblo. Also, Castañer Hospital, which is located on the border between Adjuntas, Lares , and Maricao , offers services to the municipality.  \\n\nAccording to sources, there has not been a murder in Adjuntas since 2009.  However, burglary and theft have increased. Some residents attribute the rise in crime to unemployment and the lack of activities for the youth.  \\n\nCulture\nAdjuntas celebrates its patron saint festival in late July / early August. The Fiestas Patronales de San Joaquin & Santa Ana is a religious and cultural celebration in honor of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne . The festival generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Adjuntas include:\\n  \\n\nThe town has a professional volleyball team called Gigantes de Adjuntas that plays on the LVSM in Puerto Rico.   \\n\nTransportation\nIn 1874, General José Laureano Sanz, Governor of Puerto Rico , sponsored a road from Ponce to Arecibo , going across Adjuntas and Utuado . In 1885, it is believed that the road was under construction.  \\n\nNowadays, the main road to Adjuntas is PR-10 , that connects the cities of Ponce in the south and Arecibo in the north, going across Adjuntas in the center. Before the PR-10 was built, roads like the PR-123 , and other small roads were used to reach town.\\n\nThere is also a small airport in Adjuntas that caters to private airplanes.  \\n\nAdjuntas has 30 bridges.  Built in 1919, Las Cabañas Bridge , made of steel and concrete is a one-lane, historic bridge which remains in operation.  \\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years. As of 2021, the mayor of Adjuntas is José Hiram Soto Rivera, of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) .  The mayor before him was Jaime Barlucea.  Barlucea has been reelected three times since ( 2008 , 2012 , and 2016 ).  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two senators. In 2016, Luis A. Berdiel Rivera and Nelson Cruz, from the New Progressive Party , were elected as district senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe coat of arms of Adjuntas is divided in two. The left side features a shepherd\\'s staff crossed with a yarnwinder in a purple field. They symbolize the Old Testament patriarchs, representing Saint Joachim and Saint Anne , parents of the Virgin Mary . An eight-pointed star sits above them representing the Virgin.  \\n\nThe right side of the coat of arms is divided in three fields. The upper and lower field have green crosses in white fields. The crosses, known as \" flory or fleury \" are also present in the symbols of Coamo , because of the relationship between both towns. Two bells lie in the middle field, also a representation of the name of \"Adjuntas\".\\n\nTwo coffee branches surround the coat of arms, representing Adjuntas location and its importance in the coffee industry of the island. The castle at the top represents the title of village given to Adjuntas by Spain in 1894.  \\n\nThe flag of Adjuntas has similar symbolisms. A white diagonal stripe divides the flag in two triangles. The upper one is purple, while the lower one is green. In the middle of each triangle lies a white \"cross fleury\". The white color symbolizes purity, while purple represents Saint Joachim \\'s cloth and green the nature of the town.  \\n\nThe anthem of Adjuntas was written by José Nieves Pérez and is called \"Adjuntas, mi amor\".  \\n\nAdjuntas has several nicknames. One is \" La ciudad del gigante dormido \" (\"The city of the sleeping giant\"). This is a reference to one of the mountains of the city, which is compared to a \"sleeping giant\".  Another nickname is \" La Suiza de Puerto Rico \" (\"The Switzerland of Puerto Rico\") which is a reference to Adjuntas\\' relatively low temperatures. Adjuntas has an average yearly weather of 70 degrees Fahrenheit .  Finally, Adjuntas is also called \" La tierra de lagos \" (\"The land of lakes\") because of its many lakes.  \\n\nNotable Adjunteños\nAmong the notable Adjunteños are the following:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nAguada, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nAguada , originally San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada , is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico , located in the northwestern coastal valley region bordering the Atlantic Ocean, east of Rincón , south of Aguadilla , west of Moca ; and north of Añasco and Mayagüez . It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area . Aguada\\'s population is spread over 17 barrios and Aguada Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city).\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Aguada is a shortening of the town\\'s original name San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada. The word aguada literally translates to \"watery\" or \"watered down\" from Spanish, possibly a reference to the town\\'s strategic importance as a port in the Mona Passage and the Atlantic Ocean.\\n\nThe municipality has many nicknames: La Villa de Sotomayor (\"Sotomayor\\'s Villa\") is a reference to one of the town\\'s Spanish founders, Cristóbal de Sotomayor; La Ciudad del Descubrimiento (\"City of the Discovery\") is a reference to the possibility that Christopher Columbus first landed in Puerto Rico at what is today the municipality\\'s territory; El Pueblo Playero translates to \"the beach town\" and La Ciudad del Vaticano (\"the Vatican \\'s City\") which references the town\\'s early importance for Catholicism in the island.  \\n\nHistory\nA Taíno settlement called Aymamón was located close to the Culebrinas River .   \\n\nBahía de Aguada (Aguada Bay) in Aguada has historically been recognized as the location where Christopher Columbus first landed in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on 19 November 1493. However, it is believed by most historians that Bahía de Añasco (Añasco Bay) in the neighboring town of Añasco was the place of Columbus' first landing and stay of two days in Puerto Rico before continuing to La Navidad , first European settlement in the Americas , in Haiti in Hispaniola .    \\n\nIn July 1510, Cristóbal de Sotomayor received control of the area from Juan Ponce de León and renamed the town Villa de Sotomayor (Sotomayor Village) .  However, in 1511 the settlement was attacked and burned by the local Taínos . That same year, the Spanish crown ordered a monastery be established in Puerto Rico, and the Ermita de Espinar was founded. The name of the area was then changed to San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada , since the friars were Franciscan . The monastery was finished in 1516. \\n\nIn 1526, King Charles I of Spain officially founded the Aguada settlement. However, in 1529, Taínos attacked the monastery killing the friars and burning the settlement.  The Taínos , indigenous people of Puerto Rico, were believed to have practiced polytheism . As the Spanish began to colonize the Caribbean area, they wanted to convert the natives to Catholicism .  The Caribs destroyed a church of Franciscans in Aguada and killed five of its members in 1579.  \\n\nStill, Aguada resurfaced and became a stopover point for ships on their way to Spain from South America.  On September 17, 1692, King Charles II of Spain emitted a Royal Decree declaring Aguada a \"village\" and assigning Captain Juan López de Segura as War Lieutenant and Ordinary Mayor of the Villa de San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada.  \\n\nIn 1737, Philip V , King of Spain , declared that all mail en route to Venezuela and other South American countries from Puerto Rico should exit from Aguada\\'s ports, leading to the area\\'s economic growth. Also, an increase in population has been attributed to possible desertions from foreign merchant ships.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Aguada was 10,581.\\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, two disasters affected the town of Aguada. First, a huge fire in 1912 destroyed most of the town buildings, including the old city hall , which contained all the city archives. On October 11, 1918, at 10:14:42 local time an earthquake known as the San Fermín earthquake destroyed the church and other structures.  At Rio Culebrinas , 1000 kg blocks of limestone from the wrecked Columbus monument were carried inland to distances of 46-76 meters (151-249 feet) by waves 4.0 m (13.1 ft) high.  \\n\nHurricane María on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Aguada, with its strong winds and heavy rain.   Infrastructure and an estimated 8,000 homes in Aguada were damaged or destroyed. Two police officers died when they were caught in the flooded Culebrinas River .  \\n\nOn July 16, 2023 a tornado touched down in Aguada, producing EF1 damage which included tearing a roof from a house and damage to power lines.  The city is notorious for stormy weather. \\n\nEl Matador de Tiburones (The Aguada Shark Killer) is folklore that comes out of Aguada and was written around 1640. It tells of a young man who was accustomed to fighting sharks but was without his religious charm . When asked to demonstrate his shark-fighting capabilities to visiting Spanish dignitaries, he hesitated. All day and night he pondered whether he could fight a shark without his religious charm. Even though the Spaniards had increased their offer to 3 bars of gold the matador was hesitant. In the morning, as the shark came into the bay, the spectators who were gathered on the beach yelled in anticipation, and El Matador de Tiburones , as the young man was called, was unable to stop himself. He jumped into the open sea pursuing the shark and fought it with his bare hands. He was nearly killed and after receiving his prize of gold, vowed to never again fight a shark.  \\n\nGeography\nAguada is located in the west coast of the island of Puerto Rico . It borders the Atlantic Ocean and Aguadilla on the north, Moca on the east, Añasco on the south, and Rincón on the west. Aguada is part of the Coastal Plains of the West, which features alluvial and fertile terrain. Although the terrain is mostly plain, there are some mountains to the south and southeast.   \\n\nAmong the mountains located in Aguada are the Atalaya Peak, located within the limits of Aguada and Rincón. Also, San Francisco Mountain, which is popularly known as the birth point of the Cordillera Central , and Cerro Gordo, peaking at 853 feet (260 meters).  \\n\nAguada\\'s hydrographic system is composed of the Río Culebrinas , Río Grande , Río Cañas , Río Culebra , Río Guayabo , and Río Ingenio . All of these rivers flow into the Mona Passage .  According to a news article by Primera Hora , there are ten beaches in Aguada.  Aguada has an area of 45.55 square miles and 14.62% are water bodies.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Aguada is subdivided into barrios :     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (which means sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.   \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Aguada: Parcelas Noboa Vieja and Parcelas Noboa Nuevas in Guanaquilla barrio, Calle San Francisco, Calle San José, Comunidad Las Flores, Sector Las Bimbas in Luyando comunidad, Parcelas Matías, Parcelas Nieves , and Sector García .  \\n\nDemographics\nIn 2020, the population of Aguada decreased by 9.1% to 38,136. In 2010, the population of Aguada was 41,959, which represented a small decrease from the 42,042 registered in the 2000 Census.  Until its decrease in 2010, Aguada\\'s population had been increasing steadily.  \\n\nAccording to the 2020 Census, 22.7% of the population identifies themselves as White, and 10.6% as Black. Also, according to the census, the population is equally divided by gender (49.1% are males, while 50.1% are females). Finally, 23.7% of the population is under 18 years old. The next biggest percentage of population (20.8%) is between 35 and 49 years old.  \\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, the economy of Aguada was mostly based on the processing of sugarcane . The Central Coloso , located in the Guanábano barrio of Aguada, was one of the most important refineries in the island. It was also the last one to cease operations, officially closing in 2003.   Aside from sugar mills, there was also a cattle and wood industry. \\n\nThe commercial economy in Aguada reached a great boom in the 1950s. There were many commercial stores selling merchandise, grocery, hardware, and food products of all categories. \" La Villa de Sotomayor \" by Rivera & Rivera, Inc., founded around 1912 by Remigio Rivera Bonet, was the biggest and most important business in Aguada with an estimated income that exceeded the million dollars annually at that time.  Rivera & Rivera, Inc. had department stores, hardware stores, bakeries, travel agencies and LPG gas distribution, among other business in Aguada and the region. As of 2012, the Aguada economy relies mostly on small businesses and manufacturing.  \\n\nIn late 2014, the government announced a $172 million deal with private investors to restart sugar production in Puerto Rico for the purpose of supplying the island rum producers with up to 56% of the molasses needed. The plan involved building a new processing plant on the grounds of the old Coloso Sugar Cane factory in Aguada.  \\n\nAguada is part of the Porta del Sol touristic region in Puerto Rico. The Porta del Sol website highlights Aguada\\'s town square and beaches as its most notable touristic attractions.\\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Aguada passport page lists the Ermita Espinar which are ruins, Jeanmarie Chocolat , which was the first commercial chocolate farm in Puerto Rico, and Pirámide , the only pyramid in Puerto Rico, as places of interest.  \\n\nThe Puente de Coloso , built in 1928, is an 85-ft-long bridge which crosses over the Culebrinas River , and is located between the Guanábano and Espinar barrios in Aguada. It is recognized for its historic significance.   \\n\nThe only Oriental Orthodox Church in Puerto Rico specifically the Syriac Catholic Orthodox Church is located in Aguada near the downtown area in the Novoa II Community.  \\n\nHuman resources\nLike all other municipalities in the island, public education is overseen by the Puerto Rico Department of Education .

        "page_content": "Contents\nAguadilla, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nAguadilla , founded in 1775 by Luis de Córdova, is a city and municipality located in the northwestern tip of Puerto Rico , bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, north of Aguada , and Moca and west of Isabela . Aguadilla is spread over 15 barrios and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city and core of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nAguadilla is a shortening of the town\\'s original name San Carlos de La Aguadilla . The name Aguadilla is a diminutive of Aguada , which is the name of the town and municipality located to the south. Some of the municipality\\'s nicknames are: Jardín del Atlántico (\"Garden of the Atlantic \"), Pueblo de los Tiburones (\" Shark Town\") and La Villa del Ojo de Agua (\"Villa of the Water Spring \") after the natural water spring that was used by early settlers and Spanish soldiers as a water source which is now located in El Parterre Square in Aguadilla Pueblo .  \\n\nHistory\nAccording to sources, a Taíno settlement called Aymamón was located close to the Culebrinas River .  \\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of Aguada . In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de Córdova was approved.  But it was not until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Higüey barrios.  This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, Fray \\xc3\\x8dñigo Abbad y Lasierra in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos de La Aguadilla .\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. Agustín Stahl in his Foundation of Aguadilla , it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in 1775.  \\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when Santo Domingo became independent for the first time, the loyalists of Spanish descent emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don Pedro Tomás de Córdova, the area or \"party\" of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Montaña, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Higüey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual. [ citation needed ] \\n\nDon Pedro Tomás de Córdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"anchorage of the ships that travel from Europe to Havana and Mexico \". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\" [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a village.  Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, Isabela , Lares , Moca , Rincón , and San Sebastián . In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Higüey, and Mangual barrios are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas barrio appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new barrios are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Higüey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo barrios. Malezas barrio appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its barrios, and following instructions of city authorities, Higüey and parts of Caimital Alto barrios are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla .

During this period, Aguadilla was home to the Strategic Air Command , equipped with RB-36s and 72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy equipped with B-52s , an important strategic facility during the Cold War .\\nActivated in June 1952 as a Strategic Air Command very long-range reconnaissance unit at Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico, but not operational until October 1952. Redesignated as 72d Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and received 3 (60th, 73rd and 301st) squadrons of RB-36D/E/F/H Peacemaker bombers. Also, the 915th Air Rescue Squadron. Conducted global strategic reconnaissance 1953-1955, gradually shifting to a bombardment training mission beginning in 1954, being upgraded to B-36J and B-36J(III) Featherweights by 1955. Redesignated 72d Bombardment Wing in 1958. \\nWith the phaseout of the B-36s in 1958, received B-52G Stratofortress intercontinental strategic bombers.\\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the Government of Puerto Rico in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the Rafael Hernández International Airport . The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel. The Officer\\'s Club now hosts the Faro Conference Center, a 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m 2 ) meeting facility. The hospital is now the Courtyard by Marriott Punta Borinquen Resort & Casino,  a 150-room hotel with a casino and the first Marriott in Puerto Rico outside of the San Juan Metropolitan Area.\\n\nRamey also hosts the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla and the Friedrich Froebel Bilingual School (K-9).  The high school became Ramey Job Corps Campus  and the elementary school became the Esther Feliciano Mendoza Middle School. Centro de Adiestramiento y Bellas Artes (CABA) since 1979 has been the only public school of arts in Puerto Rico (7-12).

It was populated by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi , the place later to become known as San Antonio.\\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the 1918 San Fermín earthquake , the village was completely destroyed by a tsunami . The families suffered the struggles caused by this natural disaster due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey .\\n\nThe village\\'s infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go 9 miles (14 km) south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\\n\nIn September 1939, some 3,796 acres (15.4 km 2 ) covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as Ramey Air Force Base .\\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to Ramey Air Force Base . These expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other characteristics of a small town. The town also has a flag and an emblem. Roberto Román Acevedo designed the town flag and emblem.\\n\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the worst railroad accident in its history.  Train No. 3 was traveling from San Juan to Ponce carrying passengers to their hometowns for the island general elections being held that same day. It stopped at the Jiménez Station in Aguadilla for a routine engineer and boilerman exchange with Train No. 4, which was heading to San Juan. The engineer assigned to Train No. 3\\'s ride from Jiménez Station to Ponce was José Antonio Román, an experienced freight train engineer who had never worked on passenger trains.  When the train left the station at 2:00 am, it comprised 6 passenger cars with hundreds of passengers and two freight cars.\\n\nAt 2:20 a.m. the train started to descend a hill section in Aguadilla known as Cuesta Vieja (Old Hill) at, what some witnesses described as, excessive speed. When the train reached the leveling-off point at the bottom of the hill it derailed . The steam locomotive ran into a ditch, where it exploded, and one of the freight cars crashed into one of the passenger cars, killing many inside. Witnesses described the scene as horrendous, with some accounts stating that parents were throwing their children out the windows to save them from the wreckage.  Chief of Police Guillermo Arroyo stated that the locomotive (No. 72), the express car, and three second class passenger cars were completely destroyed. Oscar Valle, an Aguadilla correspondent to El Mundo newspaper, summarized the scene with: \"The locomotive suffered a terrible explosion as it derailed, and the impact was so strong that 3 passenger cars were converted into a fantastic mound of wreckage\".  In the end, 16 passengers lost their lives, including the engineer and the boilerman, and 50 were injured in the crash.  \\n\nHurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing large-scale damage and destruction to infrastructure.

        "page_content": "Contents\nAguas Buenas, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nAguas Buenas , , popularly known as \" La Ciudad de las Aguas Claras \" or \" The City of Clear Waters \", is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Central Mountain Range , north of Cidra , south of Bayamón , Guaynabo and San Juan ; east of Comerio ; and north-west of Caguas . Aguas Buenas is spread over 9 barrios and Aguas Buenas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Aguas Buenas translates to \"good waters\". The town \\'s and municipality\\'s original names were Aguabuena (\"good water\"), originally a barrio or district of Caguas , and Aguas Claras (\"clear waters\"). These names and some of the municipality\\'s nicknames such as Ciudad de las Aguas Claras (\"city of clear waters\") and Oasis de Puerto Rico (\" Puerto Rico \\'s oasis \") are a reference to the number of natural water springs that can be found in the municipality, particularly those founds around the Aguas Buenas Cave and Caverns System Nature Reserve . In addition to aguasbonenses , citizens and residents of Aguas Buenas are often referred to as Mulos (\"mules\") or \\xc3\\x91ocos (\"amputees\").  \\n\nHistory\nAguas Buenas was originally a sector of Caguas known as Aguabuena . In 1798, a group of residents started establishing their houses near some of the rivers in the area and started calling the sector Aguas Claras .\\n\nThe quantity of residents incremented with time and on July 25, 1832, they organized a meeting and commissioned Francisco de Salas Torres and Ramón Díaz to do the necessary arrangements for the region to be declared a municipality. A resident, Julian López, offered part of his estate to be used for the construction of a town square, a church, the city hall, and the priest house.\\n\nThe town was officially founded on May 25, 1838, and the name was changed to Aguas Buenas . Francisco de Salas Torres was declared the first mayor. Initially, the economy of the town relied on coffee plantations and commerce. At the end of the 19th century, the town\\'s population was close to 7,000.\\n\nIn 1906, mayor Don José E. Morales bought nearly six acres of terrain from Don Guillermo Díaz Delgado. In these lands, the sectors of La Pajilla, El Pueblito and El Guanábano were established, expanding the town\\'s area.\\n\nThe epicenter of the 2010 Aguas Buenas earthquake , popularly known as the Nochebuena Earthquake , was centered between the barrios Juan Asencio , Mulita and Sonadora .  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Aguas Buenas with the significant amount of rainfall.   Between1,000 and 3,000 homes in Aguas Buenas were destroyed or suffered significant damage as a result of the hurricane. A year after the hurricane struck, many older residents refused to leave their damaged homes and continued to live in their homes, without a reconstructed roof, but with a blue tarp for a roof.  The hurricane winds and rain damaged infrastructure and caused the entire electrical system to collapse.  \\n\nGeography\nThe terrain is moderately mountainous located in the northern edge of the Cayey mountain range ( Sierra de Cayey ), part of the Cordillera Central in Puerto Rico .

        "page_content": "Contents\nAibonito, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nAibonito  is a small mountain town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the Sierra de Cayey mountain range, north of Salinas ; south of Barranquitas and Comerío ; east of Coamo ; and west of Cidra , and Cayey . Aibonito is spread over 8 barrios and Aibonito Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nAibonito is located at a relatively high elevation (its main square is the highest in the island at 732 metres (2,401 ft) above sea level), which makes its climate cooler than most of Puerto Rico \\'s towns.\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Aibonito is possibly a combination of Spanish and Taíno from Hatibon or Jatibon , which the native name of the Aibonito River . Jatibon most likely translates to \"black river\" or \"night river\", the indigenous name of the river which was later turned into a diminutive in Spanish ( Jatibon-ito ). It is common to have native place names in Puerto Rico be historically adopted and modified into the Spanish language such as Mucarabones for example, which is a plural of Mucarabon , meaning \" owl river\" in Taíno.\\n\nThere\\'s also a legend that tells of a Spanish soldier called Diego Alvarez who on May 17, 1615, reached one of the highest peaks in the area and upon watching the view, exclaimed \"\\xc2 1Ay, qué bonito!\" (\" Oh, how pretty! \") which eventually was turned into the name of the region. If this is the case, it would be considered folk etymology .  \\n\nSome of the municipality\\'s nicknames include Ciudad de las Flores (\"City of Flowers\") and Jardín de Puerto Rico (\"Puerto Rico\\'s Garden\") after the region\\'s floral industry and annual festival , and Ciudad Fría (\"Cold City\") and Nevera de Puerto Rico (\"Puerto Rico\\'s refrigerator \") after the fact that the municipality has recorded some of the island\\'s lowest temperatures.  \\n\nHistory\nBefore the Spanish colonization of the Americas , it is believed that there were Taíno settlements in the region that belonged to Cacique Orocobix domain.\\n\nAfter the Spanish arrived, it is believed that a ranch was established in the region by Pedro Zorascoechea in 1630, which led the development of a hamlet . However, it wasn\\'t until 1822 when Don Manuel Veléz presented himself before the government, representing the inhabitants of the area, to ask for Aibonito to be officially declared a town. This was authorized on March 13, 1824, by Governor Don Miguel de la Torre . The first Catholic church in Aibonito was built in 1825. The building was replaced by the current church, which was started in 1887 and completed in 1897. After the town was officially constituted, barrios started developing in the area.\\n\nOn the Spanish-American War of 1898, around 800 Spanish and Puerto Rican soldiers were able to defeat the invading American troops due to their strategic placement in Asomante Mountain . This scrimmage came to an end when the Spanish government surrendered on August 12, 1898. The Spanish and Puerto Rican forces at Asomante never surrendered and would have held their position indefinitely if not for the buckling of the Spanish government in Madrid .\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Aibonito was 8,596.\\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Aibonito with the significant amount of rainfall.    Around 1,500 homes were completely or partially destroyed. The hurricane destroyed the poultry industry of Aibonito with nearly 1.8 million chickens killed. Known as \"The Garden of Puerto Rico\" Aibonito has celebrated a flower festival since 1969. Aibonito\\'s floriculture industry was completely decimated by Hurricane María.  \\n\nGeography\nAibonito is located in the Sierra de Cayey , part of the Cordillera Central in Puerto Rico .  Aibonito is the town with the highest elevation in Puerto Rico , located at 2,401 feet above sea level. Some of its mountains are La Sierra (2,394 ft), Asomante (2,042 ft) and Buena Vista (2,042 ft).  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Aibonito is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Aibonito: the Municipal neighborhood, Algarrobo barrio, Amoldadero and Los Muros in La Plata barrio, El Campito, El Coquí, El Fresal, La Españolita, La Represa, Las Bambúas, Los Cuadritos, Parcelas Nuevas in Pasto barrio, Parcelas Rabanal, Parcelas Viejas in Pasto, San Luis, Sector El Nueve, and Sector Gallera.  \\n\nSome of the rivers that flow through Aibonito are the Río de Aibonito , Río Cuyón , Río de la Plata and Río Usabón . Rio Manu\\n\nAibonito features a rather mild tropical rainforest climate , owing to its elevation and location, close but still slightly removed from the equator, as well as being directly exposed to the wind and moisture of the Trade Winds . It borders on a subtropical highland climate , and also a humid subtropical climate , though like the former, summers are not much hotter than the warm to cool winters, as it is typical of higher elevations near the equator. As the trade winds coming from the northeast go through orographic lift , rainfall is both greater and more consistent throughout the year than in coastal areas (particularly the south coast only minutes away), with fog being a common occurrence. Aibonito holds the record for the lowest temperature in Puerto Rico. That is 40 °F (4 °C) on March 9, 1911.  The highest temperature record is 98 °F (37 °C) recorded on September 29, 1920.  Aibonito is among Puerto Rico\\'s coolest towns.\\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nTwo of the older landmarks of Aibonito are the Old Encanto Theater , and Moscoso Pharmacy . Their building facades reflect early 20th century architecture. The Mirador Overlook allows for panoramic views of the Plata Valley . The Degetau Stone (in Spanish : La Piedra de Degetau ) was where Federico Degetau, a writer, found his inspiration. Casa Museo Federico Degetau is the restored, house museum of the writer. San José Church , which was designed by architect Pedro Cobreros between 1887 and 1897, was built in 1898 is located in the central plaza. There is a plaque commemoration the 100th anniversary of the Spanish-American War at Asomante Memorial, a place with a view of the Central Mountain Range . The Asomante Trench in Spanish : La Trinchera de Asomante is where part of the Spanish-American War took place. The main square is named after Segundo Ruíz Belvis , a national abolitionist hero. The San Cristóbal Canyon , a nine-kilometers-long canyon with waterfalls is located between Aibonito and Barranquitas. In Robles barrio there is an iron bridge with PR-176 and was built in 1892. The annual Festival of Flowers is celebrated each June in Aibonito.  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Aibonito passport page lists Mirador Piedra Degetau , Casa Museo Federico Degetau , Meyer\\'s Nurseries for agritourism , and several travel routes through Aibonito including the Ruta de Las Flores , Ruta del Pollo , and Ruta Cultural as places of interest.  \\n\nCulture\nAibonito had a BSN basketball franchise called the Polluelos de Aibonito .  In 1986 they beat the defending champions, Atléticos de San Germán , in seven games to win their only championship. In 1987, the Polluelos reached the finals once again, but that time, they lost in seven games to the Titanes de Morovis . Recently, the Polluelos have not been able to see action on the BSN\\'s tournaments because of economic and team ownership problems.\\nAlso Aibonito had a Double AA baseball. The franchise is also Polluelos de Aibonito. In 1966 they won their only baseball championship.\\n\nAibonito celebrates its patron saint festival in late July or early August.

        "page_content": "Contents\nArecibo, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nArecibo  is a city and municipality on the northern coast of Puerto Rico , on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean , located north of Utuado and Ciales ; east of Hatillo ; and west of Barceloneta and Florida . It is about 50 miles (80 km) west of San Juan , the capital city. Arecibo is the largest municipality in Puerto Rico by area, and it is the core city of the Arecibo Metropolitan Statistical Area and part of the greater San Juan-Bayamón, PR Combined Statistical Area .  It is spread over 18 barrios and Arecibo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). Its population in 2020 was 87,754.\\n\nThe Arecibo Observatory , which housed the Arecibo telescope , the world\\'s largest radio telescope until July 2016, is located in the municipality. The Arecibo telescope collapsed on December 1, 2020. Arecibo is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arecibo .\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Arecibo comes from the Taíno chief Xamaica Arasibo , cacique of the yucayeque (Taíno settlement) of Abacoa where the Spanish town of Arecibo was settled in 1556. The word Arasibo itself most likely comes from the Taíno words ara , possibly meaning or related to \"people\", and siba , most likely meaning \"rock\" or \"stone\". This name also lends itself to the name of the river which flows through the municipality into the Atlantic Ocean .  \\n\nSome of the city\\'s nicknames are: Villa del Capitán Correa (\"Villa of Captain Correa\"), after Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa , a Spanish soldier who famously and successfully defended the city from a British invasion; La Muy Leal (\"the very loyal [one]\") after the title often granted to Spanish colonial cities; and Diamante del Norte (\" Diamond of the North\") due to the city\\'s location in the northern coast of the island.  \\n\nHistory\nWhen the Spanish arrived, they found the area occupied by the indigenous Taíno , led by Xamaica Arasibo , Cacique (chief) of the yucayeque (town) then named Abacoa.   \\n\nSpanish colonists settled Arecibo in 1556, which they named for the cacique. It was their fourth settlement on the island, after Caparra (which later became San Juan ), San German , and Coamo .  Arecibo was officially founded as a town  by the Spanish crown on May 1, 1616, under the governorship of Captain Felipe de Beaumont y Navarra , when the King of Spain granted the land (and the Taino living there) to Lope Conchillos.  \\n\nFor some time the island was competed for by other European powers. On August 5, 1702, Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa , a member of the Spanish Army , successfully defended Arecibo from a British Navy invasion led by rear-admiral William Whetstone . Commanding two British Navy ships and 40 men, Whetstone tried to take control of the city. Correa ambushed his forces, killing 22 British seamen and driving them off. The Spanish defenders suffered only one death and three wounded soldiers. This gave the city its nickname The Village of Captain Correa ( La Villa del Capitan Correa )\\n\nIn 1778, Arecibo, by royal decree, was awarded the \"Villa\" status, though it was not integrated as such until 1802. In 1850 it was awarded the \"Muy Leal\" (very loyal) title.  Over time, large part of its territory became separate municipalities. These include Manati , Barceloneta , Florida , Utuado , Jayuya , Hatillo , Camuy , Quebradillas and Isabela . In 1982, it was promoted to city status, though it continued to be known by its previous nickname.\\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered extensive flooding, and damage to infrastructure with over 3,000 people losing their homes. Two hospitals were damaged and the hurricane caused deaths as well.  \\n\nGeography\nArecibo is located in the Northern Coastal Plain region of Puerto Rico, extending inland into the Northern Karst region. It lies on the Atlantic Ocean ; north of Utuado ; east of Hatillo ; and west of Barceloneta and Florida . The city occupies an area of 127 square miles (330 km 2 ), of which, 45.23 sq mi (117.1 km 2 ), is water.   \\n\nThe Rio Grande de Arecibo is the main river in the municipality, running through the middle of it. South of the municipality, in the karst region, it forms the Dos Bocas Lake , a primary source of water for Northern Puerto Rico. Several rivers feed the Rio Grande, including the Tanama River . Caño Santiago is an artificial canal created in the 19th century by partially diverting the Tanama River\\'s waters tobarrios a small temporary stream, to supply water to poor neighborhoods in Arecibo, discharging into the Arecibo River near its own mouth. In the 1950s it was modified to pass slightly more south of the city center. Poor maintenance, sediment and pollution has turned the canal once again into a temporary stream. East of the river lies Caño Tiburones , an important marshland area that provides habitat for many kinds of birds and wildlife.\\n\nArecibo has two forest reserves. Cambalache State Forest is located along the Barceloneta municipal limits, while Rio Abajo State Forest is located between Arecibo and Utuado . Caves include Cueva Ventana , which overlooks the valley formed by the Rio Grande de Arecibo, and Cueva del Indio (Cave of the Indian), where paintings made by prehistoric indigenous peoples have been seen.\\n\nEnvironmental impact studies have been done to consider remedies for flooding that often occurs in Arecibo.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Arecibo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.   \\n\nBarrios (which for US census purposes, are like minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Arecibo: \\n Animas - Factor 1, Sector Los Muertos in Arrozal, Sector El Jobo in Rio Arriba, Sector El Valle in Rio Arriba, Buenos Aires (Magallanes), Calichoza, Canta Gallo, Carreras, Cruz Roja, El Cerro - Factor 1, Abra San Francisco, El Vigía, Esperanza (Cienagueta), La Planta, Palo Blanco, and Sector Carolina in Sabana Hoyos .  \\n\nTropical monsoon climate, occasionally also known as a tropical wet climate or tropical monsoon and trade-wind littoral climate in climate classification, is a relatively rare type of climate. The K\\xc3\\xb6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \" Am \". (Tropical Monsoon Climate).  \\n\nTourism\nThe Arecibo Harbor is managed by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority .  \\n\nArecibo is one of the oldest colonial towns in Puerto Rico (1616). Among its historic buildings is the Cathedral of Saint Philip the Apostle , built beginning in the late 18th century. The first church, built in the middle of the 17th century, was destroyed by an earthquake in 1787 . Construction of its replacement began soon after, although it was not completed until 1846. Four days after its dedication, another earthquake seriously damaged it. Repairs were not completed until 1882. The 1918 earthquake damaged the vault so badly that it was replaced by a flat concrete roof; a vaulted ceiling of composition board was placed inside.\\n\nThe cathedral of Arecibo is Puerto Rico\\'s second-largest church after the Cathedral of San Juan . The plan is rectangular with three naves ; the side naves are cut short to allow large flanking chapels, which occupy almost half the length of the church. The apse is semicircular, and has an unusual half-dome covering it. The facade is a triangular composition of three stages. The top stage, a short central tower, is a later addition, according to local architects and historians. Neoclassic ornamentation is used in an academic fashion on the lowest stage, but the other two show a less traditional use of bands and pilasters . The Renaissance-style windows are uncommon in Puerto Rican churches, but the central tower over the entrance is a common motif used throughout the island.\\n\nThe City Hall , built in 1866, served as jail to revolutionaries of El Grito de Lares in 1868. In the 1918 earthquake, the frontal section of the building was destroyed. When repairs were made, a tower and clock were added to the building. In 1978, the building was restored to its original form.\\n\nThe City Hall of Arecibo is typical of these regional seats of government. It is relatively modest in size, of stuccoed masonry, with an academically correct composition, having a pedimented center pavilion which projects slightly. The lower story is rusticated, with arched openings; the three doorways in the center giving the effect of a loggia . The upper windows all have segmental pediments and balconies; the central trio share one long balcony. Architectural detailing is modest, but the building is graceful and charming.\\n\nIn 1898 the Spaniards built the Punta Los Morrillos Lighthouse . It was automated in 1964 and is still in use. A small park, Arecibo Lighthouse and Historical Park, has been established around it.\\n\nThe Arecibo Observatory was the home of Arecibo telescope , once the largest single-aperture radio telescope ever constructed and one of the world\\'s most powerful radar-radio telescopes. The observatory\\'s purpose was to support scientific studies. It attracted several Hollywood directors who have filmed there; most recently GoldenEye and Contact . The radio telescope was used in 1974 to send the Arecibo message to space. The telescope collapsed in 2020.\\nCasa Ulanga was originally a residence built by Spanish immigrant Francisco Ulanga, and has served multiple uses over the years. It was used as a bank, store, city hall of Arecibo, hospital, jail, tribunal, and is now operated as the Arecibo Cultural Center.\\n\nCueva del Indio is an archeological site where Taíno drawings can be found.\\n\nThe \" Birth of the New World \" is a statue depicting Christopher Columbus and is located in Islote , Arecibo.   295 ft (90 m). The statue is the work of Russian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli , and it is the tallest statue in the Americas.  \\n\nOther places of interest in Arecibo include:\\n\nArecibo beaches include Los Morillos, Los Negritos, Poza del Obispo, and Las Tunas. Pozo del Obispo Beach in Arecibo is considered a dangerous beach.  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Arecibo passport page lists Cueva Ventana , Museo Casa Trina Padilla de Sanz , and the Arecibo Light House and Historical Park, as places of interest.  \\n\nCulture\nArecibo began celebrating its patron saint festival in 1616.  Arecibo celebrates its patron saint festival in May. The Fiestas Patronales de San Felipe Apostol is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Arecibo include:\\n\nArecibo has two professional sports franchises, the Lobos de Arecibo in the Roberto Clemente Professional Baseball League (a.k.a. Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente or LBPRC), and the Capitanes de Arecibo in the National Superior Basketball League (Baloncesto Superior Nacional or BSN).\\n\nThe Lobos won the 1983 then-known Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico (LBPPR) national baseball championship and the 1983 Caribbean World Series , the only time the franchise won both titles. At that time, they had MLB prospect Dickie Thon , then also of the Houston Astros , on their roster. Thon then suffered a life-threatening and career-affecting eye injury during an Astros game in 1984. The Lobos won a championship again in 1996.\\n\nThe Capitanes won their first ever BSN national championship in 1959. After that, the Capitanes have not had much luck in their basketball tournaments for the next few decades. However, that would begin to change in 2002, as they started to turn things around, by reaching the BSN semifinals; yet they lost the series to the Vaqueros de Bayamón by losing four straight games, after having a 3-0 series lead, thus failing their chances to make into the finals. In 2005, the Capitanes won the BSN national championship by defeating the Vaqueros de Bayamón in a four-game sweep. This was the first championship in 46 years. In 2007 they got to the finals, losing in the overtime on the seventh game of the series against the Cangrejeros de Santurce . In 2008 Arecibo won their third BSN national championship, this time against the Gigantes de Carolina . In 2010, they won their fourth BSN national title in six seasons, this time against the Vaqueros de Bayamón.\\n\nEconomy\nArecibo\\'s economy is diverse with pharmaceuticals, agriculture and fishing.  Vaqueria Ceiba Del Mar is located in Arecibo and is one of the largest on the island of Puerto Rico. They also have operations in Hatillo . After Hurricane Maria , the farm had to consolidate their three operations into one.\\n\nArecibo\\'s main shopping mall is Plaza del Atlantico as well as the one situated in the neighboring town of Hatillo , Plaza del Norte .\\n\nIn 2021, Hilton was constructing a hotel in Arecibo.  \\n\nArecibo is home to Fortune 500 corporations such as Merck , General Electric . Other important companies are Thermo King Corporation, Eaton, Los Cidrines, Expressway Eco Printing, Arecibo Tropical Flag and ABB.\\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2010 Census the municipality of Arecibo is 99% Hispanic of which 78% identifies as white (of European descent), 4.6% black ( Afro-Puerto Rican descent), and 1.2% with two or more races.  The majority of the population is mostly of Spanish descent, but there has been intermarriage with more recent groups from other parts of Europe, with some having Middle Eastern, French , Italian, American or of other descent. People who are multi-racial may also have ancestors more than one of the European groups, and among more than one African nation as well.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Arecibo was 36,910.\\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor , elected every four years. The current mayor of Arecibo is Carlos (Tito) Ramírez Irizarri , of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). He was elected at the 2020 general elections .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district III , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012 , José Pérez Rosa ( PNP ) and Angel Martínez ( PNP ) were elected as District Senators,  and they were re-elected in 2016 .  In 2020 Elizabeth Rosa Vélez ( PPD ) and Rubén Soto Rivera ( PPD ) were elected as District Senators and are the current Senators of this Senatorial district.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  The flag and coat of arms were adopted in 1968 with Resolution 12 passed by the government of Arecibo.   \\n\nThe flag of Arecibo derives its composition and colors from the coat of arms of the city. It is divided vertically in two equal parts. The left side is blue having a belt that stands for \"Captain Correa\", a local military hero from Spanish times. The right side is made up of blue and yellow diamonds alternating in a checkerboard pattern referring to the coat of arms of Felipe de Beaumont y Navarra, governor of Puerto Rico (1614-1620) and founder of the city. The crown represents The Cacique (chieftain) Arasibo (Fransico Jamaica Arasibo). The turtles represent the ancientness of the city (the third city of Puerto Rico) also because of the indigenous people of the region and that the hunting of turtles was a source of wealth. The towers were a form to describe the population of a settlement. Three towers represent a municipality, four towers represent a village, and five towers represent a city.   \\n\nThe shield is divided by diagonal lines in golden and blue rhombuses with a blue stripe in the superior part, in which resides an opened five-point crown and which is adorned with drawings characterizing the art of the Taínos. The people of Arecibo also honored Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa by including a gold colored belt in their coat of arms with the words \"Muy Leal\", which means \"Very Faithful\", in representation of Correa.  This combination of symbols represents the Indian Cacique (Chieftain) from whom the population\\'s name derives, the governor that erected the town and the hero Captain Correa who defended the town from a British invasion.  \\n\nArecibo is known as \"La Villa del Capitán Correa\" (Captain Correa\\'s Villa) after the Puerto Rican hero Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa of the Spanish Army, who drove off a British Navy invasion by ambushing forces led by rear-admiral William Whetstone . Arecibo is also known as \"El Diamante Del Norte\" (The Diamond of the North).\\n\nTransportation\nArecibo has a small noncommercial airport, named Antonio (Nery) Juarbe Pol Airport , which currently has no commercial airline flights.\\n\nPR-22 (unsigned Interstate PR-2) passes through the city, but bypasses downtown. Downtown can be accessed via PR-2 , PR-10 and PR-129 .\\n\nThere are 51 bridges in Arecibo.  \\n\nThe Puente Victor Rojas collapsed during Hurricane Georges in 1998 but was rebuilt.  Despite it being an important bridge leading into the urban downtown center of Arecibo, it was closed again in early 2017 due to damage caused by the sea and reopened in 2021 after repairs.   \\n\nEducation\nThe first school in Arecibo was established on October 12, 1805.  \\n\nToday, Arecibo is home to several public and private schools distributed through its barrios.

        "page_content": "Contents\nArroyo, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nArroyo  is a town and municipality located along the southern coast of Puerto Rico and bordered by the Caribbean Sea , east of the municipality of Guayama and northwest of the municipality of Patillas . Arroyo is spread over 5 barrios and Arroyo barrio-pueblo (the downtown area and administrative center). It is part of the Guayama Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nIt is believed that the name of Arroyo (which means \" creek \" or \" brook \" in English ) is derived from a small water stream where travelers stopped to freshen up before continuing on their way.  \\n\nAccording to legend, one the town\\'s first nicknames, Pueblo Ingrato (\"Ungrateful Town\"), comes from the locals in the 19th century who either burned or drowned a resident who contracted either cholera or the bubonic plague , even though he was renowned for his generosity. In the last century, however, there has been a push to change the nickname to Pueblo Grato (\"Grateful Town\") in order to clean the town\\'s modern, laid back and friendly reputation.  \\n\nResidents of Arroyo are often referred to as Bucaneros (\" Buccaneers \"), a reference to the region\\'s historic pirate and buccaneer activities. The main sports teams of the municipality, most notably its volleyball team, are also called Los Bucaneros .  \\n\nHistory\nThe town of Arroyo was officially founded on December 25, 1855. However, some historians believe there were previous settlements in the area even previous to the Spanish colonization .  There are four different versions about the founding of the town, including that it was formed when a small group of people from the neighbor town of Guayama came to the region looking for a port to export and import merchandise.  Still, in 1868, a local newspaper called La Gaceta de Puerto Rico stated that Arroyo was founded in 1852. Between 1859 and 1860, City Hall signed agreements to open streets and build a town square and a sewer system for the town.\\n\n\\nIn 1858, Samuel Morse introduced wired communication to Latin America when he established a telegraph system in Puerto Rico , then a Spanish Colony . Morse\\'s oldest daughter Susan Walker Morse (1821-1885), would often visit her uncle Charles Pickering Walker who owned the Hacienda Concordia in the town of Guayama . During one of her visits she met and later married Edward Lind, a Danish merchant who worked in the Hacienda La Henriqueta in Arroyo.  Lind purchased the Hacienda from his sister when she became a widow. Morse, who often spent his winters at the Hacienda with his daughter and son-in-law, set a two-mile telegraph line connecting his son-in-law\\'s Hacienda to their house in Arroyo. The line was inaugurated on March 1, 1859, in a ceremony flanked by the Spanish and American flags.   The first lines transmitted by Samuel Morse that day in Puerto Rico were: \n\"Puerto Rico, beautiful jewel! When you are linked with the other jewels of the Antilles in the necklace of the world\\'s telegraph, yours will not shine less brilliantly in the crown of your Queen!\"\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Arroyo was 4,867.  \\n\nIn 1902, Puerto Rico\\'s Legislative Assembly approved a law to consolidate certain municipalities. According to it, Arroyo would be merged with Guayama starting on July 1 of that year. However, the law was revoked in 1905 returning Arroyo to its municipal status.\\n\nIn early 1999, the U.S. Congressional record documented a commendation of Arroyo, on its 100-year relationship with the U.S., noting that many citizens of Arroyo, such as Virgilio Sánchez and Raul Serrano, have fought and died in wars for the U.S.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria \\'s wind and rainfall triggered numerous landslides in Arroyo.   The hurricane destroyed 1,550 structures in Arroyo. A bridge on PR-725 collapsed leaving 130 families trapped.  \\n\nGeography\nArroyo belongs to the alluvial plains sub-region of Ponce - Patillas known as the Southern Coastal Valley. The area is very dry although its plains are productive thanks to artificial irrigation .  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Arroyo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.    \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Arroyo: the Marín neighborhood, Palmas barrio, Yaurel barrio, and the San Felipe-Arizona zone.  \\n\nThe Nigua River crosses the municipality from north to south. Its hydrographic system is completed by a series of smaller rivers. There is also a mineral water spring in Virella Colony.  \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nThere are eight beaches in Arroyo.  \\n\nAmong the places of interest in Arroyo are the Enrique Huyke Monument, dedicated to the educator and athlete, and the Samuel Morse Monument, dedicated to the American inventor of the telegraph . Casa de Aduana is a museum located in Arroyo.  \\n\nOther landmarks are Hacienda La Cora, Las Palmas Beach,  Punta Guilarte,  Punta de Las Figuras Lighthouse and the Arroyo Sugar Cane Train .  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Arroyo passport page lists Malecón Paseo Las Américas , Centro Vacacional Punta Guilarte , Faro Punta Figuras , and the Arroyo Surfing Park, as places of interest.  \\n\nCulture\nArroyo celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Sra. del Carmen is a religious and cultural celebration in honor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nA traditional carnaval is held in the month of February. Fiesta Negra , which celebrates the African heritage of the island, is held in March. The Festival del Pescao is celebrated in November.  \\n\nAlthough Arroyo doesn\\'t have a professional sports team, it has several amateur teams in Class A category [ citation needed ] .\\n\nThe Museo Antigua Aduana is a historic building that now showcases art by local artists, such as Angel Cora.  In 2011, the Cine Renacimiento (Renaissance Cinema), which was founded in 1922, re-opened after a little over a year of construction to transform into a theater space compatible with new uses and now known as Teatro Renacimiento (Renaissance Theater). It is located at Morse St. (PR-178) and Arizona 7 St.  \\n\nEconomy\nDuring past centuries, Arroyo was known for the production of sugar in the Central Lafayette ,  a sugar mill.   \\n\nIn recent years, manufacture and pharmaceutical industries have taken control of the economy of Arroyo. Stryker Corporation , a developer of medical implants and other surgical equipment, has a production plant in the town.\\n\nGovernment\nSince its foundation, Arroyo\\'s municipal government has been led by a mayor , with its first mayor being Marcelino Cintrón. The current mayor is Eric Bachier Román . [ citation needed ] The city also has a municipal legislature that handles local legislative matters.  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VI , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Miguel Pereira Castillo and Angel Rodríguez Otero were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  Arroyo\\'s flag has two horizontal bands of equal size. The upper band is color orange, while the lower one is black. In the middle of the flag lies Arroyo\\'s coat of arms.   \\n\nThe coat of arms is also split in two sections. The upper section features a church in a blue field a church with a rosary to the right and a flower to the left. The lower section features two silver telegraph poles on green hills. At the bottom, waving stripes of blue and silver, with a fish below them. Above the shield, lies a crown of three towers filled in with purple. Below there\\'s a banner with the motto, Arroyo Pueblo Grato .  \\n\nEducation\nEducation is handled by the Puerto Rico Department of Education. Arroyo has seven elementary schools , three junior high schools , and one high school .\\n\nTransportation\nDuring the peak of the sugarcane industry in the island, Arroyo was part of the railroad system of the island, with trains hauling production to other municipalities in the island. A small portion of that train remained in use until recently for tourism purposes, under the name of Tren del Sur .\\n\nTo reach Arroyo, visitors have to take the Puerto Rico Highway 3 .

        "page_content": "Contents\nAñasco, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nAñasco , named after one of its settlers, Don Luis de Añasco, is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located on the west coast of the island bordering the Mona Passage to the west, north of Mayagüez , and Las Marias ; south of Rincón , Aguada , and Moca and west of San Sebastián and Las Marias . It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Añasco comes from Don Luis de Añasco, former owner of the land where the town and municipality were founded. This family name is of Spanish origin from the province of Extremadura .  \\n\nSome of the municipality\\'s nicknames include: La ciudad donde los dioses mueren (\"The city where gods die\") and Los nativos (\"the natives\") are a reference to the legend of Spanish conquistador Diego Salcedo , who according to the story was drowned by the indigenous Taíno in order to prove that the European colonizers were not immortal deities; and Pueblo del Hojaldre (\" Puff Pastry Town\") after the hojaldre , a type of puff pastry the municipality is famous for.  \\n\nHistory\nAlthough the Bahía de Aguada (Aguada Bay) in the neighboring town of Aguada , commonly known as the Ciudad del Descubrimiento (City of the Discovery) , has historically been recognized as the location where Christopher Columbus first landed in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on 19 November 1493, it is believed by most historians that Bahía de Añasco  (Añasco Bay) in Añasco was the place of Columbus' first landing and stay of two days in Puerto Rico before continuing to La Navidad , first European settlement in the Americas , in Haiti in Hispaniola .    \\n\nThe town of Añasco was founded on October 18, 1733, and named after Don Luis de Añasco, a colonist from the Extremadura region of Spain who came to Puerto Rico with Juan Ponce de León . Añasco was founded by the initiative of rich landowner Don José de Santiago, who wanted to establish the villa in properties owned by Don Luis de Añasco. The property was located on the margins of the río Guaorabo , as the Taínos called it.   \\n\nAñasco town was preceded by the first settlement in the western part of Puerto Rico, San Germán . In November 1511, Juan Ponce de León handed over governorship to Juan Cerón , a lieutenant of the viceroy Diego Colon (son of Cristobal Colon or Cristopher Columbus ). Cerón ordered Miguel de Toro, a lieutenant of Juan Ponce de León, to create a \"Christian Village\" in western Borinquen , calling it San Germán. This was the second attempt of foundation given in 1511 at the mouth of the Guaorabo River (present day Rio Añasco ), near the area known today as Añasco, Puerto Rico. This first settlement was attacked in 1528, 1538, and again in 1554. A fort to protect this town began in 1540, but its construction was suspended in 1546 when the people decided to move inland being tired of attacks. Attacks by Carib Indians forced the population to move south inland to the present site of the present town of San Germán [ citation needed ] .\\n\nThe Añasco River is also claimed to be the site of the popular legend of the drowning of the Spaniard Diego Salcedo in 1511 at the hands of the Taínos , proving the Spanish soldiers were not gods and igniting a revolt. It is believed that the revolt was led by the cacique \" Cacique Chayoán\" (Uruyoán) and suppressed by Spanish soldiers.  \\n\nMany of the first settlers to the area came from the Canary Islands and the south of Spain . The 1918 San Fermín earthquake destroyed Añasco\\'s parish church, the town hall and other buildings, almost eliminating most of the historic downtown structures.\\n\nHurricane María on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Añasco. In some areas of Añasco there were more than 25 landslides per square mile due to the significant amount of rainfall.   Barrio Playa was particularly affected with about 96% of the homes under water.  Bridges in and around Añasco sustained extensive damage as a result of Hurricane María.  \\n\nGeography\nAñasco is located in the Coastal Plains of the west, bordered by the Río Grande de Añasco . It is bordered in the north by Rincón , Aguada , and Moca ; Mayagüez to the south; and San Sebastián and Las Marías to the east. The Mona Passage lies to the west of the town.  The Añasco terrain is mostly plain but features a series of hills and mountains like Canta Gallo (1,194 feet, or 364 meters), Gordo and Pichón (both at 1,115 feet, or 340 meters).  It is also crossed by several rivers like Icaco River, Caguabo River, La Balsa, and others.   \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Añasco is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion .

The Andalusian and Canarian Spaniards also influenced much of the Puerto Rican culture which explains the Southern Spanish dialect , and the Spanish colonial architecture .\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Añasco was 13,311.\\n\nTourism\nThere are 18 beaches in Añasco.  Tres Hermanos Beach is a well-known Añasco beach  which remained closed for more than two years after Hurricane Maria destroyed it in September 2017.

        "page_content": "Contents\nBarceloneta, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nBarceloneta  is a town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the north region, bordering the Atlantic Ocean , north of Florida (city and municipality in Puerto Rico), east of Arecibo , and west of Manatí . Barceloneta is spread over 3 barrios and Barceloneta Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Barceloneta (\"Little Barcelona \") is derived from the Spanish city, from where the town\\'s founder originated. Barceloneta is also the name of a beach and neighborhood of Barcelona.  \\n\nHistory\nBarceloneta was founded on July 1, 1881 by Bonocio Llenza Feliú,  an immigrant from Barcelona , Spain . Barceloneta was one of the last municipalities created by the Spanish Government in Puerto Rico.   \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Barceloneta was 9,357.\\n\nAbout a decade after its foundation, the town had a significant economic development led by agriculture and industry. By 1894, there were three sugarcane estates, 93 sugar mills, and the production of other fruits.  \\nBecause of its location next to the Río Grande de Manatí , Barceloneta was known for many years as a site of important port activity, for shipment of sugar and salt , as well as passengers to New York City and Barcelona . Bonocio\\'s son was the owner of a sail ship that made those routes.  \\n\nIn 1899, Barceloneta requested to be annexed to the town of Manatí . An election was scheduled for August 14, 1899 to decide the matter. However, on August 8, the island suffered the effects of Hurricane San Ciriaco , which prevented the elections from being held. The following year, Governor George Whitefield Davis ordered the annexation of Barceloneta into Manatí. The annexation was short-lived. Eleven years later, the government reinstated Barceloneta as a municipality.  \\n\nAfter Central Plazuela , a large sugar cane mill, closed in 1963, Barceloneta started reinforcing its agricultural economy with pineapples and other minor fruits. Efforts to revive the economy were not too successful, until pharmaceutical industries established themselves in the town during the 1970s.  For a time, Barceloneta supplied all of the Viagra for North America.  \\n\nHurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017 causing large-scale damage and destruction to infrastructure.   In Barceloneta, some homes and establishments along the coast were flooded with up to 15 feet of water, and nearly all wooden homes were destroyed.  \\n\nGeography\nThe Municipality of Barceloneta sits on the Northern Karst region of Puerto Rico, on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by the municipalities of Arecibo , Florida , and Manatí . In terms of physical features, the municipality occupies a roughly rectangular area in the northern coast of the island. It has a surface area of 36.4 square miles (94.24 km2).  \\n\nBarceloneta\\'s terrain is predominantly plain. Since it is located in the karst region, it features hills, ponors , and caves. Near the coast, the terrain is occupied by the Caño Tiburones wetlands.  \\n\nUpdated flood zone maps (as of 2019) show that Barceloneta is extremely vulnerable to flooding , along with Humacao , Rincón , Toa Baja , and Corozal . For its many wetlands, Barceloneta ends up being extremely vulnerable when hit by a major hurricane.  \\n\nThe Río Grande de Manatí travels across the municipalities of Manatí and Barceloneta and drains into the Atlantic Ocean . Barceloneta also features the Caño Tiburones , a natural reserve.    \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Barceloneta is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.    \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Barceloneta: Abra del Pimiento, Abra los Caballos, Cité Sector in Garrochales, Palenque, and Seboruco.  \\n\nTourism\nThere are six beaches in Barceloneta including a black sand beach called Machuca .  \\n\nBarceloneta has many places of interest.  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Barceloneta passport page lists Malecón de la Boca , Antiguo Hospital Bonocio Llenza Feliú , La Mirada del Taíno , Semilla (for agritourism ), and Playa Arena Negra , as places of interest.  \\n\nCulture\nBarceloneta celebrates its patron saint festival in mid-July, generally from Wednesday to Sunday.  The Fiestas Patronales de la Virgen del Carmen is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as Odilio González , La Sonora Ponceña , Pedro Capó , Andrés Jiménez , José Alberto \"El Canario\" and Tito Nieves .  \\n\nEconomy\nBarceloneta has the biggest pharmaceutical complex in the world (14 industries). These companies have chosen Barceloneta to establish their facilities for its underground water reservoirs. The water in Barceloneta requires very little treatment for use in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products.  \\n\nThe employment created by these companies, along with a well-developed plan for urban growth, has allowed Barceloneta to be more than simply a town where people go to work. Puerto Rico Premium Outlets , near the expressway , have made the town into a destination for shopping and consumerism and consequently a place for investment in food chains and entertainment. Increased employment opportunities have also caused an increase in population in Barceloneta and its surrounding municipalities. \\n\nBarceloneta is also known for its black sand beaches.  \\n\nDemographics\nGovernment\nBarceloneta is known for its political stability. Mayor Sol Luis Fontanes held the mayor\\'s seat for the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) from 1986 until 2012. He assumed the role after the sudden death of elected mayor Héctor Ruíz Martínez , also of the PPD. After that, Fontánes was elected by only a narrow margin (49.2% vs. 48.6%), but he gained popularity with time. At the 2008 general elections , Fontánes received more than 70% of the votes and his margin of victory was one of the biggest of that election.   However, on 2012, Fontánes was arrested on charges of extortion , after 24 years as mayor. He resigned on March 1, 2012 while in prison.  In 2012, Wanda Soler was elected as Fontánes replacement.  She was reelected in 2020 for her third term with 75% of the vote.   \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district III , which is represented by two senators. In 2008, José Emilio González and Angel Martínez were elected as district senators.  \\n\nNames and symbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag of Barceloneta is a variation of the flag of Barcelona in Spain , from where the town borrows its name. It features four fields, two of them bearing the cross of Saint George (in Catalan, Sant Jordi ), with five red and yellow bars in vertical direction to the right of each cross. These are all symbols pertaining to the city of Barcelona , and the community of Catalonia , where it is located, since the town was founded by a Catalan immigrant. The remaining two fields in the flag are blue, representing the Atlantic Ocean , which lies to the north of Barceloneta.     \\n\nBarceloneta\\'s coat of arms is similar to the flag, since it features the same Catalan symbols. However, it features three sugarcane flowers ( guajanas ) on top of the blue fields. The sugarcane flowers symbolize the source of life of the old agricultural economy of Barceloneta. The blue symbolizes the beaches and marine ports that contributed to the industry and commerce of the town. Like many coat of arms, it features a crown with three towers.  \\n\nBarceloneta is referred to as \"La Ciudad de las Piñas\" (Pineapple City) for its many pineapple plantations. It is also known as \"La Ciudad Industrial\" (Industrial City) for its many industries, mainly pharmaceutical .  \\n\nOther names are \"Ciudad de los Indios\" (City of the Indians) and \"Pueblo de Sixto Escobar \" (Town of Sixto Escobar) for being the birthplace of the Puerto Rican boxer. [ citation needed ] \\n\nEducation\nTransportation\nBarceloneta has recently added the use of trolley cars, free of charge, for local transport within the town itself. For travel outside Barceloneta, there is a station for carros publicos (public car transportation), which is a type of taxi.\\n\nThere are 9 bridges in Barceloneta.  \\n\nGallery\nPlaces in Barceloneta:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBarranquitas, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nBarranquitas  is a small mountain town and municipality located in the Cordillera Central region of Puerto Rico , south of Corozal and Naranjito ; north of Coamo and Aibonito ; west of Comerío and Cidra ; and east of Orocovis . Barranquitas is spread over 6 barrios and Barranquitas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nBarranquitas is about one hour by winding roads from San Juan , the capital. It is nestled amid hills and mountains, and nearby, between Barranquitas and Aibonito, is the San Cristóbal Canyon ; one of the deepest canyons in the West Indies . For years, the overlook was used as a municipal garbage; in the last decade, the refuse was removed and the site restored.\\n\nHistory\nBarranquitas\\'s local Taino Cacique was called Orocobix .\\n\nThe town was founded in 1803 by Antonio Aponte Ramos.  \\nEarly in the 20th century, Barranquitas residents, known as Barranquiteños , had a short but legendary territory war with residents of the city of Comerío .\\n\nIn 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Barranquitas was 8,103.\\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Barranquitas with its significant amount of rainfall and its nearly category 5 winds.   Many residents did not receive help for weeks after the hurricane made landfall as entry into the municipality was hampered by downed trees and telephone poles, landslides, and highways that had split in two.   \\n\nIn Barranquitas, up to 1000 homes, and its highways were destroyed by landslides. Forty days after the hurricane, none of Barranquitas\\' 29,000 residents had their electrical power restored. Barranquitas\\' agriculture industry was decimated with one farmer saying he\\'d lost his five thousand plantain trees, apio , and other minor crops.  \\n\nScenes around Barranquitas after Hurricane María:\\n\nGeography\nBarranquitas is a landlocked municipality in the middle of the Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico, the main mountain range that crosses the island from west to east. It is bordered by the municipalities of Corozal , Naranjito , Coamo , Aibonito , Orocovis , and Comerío . Barranquitas has a surface area of 34 square miles (88.4 km 2 ).  \\n\nThe terrain is mostly mountainous. Some of the peaks found in the municipality are La Torrecilla and Farallón. Barranquitas is also the site of the San Cristóbal Canyon and Las Bocas Canyon .  \\n\nRivers of Barranquitas include the Río de Barranquitas , Río Grande de Manatí , Piñonas, Río Hondo , and Río Usabón .\\n\nThere are 14 bridges in Barranquitas.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Barranquitas is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion .  A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Barranquitas: El Amparo neighborhood, Cañabón barrio, La Vega neighborhood, Calle Abajo (Calle Melitón Pérez), La Loma, La Torre, Los Pinos, Quebrada Grande barrio, and Tres Caminos.  \\n\nEnergy consortium\nAn Energy Consortium was signed in late February 2019, by Villalba , Orocovis , Morovis , Ciales and Barranquitas municipalities. The consortium is the first of its kind on the commonwealth and intends to have these municipalities work together, to safeguard their communities, in the event of a catastrophe, by creating resilient, and efficient energy networks with backups.  \\n\nTourism\nBarranquitas is the burial place of two prominent Puerto Rican politicians; Luis Muñoz Rivera (who was born in the town) and his son, Governor Luis Muñoz Marín (who was born in San Juan ). This has made Barranquitas a popular tourist attraction among Puerto Ricans. The birthplace of Muñoz Rivera has been converted into a museum . The mausoleum of the Muñoz Rivera family is a place of interest. Among those buried there are Muñoz Rivera and his son and daughter-in-law, Luis Muñoz Marín, and his second wife Inés Mendoza de Muñoz.\\n\nOther known places of interest in Barranquitas are the San Cristóbal Canyon , Las Bocas Canyon , and the ruins of Hacienda Margarita. El Cortijo Castle is an old, historical structure, which is currently a museum. Camp Morton ( Campamento Morton ) is a popular spot for activities and retreats.\\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Barranquitas passport page lists Cañon de San Cristobal , Plaza Bicentenaria , Museo de la Familia Muñoz Rivera , and the Feria de Artesanías , as places of interest.  \\n\nCulture\nBarranquitas celebrates its patron saint festival in June. The Fiestas Patronales de San Antonio de Padua is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Barranquitas include:\\n\nBarranquitas doesn\\'t have professional sports teams, but there are some amateur sports teams based in the city.

The team of Barranquitas is known as the \"Proceres\" (is an adjective for an important person in history) due to the fact that the town has been the birthplace for many historical figures. The other popular sport is volleyball.\\n\nEconomy\nSome of the crops grown in Barranquitas include plantain, coffee , lemon , ají dulce , yam , and other fruits and vegetables. The main crop in Barranquitas is the apio . The apio is a root vegetable (from the legume Apios tuberosa / Apios Americana ), and it is eaten like potatoes (not to be confused with celeriac).   \\n\nFootwear and clothing is manufactured in Barranquitas.\\n\nDemographics\nIn 2020, the population of Barranquitas was 28,983 with 99.9% self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino, the highest of all Puerto Rico\\'s municipalities.  \\n\nMany of the Puerto Ricans born in the town are known to have light-colored eyes and have strong European features . Some also have a mestizo look. [ citation needed ] The Taíno and European immigrants intermarried and created what is called mestizo.  The reason for this was the migration of many Taíno Indians during the Spanish colonization . Taínos often fled to the mountainous region to escape slavery. Many Spanish and other European immigrants moved to this region and settled as coffee growers. [ citation needed ] \\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor , elected every four years. The current mayor of Barranquitas is Elliot Colon Blanco , of the New Progressive Party (PNP). He was elected at the 2018 primaries and the re-elected on General Elections of 2020.\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VI , which is represented by two senators.\\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag of the municipality consists of three horizontal stripes; white on the upper edge representing the silver enamel of the town\\'s shield, green in the center representing the vegetation and yellow on the lower edge representing the gold enamel of the ravines of the San Cristóbal Canyon .  \\n\nThe coat of arms of Barranquitas has silver, a canyon, two ravines, gold slopes, a tree, gold leaves, a bell and a crown. The ravines are reminders of the San Cristóbal Canyon, located in the territorial boundary of Barranquitas and Aibonito , a neighboring municipality. The yagrumo trees are characteristic of the high mountainous areas of Puerto Rico and symbolize the elevation of Barranquitas.  \\n\nEducation\nThe Interamerican University of Puerto Rico has a campus in Barranquitas.  \\n\nAll public schools in Puerto Rico are administered by the Puerto Rico Department of Education .

        "page_content": "Contents\nBayamón, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nBayamón  is a city , municipality of Puerto Rico and suburb of San Juan located in the northern coastal valley, north of Aguas Buenas and Comerío ; south of Toa Baja and Cataño ; west of Guaynabo ; and east of Toa Alta and Naranjito . Bayamón is spread over 11 barrios and Bayamón Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area and the second most populous municipality in both the metropolitan area and Puerto Rico.\\n\nHistory\nThe Taíno people , the indigenous peoples who encountered European explorers and settlers, were the long-time settlers in this area. The Spanish colonist Juan Ramírez de Arellano established Bayamón as a Spanish settlement on May 22, 1772. Two theories exist about the origin of the name Bayamón. According to one, it was named after the local Taíno chief, Bahamon . The other theory states the name was derived from the Taíno word Bayamongo , which is the native name of the river that runs across this region, implying that Bayamón is the area around this main river, which later on became the center of the city\\'s development.\\n\nIn 1821, Marcos Xiorro , an African slave , planned to lead a revolt against the sugarcane plantation owners and the Spanish colonial government in Puerto Rico. The slave conspiracy was revealed and suppressed, but Xiorro became a hero among the slaves. He is part of Puerto Rico\\'s folklore. Marco Xiorro was owned by Vicente Andino, a militia captain who owned a sugarcane plantation in Bayamón.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Bayamón was 19,940.  The city grew considerably during the start of the 20th century. The area became home to numerous factories specializing in textiles, fertilizer, aluminum between 1901 and 1920. During this time the city also became home to financial institutions such as the Puerto Rico Commercial Bank (Banco Comercial de Puerto Rico), the American Colonial Bank, the First National City Bank of New York , the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico . This developed and strengthened Bayamón\\'s economy and turned it into both an industrial and commercial hub. The city\\'s infrastructure also developed with the establishment of a bigger sewer system.  \\n\nThe city was also host to some of the events of the VIII Pan American Games in 1979.\\n\nHurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing large-scale damage and destruction to infrastructure. Numerous landslides occurred in Bayamón as a result of the hurricane\\'s significant amount of rainfall.   In Bayamón, around 300 homes were destroyed, and two people were killed by Hurricane María. Many municipal buildings, and the Goya Foods factory in Bayamón sustained significant damage.  \\n\nGeography\nBayamón lies in the Northern Coastal Plain region of Puerto Rico. It is bordered by the municipalities of Toa Baja , Cataño , Comerío , Aguas Buenas , Toa Alta , Naranjito , and Guaynabo . Bayamón has a surface area of 43.5 square miles (113.1 km2). The terrain is mostly flat, but it does include some large hills such as La Peña and Vergaras.  \\n\nBayamón is Puerto Rico\\'s second-most populous municipality and is part of the large metropolitan area centered around San Juan . Other cities included in the metropolitan area are Guaynabo , Cataño , Toa Baja , Canóvanas , Carolina and Trujillo Alto . Bayamón is served by the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport .

The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Bayamón: Abra Estrecha, Barriada Vista Alegre, Juan Sánchez, Nuevo, Bda.

It is a science-themed park with various exhibitions and attractions. It is located in the middle of karstic hills. An observation building on one of the hills provides a good view of the metropolitan area. The building hosts antennas for government and civil communication.\\n\nEl parque del tren was a park featuring what was then Puerto Rico \\'s only working train. It featured a DC-3 , which had been used by United Airlines . In 2001, the park was dismantled and destroyed in the course of major road construction. What is left of the park is a small plaza for activities and an area for jogging and passive entertainment. The area is now known as \"Parque del Nino\" or \"Children\\'s Park\".\\n\nShopping is a major tourist activity in Bayamón. Plaza del Sol and Plaza Rio Hondo are large commercial centers in the city.\\n\nA suspension bridge in Bayamón is a pedestrian-only bridge, at the time it was built, it was believed to be one of only three of its kind in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Bayamón passport page lists Centro de Conservación de Manatíes , Paseo Lineal over the Bayamón River, and Ron Del Barrilito in the Hacienda Santa Ana , as places of interest.  \\n\nRon del Barrilito located in the Hacienda Santa Ana is the oldest rum distillery in Puerto Rico.

León and maintains the design and colors of its coat of arms.\\n\nThis shield is a symbol and synthesis of the history and the values which distinguish the city of Bayamón. The main colors of the shield are blue and silver, representing the waters of the Bayamón River and recalling that it was on these banks that the first hydraulic sugarcane refinery of Puerto Rico was established in 1549. The center contains the Holy Cross (Santa Cruz), patron of the first church of the municipality and the name of the old sugarcane refinery \"Santa Cruz\", which was the historical origin of the town of Bayamón. The sugarcane flowers ( guajana ) allude directly to the sugarcane industry that is of social and economic importance to the origin and development of Bayamón.  \\n\nThe five-tower crown, which is used for cities, was assigned to Bayamón as an exception for its extraordinary urban development, the magnitude of its population and for its religious dignity, which will possibly be raised to become Episcopal seat.

        "page_content": "Contents\nCabo Rojo, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nCabo Rojo  is a city and municipality situated on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico and forms part of the San Germán-Cabo Rojo metropolitan area as well as the larger Mayagüez-San Germán-Cabo Rojo Combined Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nThe area near Las Salinas (salt flats) has been inhabited since 30 BC and AD 120 according to archaeological evidence. Punta Ostiones , listed in the National Register of Historic Places as an archeological site, was home to a large group of Archaic Indians .  \\n\nDespite the threat of pirates and natives, the Spanish settled the area of Los Morrillos around 1511. By 1525, salt mining was an important industry in the area. In 1759 the first request to establish itself as a town was denied. Cabo Rojo was founded on December 17, 1771, by Nicolás Ramírez de Arellano,  a descendant of Spanish nobility, with the approval of Governor and Captain General Miguel de Muesas. According to Fray Iñigo Abbad y Lasierra by the end of the 18th century, [ citation needed ] Cabo Rojo had a population of 1,215 people. [ when? ] \\n\nCabo Rojo ( red cape in English) derives its name from both the reddish color of its salt-flats and the reddish tint that characterizes the seaside cliffs along its southern coast. According to legend, the name was given by Christopher Columbus himself. The first church, founded in 1783, was called San José . The present-day main Catholic church is called San Miguel Arcángel Church located in the town\\'s square.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . On October 18, 1898, formal possession of the island was assumed and the American flag raised over the fortifications from which the emblem of Spain had flown for nearly four centuries.\\n\nHurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing large-scale damage and destruction to infrastructure.   In Cabo Rojo, around 400 homes lost their roof, and three thousand residents were left without drinking water as a result of Hurricane María. The coastal fishing village of Joyuda was the most impacted area of Cabo Rojo.  \\n\nGeography\nThe municipality of Cabo Rojo lies on the southern-west corner of the island of Puerto Rico , on the Western Coastal Plains. Sierra Bermeja , Puerto Rico\\'s geologically oldest mountain range, crosses the municipality from west to east towards Lajas . It is bordered by Mayagüez and Hormigueros to the north, San Germán and Lajas to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the south and the Mona Passage to the west. Cabo Rojo has a surface area of 72 square miles (187 km 2 ).  \\n\nCabo Rojo\\'s terrain is flat, however, some notable peaks are Mariquita, Buena Vista, Cerro Vargas, and Peñones de Melones.\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Cabo Rojo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.   Cabo Rojo is a principal municipality of the San Germán-Cabo Rojo metropolitan area as well as the larger Mayagüez-San Germán-Cabo Rojo Combined Statistical Area .\\n\nPeople from the El Combate community in barrio Boquerón are known as mata con hacha (\"those who kill with axes\") based on an old folk tale about a fight over the salinas , where those from Cabo Rojo fought with axes against people from the adjacent town of Lajas . The latter apparently fought back by throwing stones and are thus known as tira piedras (\"those who throw stones\").  \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Cabo Rojo: Ballajá, Colacho, El Fuego y Las Piedras (Guaniquilla), Hoyo Bravo, Las Quebradas en Monte Grande, Pedernales, Puerto Real, and Sector Corozo.  \\n\nClimate\nDemographics\nIn 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Cabo Rojo was 16,154.  \\n \\n\nTourism\nThere are 127 beaches in Cabo Rojo, including Playa Sucia .  \\n\nIts tourism industry has flourished with the development of hotels and marinas, but local and international environmentalists are concerned that this development will endanger Cabo Rojo\\'s rich and beautiful beaches, sunsets and natural resources. Cabo Rojo is also well known for its fishing, particularly the Puerto Real fishing village, and its many seafood restaurants, most of which are found in the fishing village of Joyuda .\\n\nThe San Miguel Arcángel Church , in the main town square, was built between 1773 and 1783. The famous Cabo Rojo lighthouse, Los Morrillos Lighthouse , known by locals as El Faro , was built in 1881 over limestone cliffs that rise 200 feet above sea level. This old lighthouse was automated and electrically charged in 1967 and is considered to have some, if not, the most spectacular ocean views on Puerto Rico\\'s west coast. The lighthouse has undergone recent renovations which has created controversy because of the quality of the work. According to locals and scholars, the internal structure was gutted leaving nothing of historical significance behind.\\n\nThe lighthouse is located near the Salinas , or salt mines . These salt mines are reported to be the oldest industry in the New World . Salt has been mined in this site non-stop since the time of the Taínos . Near the Salinas , a local civic group Caborrojeños Pro Salud y Ambiente run a visitor center known as the Centro Interpretativo Las Salinas De Cabo Rojo don Efrén Pérez Rivera . They offer free guided tours of the local area, which is rich in flora and fauna.\\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Cabo Rojo passport page lists Faro Los Morrillos , Puente de Piedra , Centro Interpretativo Las Salinas , Hacienda Verde Tahiti (for agritourism ), and several beaches including Playuela, Buyé, El Combate, and Boquerón , as places of interest.  \\n\nNational protected areas\nCulture\nCabo Rojo celebrates its patron saint festival in September. The Fiestas Patronales de San Miguel Arcangel is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico , Plena Libre , Kany García , and Cano Estremera .  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Cabo Rojo include:\\n\nCabo Rojo had a BSN basketball team, Los Turistas de Cabo Rojo (the \"Cabo Rojo Tourists\") from 1989 to 1993.\\n\nIndias de Mayagüez , female Volleyball team from Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino played the 2009 season at the Coliseo Rebekah Colberg Cabrera , because their home ground, Palacios de los Deportes , was under remodeling.  \\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years. The current mayor of Cabo Rojo is Jorge Morales Wiscovitch, who beat incumbent Bobby Ramírez Kurtz at the 2020 general election .  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district IV , which is represented by two Senators, and the Puerto Rico Representative District 20 , which has one representative. In 2020, Ada García Montes and Migdalia González were elected as District Senators, while Kebin Andrés Maldonado Martiz was elected the District Representative.   \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag contains elements of the coat of arms, excluding the sword, the anchors and the crown.  \\n\nThe point or red triangle symbolizes the \"Cabo Bermejo \" (Vermillion Cape) in Los Morrillos. The blue and white, with the anchors, represent the sea that \"bathes our coasts\". The flaming sword, is an attribute to Archangel Saint Michael , the town\\'s patron saint. Finally, the crown, which heightens and distinguishes the shield, stands for the status of Cabo Rojo.  \\n\nThe anthem of Cabo Rojo is a composition with music and lyrics by Carlos Weber Asencio.\\n\nTransportation\nAlthough Cabo Rojo lacks an airport, it is approximately 11 miles from the Eugenio María de Hostos Airport (MAZ) in Mayagüez , a commercial airport that serves direct flights to and from San Juan . Cabo Rojo has grown tremendously in the last few years as evidenced by its accreditation as a city. Cabo Rojo\\'s nearest airport servicing international destinations is forty-five minutes away in Aguadilla\\'s Rafael Hernández Airport (BQN). This airport was part of the now deactivated Ramey Air Force Base .\\n\nPR-100 is the main highway in the city, connecting northward to PR-2 between Hormigueros and Mayagüez , and southward to the Boquerón sector. Other mayor roads include PR-101 , which connects to Lajas, PR-102 , connecting to Mayagüez and San Germán , PR-103 , an older road which parallels the newer PR-100 , and PR-301 , connecting to El Combate sector and the Los Morrillos Lighthouse .\\n\nThere are 20 bridges in Cabo Rojo.  \\n\nNotable people\nThe following is a list of notable Caborrojeños:\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCaguas, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nCaguas  is a city and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Central Mountain Range of Puerto Rico , south of San Juan and Trujillo Alto , west of Gurabo and San Lorenzo , and east of Aguas Buenas , Cidra , and Cayey . Caguas was founded in 1775. The municipality had a population of 127,244 at the 2020 census .  \\n\nCaguas is located 20 miles (32 km) from San Juan . It is located in the Valle de Caguas or Caguas Valley (also known as Valle del Turabo or the Turabo Valley), at the eastern ranges of the Central Mountain Range . It is known as La Ciudad Criolla ( Criollo City), Valle del Turabo (the Turabo Valley) and La Cuna de los Trovadores (The Cradle of the Trovadores ).  Its name originates from the Taíno cacique Caguax , who was a regional chief. Caguas is a principal city of both the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area and the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area .  \\n\nSince 2009 Caguas is the only municipality in Puerto Rico recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation .  \\n\nHistory\n\\nThe area of the Valley of Caguas was first settled by the Saladoid culture , an Arawak culture which originated in northern South America (today Venezuela ), approximately between the years 100 BCE to 600 CE. Findings from the Cagüitas archaeological site (CS-2) indicate that the area was later inhabited by various pre- Taíno (Ostionoid) cultures which first developed agriculture in the valley, primarily the cultivation of cassava , and hunted now extinct species such as hutias . As with the rest of Puerto Rico, the Taínos were the primary group living in the valley at the time of the Spanish arrival . The Spanish conquistadors further developed the agriculture in the valley, while also establishing mines in search of gold , silver and copper . Most of the native Taínos living in the area were either forced out or taken as slaves and moved to the Real Hacienda del Toa (in modern-day Toa Alta and Toa Baja ). Most of the valley was later cleared of its original vegetation for the development of cattle farms such as Hato de Bairoa , Hato de Caguax and Hato de Gurabo . \nCaguas was officially founded on January 1, 1775, as San Sebastián del Piñal de Caguax , with the name later being shortened and modernized to its current form. The name of the city comes from Caguax , a local Taíno chief and early convert to Christianity . The site of the historic downtown area of Caguas and its central square dates to 1779. In 1820 the settlement was granted the title of Villa and it was granted city rights in 1894. Sugarcane was the primary crop during this time and important sugarcane plantations and refineries were those of Central Santa Juana (close to modern day Plaza Centro ) and Central Santa Catalina (modern day Las Catalinas Mall ). The Carretera Central , which is the first paved road to cross Puerto Rico from north to south connecting San Juan to Ponce , was built during the last two decades of the 19th century,  made Caguas more accessible therefore causing the population of the town to grow even more.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Caguas was 19,857.  \\n\nThe city grew considerably in size during the 1970s  and quickly became an exurb of San Juan to the north due to its location. The region of Caguas became an important pharmaceuticals manufacturing center during this time. Pharmaceutical companies originally came to Puerto Rico in the late 1960s and 1970s to take advantage of the now-expired federal tax incentive known as Section 936 . This incentive allowed U.S.-based manufacturers to send all profits from local plants to stateside parent plants without having to pay any federal taxes.  \\n\nAlthough not typically seen as part of the colloquial \\xc3\\x81rea Metro of San Juan ( San Juan , Cataño , Bayamón , Guaynabo and Carolina ), the municipality of Caguas is located in the census-based San Juan Metropolitan Area due to its role as a commuter town . The average commute time for residents of the municipality is 30.5 minutes.  Caguas is the fourth most populous city in the San Juan Metropolitan region and the most populous city in Puerto Rico that is not located in a coastal area.\\n\nOn August 7, 2002, Caguas was the site of the 2002 USAF Hercules air disaster , where all 10 military personnel on board lost their lives after an airplane carrying them struck a mountain in the south of the municipality.  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Caguas with its wind and rain. Rivers were breached causing flooding of low-lying areas, and infrastructure and homes were destroyed. The hurricane caused $90 million in damages in Caguas.    More specifically, 40 homes were left without a roof and 30 were flooded in the Morales neighborhood. Escuela Segunda Unidad Diego Vázquez and the Centro Multiusos flooded as well.  \\n\nGeography\nThe city and municipality of Caguas are located approximately 30 minutes from the coastline both on the east ( Humacao ) and the north ( San Juan ). It is east of Aguas Buenas and Cidra , north of Cayey , south of San Juan , and west of Gurabo and Trujillo Alto . It also shares borders with Guayama and Patillas via a five-point border at the summit of Cerro La Santa , with Cayey and San Lorenzo . This is the tallest point of the Sierra de Cayey , not to be confused with Montaña Santa (officially called Cerro de Nuestra Madre) which is another mountain in the same massif located on the boundary between the municipalities of Patillas and San Lorenzo. At this point there are two tall antennas which provide signal to Puerto Rico\\'s principal TV stations such as WKAQ-TV and WAPA-TV . No road passes exactly at this point, and it can be approached nearby through Puerto Rico Highway 184 .\\n\nThe city is located in one of the largest valleys in Puerto Rico, the Valle de Caguas or Caguas Valley (also known as Valle del Turabo or the Turabo Valley).  Being located in a valley, Caguas has the distinction of being relatively flat except near the borders with all the mentioned municipalities except Gurabo.  The valley is bordered by the Altos de La Mesa and San Luis ranges in the north, the Sierra de Luquillo on the northeast, the San Lorenzo batholith to the east, the Sierra de Cayey on the south and the main range of the Cordillera Central to the west.\\n\nThis valley is fed mainly by the Grande de Loíza River , one of Puerto Rico\\'s major rivers that feed into the Atlantic Ocean , and numerous tributaries such as the Cagüitas , along which the contemporary settlement of Caguas was built. The city\\'s nickname Valle del Turabo comes from the Turabo River , which is another tributary that flows from the south. The Gurabo River , another major tributary, feeds into the Grande de Loíza at a region where the valley narrows into a rift valley that runs from west to east and ends in Humacao in the southeastern coast of the island.\\n\nAs with other parts of Puerto Rico, the region of Caguas is susceptible to earthquakes. The municipality is located along the Great Northern Puerto Rico fault zone (GNPRfz) and in recent times the region experienced moderate size earthquakes in 1990  and 2010 .  \\n\nThe climate is classified as a tropical monsoon climate , meaning the daily mean temperature from month to month is never less than 64.4 °F (18.0 °C), and there is a distinct wet and dry season. Rainfall is common in relative abundance throughout most of the year, although there is less rain than in the eastern coastal valleys. The land, however, is fertile and deep.\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Caguas is subdivided into barrios :    \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,    are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Caguas: Bairoa La 25, Morales neighborhood, Parcelas Viejas in Borinquén, Sector La Barra, and Comunidad La Quebrada in Río Cañas, Hoyo Frío in Las Carolinas, Lajitas, Las Carolinas, Los Muchos, Los Panes in Beatriz, and Savarona.   \\n\nTourism\nThere are seven places in Caguas listed on the US National Register of Historic Places :  \\n\nOther landscapes, landmarks and tourist attractions in Caguas include:\\n\nThe municipality of Caguas is home to various parks and natural protected areas managed by different governmental entities ranging from the municipal government, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources , the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust , and the United States Fish & Wildlife Service .  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Caguas passport page lists the Jardín Botánico William Miranda Marin , the Catedral Dulce Nombre de Jesús , the Plaza de Recreo Santiago R. Palmer and the Museo de Artes Populares as places of interest.  \\n\nCulture\nCaguas celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Sra. del Carmen is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events include:\\n\nThe Criollos de Caguas baseball team is considered one of the greatest of all time in all of Latin America, having won 18 national Puerto Rico titles and 5 Caribbean World Series titles The team is a member of the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico ( LBPPR ). Three of the first five Puerto Ricans that played Major League Baseball in the U.S. mainland, at one point in their careers played for the Criollos de Caguas ( Luis Rodríguez Olmo , Victor Pellot Power , Roberto Clemente ).\\n\nThe Criollos de Caguas basketball team, founded in 1968 by Dr. Héctor \"Tato\" Dávila and Lcdo. Libertario Pérez Rodríguez (a lawyer), is a basketball team that did not enjoy as much success as their baseball counterparts. However, in the early 2000s, they showed a lot of progress by reaching the national playoffs various times. The team was a member of the BSN . In 2006, the team won its first BSN national basketball championship, defeating Flor Melendez and his Santurce Crabbers in five games.\\n\nCaguas is home to the Bairoa Gym , one of the most important boxing gyms in all Puerto Rico and a place where many local and visiting champions and otherwise notable boxers have trained at; such as boxing Welterweight Champion Miguel Cotto , his brother Jose Miguel , Alberto Mercado , Juan Carazo , Alfredo Escalera and others.\\n\nThe Criollas de Caguas women\\'s volleyball team has won 9 national Puerto Rico titles and has made it to the finals more than 15 times. The team is a member of the Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino (LVSF).\\n\nThe Criollos de Caguas FC soccer team is considered one of the most successful clubs in the island winning multiple tournaments and cups in Puerto Rican soccer including the National League Title in 2015.\\n\nEconomy\nIn September 2005, city mayor William Miranda Marín levied the first municipal tax in Puerto Rico via city ordinance. Area merchants now charge a one cent tax for every dollar spent at all retail businesses. The tax has become known around the island as the \" Willie Tax .\" It resulted in an estimated $500,000 monthly income for the city. However, the municipal tax was increased to 1.5% after the establishment of the 5.5% state tax, for a total of 7%, and the tax was declared illegal by the Puerto Rico\\'s Supreme Court. [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn 2006, Miranda Marín began calling Caguas \"El Nuevo País de Caguas\" (\"The New Country of Caguas\").\\n\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, Caguas hosted one of Puerto Rico\\'s most important sugar manufacturers, which gave employment to thousands of Cagüeños.\\n\nNumerous businesses and important buildings have opened in Caguas since the 1970s, including the imposing 23 story apartment building Caguas Tower , its adjacent competitors Bonneville Apartments, and the 10 floor Menonita Hospital .  There are also several shopping centers:\\n\nDemographics\nIn 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Caguas was 19,857.\\n\nIn 2020, Caguas had a population of 127,244 compared to 142,893 in 2010. This shows an 11% decrease in the population in the municipality. The population density in 2020 was 2,200 people per square mile (850 people/km 2 ). Hispanic or Latino of any race constitute 98.4% of the population of the municipality. There are also communities of Dominicans , Cubans and Colombians .\\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor , elected every four years. The mayor of the city of Caguas were\\n\n1953 to 1969 - Angel Rivera PPD \\n\n1969 to 1973 - Miguel Hernandez Rodriguez (New Progressive Party (PNP))\\n\n1973 to 1977 - Angel O. Berrios Diaz (PPD)\\n\n1977 to 1981 - Miguel Hernandez Rodriguez (PNP)\\n\n1981 to 1997 - Angel O. Berrios Diaz (PPD)\\n\n1997 to 2010 - William Miranda Marín (PPD)\\n\n2010 to present - William Miranda Torres (PPD)\\n\nThe city belongs to the Senatorial district VII (Humacao), which is represented by two Senators. In 2016, Miguel Laureano (PNP) and José Luis Dalmau (PPD) were elected as District Senators.\\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio or municipality has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe colors blue and gold were chosen for the shield, distinctive of the city of Caguas. The figures symbolize both the indigenous and Christian origins of the city.\\n\nThe coat of arms consists of a shield with a blue field. Upon the field are two sets of three golden arrows, forming a cross of St. Andrew . Above the cross is a crown which represents Caguax , cacique of the Turabo Valley region at the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquerors. Arrows were used as a remembrance of the first Christian place of worship established in the region which was dedicated under the patronage of St. Sebastian . There are pineapples interspersed to reflect the native agriculture. A castellated wall surmounts the shield to show the city\\'s having been granted status as a municipality by the Spanish Crown .\\n\nOn the flag, the shield sits atop another blue field on which the cross of arrows motif is repeated.  \\n\nTransportation\nPublic transportation in Caguas, as in most of Puerto Rico, is limited to small \"guaguas públicas\" (Mini Bus) . There is inexpensive but slow service to and from San Juan and Rio Piedras . Several buses and public taxi services serve the town to a limited degree. In 2019,  91.55% of the population relied on their own cars or carpool services to commute.\\n\nA \" light interurban rail \" system connecting Caguas to San Juan was in the planning stages and discarded due to lack of funding.\\n\nCaguas is served by one freeway, one tolled expressway and one main divided highway. Puerto Rico Highway 30 connects Caguas to the eastern part of the island. There is no freeway/expressway to the west, due mainly to the fact that there is no sufficient population west of Caguas to develop a new freeway or expressway; good access to the municipalities of Cidra (southwest) and Aguas Buenas (northwest) are possible via PR-172 and PR-156 , respectively. Puerto Rico Highway 52 connects Caguas to the north ( San Juan ) and south ( Cayey , Ponce ). Puerto Rico Highway 1 is an alternate route to San Juan and Guaynabo with two lanes per direction; in south Caguas it becomes rural near Borinquen , therefore the only good access to Cayey is the expressway ( PR-52 ) and a $1.00 toll has to be paid (only in the south direction). The only municipality bordering Caguas with a poor-access road is San Lorenzo , via PR-183 ; but good access to San Lorenzo is possible by entering Gurabo via PR-30 , and then taking PR-203 south. Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport is about 35 minutes away by car.\\n\nThere are 86 bridges in Caguas.  \\n\nEducation\nAcademia Adventista Caguas\\n\nHealth care\nSister cities\nCaguas, Puerto Rico is twinned with Hartford, Connecticut and Southbridge, Massachusetts .\\n\nNotable People\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCamuy, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nCamuy  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico , bordering the Atlantic Ocean , north of Lares and San Sebastián ; east of Quebradillas ; and west of Hatillo . Camuy is spread over 12 barrios and Camuy Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). The town celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2007.\\n\nCamuy is part of the \"Porta Atlántico\" Tourist Area.\\n\nHistory\nCamuy , popularly known as Romantic City ( la ciudad romántica ), was founded in 1807 by Petronila Matos, and formerly part of Arecibo is located in the northwestern coastal region of Puerto Rico, less than 5 minutes west of Hatillo municipality, on PR-2 and PR-119 . As early as 1846, Puente Camuy , a bridge over the Camuy River linked Camuy with Hatillo.  The name Camuy derives from the Taíno language , although a number of legends give differing explanations for the origin of the name. One such legend claims the name comes from the Taíno word for \"sun\", another claims derivation from camuy , Taíno for \"beautiful scenery\", and still another states that Camuy was the name of the Taíno chief Yumac with the letters in reverse order. The \"sun\" legend is reflected in the coat of arms for the municipality.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Camuy was 10,887.  \\n\nIn its beginnings Camuy was integrated into the Partition of San Antonio de la Tuna. The \"partitions\" were great expanses of land that divided Puerto Rico. This region today is known as Isabela, Puerto Rico . At the time the partition covered the areas between Aguadilla and Arecibo , what is known today as the municipalities of Camuy, Hatillo, Quebradillas , Isabela , Utuado , and San Sebastián .\\n\nThe population of Camuy was 35,159 at the 2010 census , and it has land area of 46.3 square miles (120 km 2 ). The municipality is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo metropolitan area and is a popular suburb . It was named in 2015 by the U.S. Conference of Mayors as one of the most livable cities in the United States.  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Camuy with the significant amount of rainfall.   Electricity was restored to the town center on October 4.  However, rural areas remained without electricity until March 2018. There were catastrophic damages in Camuy with around 2000 residences damaged or completely destroyed. The hospital\\'s roof was torn off. The 40 animal husbandry businesses in Camuy, agriculture, and tourism industries suffered heavy losses. One of the main tourist attractions in Puerto Rico located in Camuy, Parque Nacional de las Cavernas del Río Camuy was destroyed,  and would remain closed for four years.  \\n\nGeography\nCamuy belongs to the zone designated as the plateau of the northwest where the terrain is level and known as the Valley of Quebradillas. It is located in the Northern Karst zone of Puerto Rico. In the interior of the municipality the topography becomes very irregular near Cibao . This strip of land, a zone of wooded hills and depressions, divides Camuy completely into two strips, north and south. The northern strip is known as Lomas de los Puertos.  \\n\n\\nThe Camuy River forms part of the hydrographic system with a length of 24 miles, which at one point becomes a narrow canyon that forms one of the most beautiful cave systems in the world: the Rio Camuy Caverns , first explored in 1958. The Camuy River along with the Caverns are the 3rd largest and longest underground system in the world and the river is one of the few remaining active underground rivers in the Americas, stretching for miles. The Cibao River also forms part of the system.\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Camuy is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.    \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Camuy: Comunidad Puertos, Pueblo Norte (Calle Estrella), Pueblo Nuevo, Puente Peña (Maracayo) , and Puente Pica .   \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nCamuy is known for its Parque de las Cavernas del Río Camuy (Camuy River Cave Park), a large network of natural limestone caves and underground waterways shared with nearby municipalities of Hatillo and Lares . The cave system was first documented in the 1973 book Discovery At The Rio Camuy ( ISBN 0-517-50594-0 ) by Russell and Jeanne Gurnee. The park built around the cave system features tours of some of the caves, and is one of the most popular natural attractions in Puerto Rico. The caverns were created by the Río Camuy ( Camuy River ), the third longest underground river in the world.   In recognition of this, the Camuy coat of arms includes a symbol for the underground river.\\n\nThere are 9 beaches in Camuy, including Peñón Brussi .  \\n\nOther places of interest of Camuy include:  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turisteando (I\\'m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Camuy passport page lists Iglesia de Piedra , Balneario Peñon Brusi , and Parque de Las Cavernas del Río Camuy , as places of interest.  \\n\nCulture\nCamuy is first and foremost Catholic but there are other religions present in the town, including Protestant denominations such as the Pentecostals , Presbyterians , Methodists , and others. There are four Roman Catholic parishes in Camuy:\\n\nThe town has many local sports teams (volleyball, basketball, martial arts, swimming etc.) but most notably are their baseball teams. Many of them are part of the little league and the intermediate system but at the top the two professional Class A and Double AA baseball teams called \"Los Arenosos\" (Referring to the abundance of sand from the coastline).\\n\nThe patron saint of Camuy is Saint Joseph . His day is celebrated on March 1. The patron saint festivities (Fiestas Patronales) are celebrated every year around the last 2 weeks of the month of March, the month of Saint Joseph. His official liturgical day is March 1. Other festivals and celebrations that take place in Camuy include:  \\n\nEconomy\nAgriculture ( sugarcane some time ago) and cattle and milk production.  \\n\nThere\\'s an active manufacturing industry in the city, including companies such as Alaska based Cazador Apparel, Seamless Textiles, Hanes , Best Quality Coop and Camuy Furniture Warehouse. SNC Technical Services is another textile manufacturer in Camuy which picked up production in 2019.  \\n\nIn terms of commercial development, several fast foods franchises, banks and stores can be found in Camuy. Two strip malls are also planned to be constructed in the city.\\n\nTourism plays an important role in Camuy\\'s economy due in part to the Rio Camuy Caves , and Camuy\\'s public beaches.  \\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor , elected every four years. The current mayor of Camuy is Gabriel Hernández Rodríguez, of the New Progressive Party (PNP).  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district III , which is represented by two Senators. In 2008, José Emilio González Velázquez and Angel Martínez Santiago were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nTransportation\nIn 2019, there were 4 bridges in Camuy.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag is green like the coat of arms. A white undulating band runs horizontally across and is interrupted in the middle by the figure of the Camuy sun, in this case represented by the colors yellow and black.   \\n\nThe silver-waving stripe symbolizes the Camuy River (interrupted in the center because the river goes underground for part of its trajectory). The three tower crown distinguishes Camuy as a municipality.   \\n\nEducation\nCamuy currently has 17 public schools  and a community college.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCanóvanas, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nCanóvanas  is a town and municipality in Puerto Rico , located in the northeastern region, north of Juncos and Las Piedras ; south of Loíza ; east of Carolina ; and west of Río Grande . Canóvanas is spread over 6 barrios and Canóvanas Pueblo (the downtown area and administrative center). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nThe region of what is now Canóvanas belonged to the Taíno region of Cayniabón , also the native name of the Grande de Loiza River , which stretched from the central eastern region of Puerto Rico to the northeast coast of the island.  The region was led by cacique Canobaná , from which the actual name is derived, in the south half, and female Cacica Loaiza in the north (mostly modern day Loíza ). During the Spanish colonization , the region of Canóvanas was granted to Miguel Díaz, who turned the Taíno yucayeque into a ranch. It is said that Canóbana, along with Loaiza, were supporters of the Spanish regime and did not join the Taino rebellion of 1511 .  \\n\nCanóvanas was a barrio (district) of the municipality of Loíza for over 400 years. In 1902, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a law for the consolidation of certain municipalities. As a result, both Canóvanas and Loíza were incorporated into the municipality of Río Grande . However, in 1905 a new law revoked the previous one, returning Canóvanas to its previous state of barrio of Loíza.  \\n\nIn 1909, the Municipal administration of Loíza was transferred to the barrio of Canóvanas, which was more developed than the Loíza region. Also, the construction of the PR-3 facilitated the communication with Canóvanas. As a result of the transfer, land was acquired to build a new city hall , a town square, a slaughterhouse , and a cemetery. A 20-acre (8.1 ha) plot of land was purchased by Don Luis Hernaiz Veronne, a townhall senator and local farmer. The site location was strategic, to intercept traffic from the PR-3 , and from other nearby roads like the PR-185 .\\n\nHowever, the transfer was not well received by the residents of the original town of Loíza, then renamed Loiza Aldea . It was not until a law was passed on June 30, 1969, that both municipalities were recognized as having \"clearly different population nuclei\" recommending the establishment of two separate municipalities. The change was approved in 1970 by Governor Luis A. Ferré .  \\n\nLike other nearby towns, the proximity of Canóvanas to the capital, San Juan , has allowed extraordinary urban and commercial development in the region. The municipality became renown in the 1990s for popularizing the urban legend of the chupacabras .\\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides,   and caused catastrophic damages in Canóvanas. Five cases of Leptospirosis were reported in Canóvanas.  \\n\nGeography\nCanóvanas sits on the Northern Coastal Plain region of Puerto Rico. It is bordered by the municipalities of Loíza , Río Grande , Las Piedras , Juncos , Gurabo , and Carolina .  Canóvanas covers only 28 square miles (72.8 km 2 ).  \\n\nCanóvanas combines flat alluvial plains in the center and north, areas with both gentle hills and rugged, deeply dissected mountainous areas made up of volcaniclastic rocks ( lava flows and exposed intrusive igneous rocks ) to the southeast and south. The Cuchilla de Santa Inés , a karstic limestone hill ( mogote ) with an elevation of 328 feet, rises from coastal sediments on the northeast of the municipality near San Isidro, while the Cuchilla El Asomante lies at the south with elevations that range from 656 to 2,296 feet.\\n\nOn the southeast, Canóvanas features portions of the Sierra de Luquillo mountain range, with the Cerro El Negro being the tallest peak in the municipality at 2,592 feet. Other notable peaks are La Peregrina (1,903 feet) and Pitahaya (951 feet), both located at Barrio Hato Puerco.  \\n\nMuch of the flat plains are part of the flood-prone alluvial valley of the Río Grande de Loíza and its main tributaries, the Río Canóvanas and Río Canovanillas . Floods are typical during the storm season, between June and November. Other important tributaries are the Río Herrera and Río Cubuy , as well as numerous creeks.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Canóvanas is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.    \\n\nThe urban center of Canóvanas is located along Road PR-3 , historically the main road between San Juan and Fajardo .\\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Canóvanas: Cambalache, Jardines de Palmarejo, Sector Quintas, La Central, Sector Pueblo Indio, La Central, Sector Sierra Maestra, La Central, Sector Villa Borinquén, Las 400, Las Lomas, Palma Sola , Parcelas Nuevas in San Isidro, Parcelas Viejas in San Isidro, Sector Alturas de Campo Rico, Sector Los Navarros, Sector Monte Verde, Sector Valle Hills,   Sector Villa Delicias, Villa Conquistador II, Villa Hugo 1, Villa Hugo II, and Villa Sin Miedo.   \\n\nDemographics\nOfficial population records for Canóvanas start in 1980, after the municipality was officially separated from Loíza . In 30 years, the population has increased by almost 50% according to the 2010 census .   \\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 61% of the population identifies themselves as white , and 21.6% as black . Also, 48.6% of the population identified themselves as males, and 51.4% as females. Finally, 26.7% of the population is under 18 years old. The next biggest percentage of population (21.5%) is between 35 and 49 years old.  \\n\nTourism\nAlthough Canóvanas is not particularly known for its touristic importance, there are several landmarks and places of interest to visit. The Jesús T. Piñero House is located along the PR-3 . The residence, which was built around 1931, houses a museum dedicated to the life of Jesús T. Piñero , first Puerto Rican governor of the island.   \\n\nThe Hipódromo Camarero is also a tourist attraction for horserace enthusiasts of the island and the Caribbean .  Other places of interest are the ruins of the Canóvanas Sugar Mill , El Español Bridge, the Old Ceiba Tree , and Villarán Park, which features the historic Villarán Bridge , the only one of its kind in Puerto Rico and the United States.\\n\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Canóvanas page lists Pico el Toro , El Hipódromo and the Pueblo with its historic architecture, as places of interest.  \\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Canóvanas has traditionally relied on agriculture, primarily sugarcane and coffee . There was an important sugar mill located in the PR-951 from Canóvanas to Loíza. It belonged to Loíza Sugar Company , and then to Fajardo Sugar Company . However, the mill closed in 1965.  In 1999, the structure was declared of historical importance by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico .  There\\'s also growth of minor vegetables and fruits, as well as a minor cattle and poultry industry. Most of Canóvanas flat areas are subject to occasional flooding and are used as pastures for cattle.\\n\nBest Iguana Puerto Rico Meat in Canóvanas is the only company in Puerto Rico certified for processing, packaging and distributing iguana meat . The green iguana is an invasive species of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nIn recent years, Canóvanas economy has shifted to commerce and industry, supplemented by the production of fresh milk. There has also been an increase in retail businesses. There are three main shopping malls, located along the PR-3 in the Canóvanas region. These malls such as The Outlet 66 Mall are the location of main stores like Wal-Mart , Marshalls , Burlington , and others.\\n\nCanóvanas is referred to as \"The Door to the East\" due to its location on the eastern edge of the San Juan Metropolitan Area sprawl, and its proximity to the northeast region of Puerto Rico. Also the expansion of Route 66 has sparked new interest in Canóvanas as an industrial and commercial sector. Recently the largest local supermarket chain brand Econo , has started the construction of its consolidated operations facilities with the construction of a super complex which will have the administrative headquarters, cold storage warehouse and main storages.\\n\nThe municipal government has an economic development plan called Canovanas Opened for Business in which it provides fast legal and permit assistance, tax breaks and incentives for new commercial opportunities moving or establishing their businesses in Canóvanas. This has prompted the emergence of new small businesses and high demand for professional and technical services.\\n\nThe industrial sector is growing with large international pharmaceuticals like AstraZeneca , IPR Pharmaceuticals, QBD, and other manufacturing plants in Canóvanas.\\n\nCulture\nCanóvanas celebrates its patron saint festival in October. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Sra. del Pilar is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Canóvanas include:\\n\nAlthough Canóvanas has no professional sports team currently active, several of its past teams have been notable. Traditionally, local sports teams bear the nickname of \"Indios\". The Indios de Canóvanas , of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional , won the championship two years in a row (1983-1984) and reached the finals in 1988.  Guard Angelo Cruz and center Ramón Ramos were two of the key players of the team during that era. However, the team disappeared during the 1990s. There have been movements to reestablish the team, but they\\'ve been unsuccessful.  \\n\nThe Indias of Canóvanas team, from the Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino , also won a number of championships.\\n\nCanóvanas is also the location of Hipódromo Camarero , Puerto Rico\\'s only horse racetrack. The track, which was formerly named El Nuevo Comandante was established in 1976.  \\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years. The current mayor of Canóvanas is Lornna Soto , of the New Progressive Party (PNP). She is the daughter of long-serving former Mayor Jose \"Chemo\" Soto , who distinguished himself for his eccentricities in clothing,  and for successfully using the urban legend of the Chupacabra to promote the city.  His daughter, Lornna , also served as a member of the Senate of Puerto Rico from 2004 to 2013.\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VIII , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Pedro A. Rodríguez and Luis Daniel Rivera were elected as District Senators.  Representatives Javier Aponte Dalmau (District 38) and \\xc3\\x81ngel Bulerín (District 37) represent different regions of Canóvanas in the House of Representatives .\\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag of Canóvanas features a purple background with a wide yellow band across, and the town\\'s coat of arms in the center.  \\n\nThe coat of arms features a shield with the same colors (purple background and a yellow band). The colors are taken from the banner of the \"Hijos y Amigos Ausentes de Canóvanas\". A broken chain symbolizes the separation of Canóvanas from Loíza . The crown in the middle represents the supremacy of Cacique Canobaná. The laurels are a symbol of the 23 consecutive wins achieved by the Loíza Indians basketball team, establishing a record in Puerto Rico, also represented by the basket in the middle. The rising sun, with its sixteen rays of light, indicate the sprouting of a new municipality in Puerto Rico and the number of incumbent mayors before Canóvanas was separated from Loíza.  \\n\nThe coat of arms also features a white banner below with the inscription \"1130 1909, Canobaná del Cayniabón, 8-16 1970\". The first date, November 30, 1909, is the date of the installation of the municipal seat of Loíza in Canóvanas. The second date, August 15, 1970, is the date of the official founding of Canóvanas as a separate municipality. The names of Canobaná and Cayniabón make reference to the Taíno heritage of the region. Finally, a coronet in the form of a three-tower mural crown stands above the shield.   \\n\nCanóvanas is known by various names. It is known as the \"Pueblo Valeroso\" after Cacique Yuira lost her life defending the Spanish people from her own people, the Taínos . It is also known as the \"City of Indians\" because of its important Taíno heritage. Canóvanas is also known as the \"City of Races\", because of the Hipódromo Camarero , and the \" Town of the Chupacabras \" because of the alleged sightings of the creature, and the beliefs in it of former mayor, José Chemo Soto .  \\n\nTransportation\nThe main road to Canóvanas is the PR-3 that crosses the municipality from east to west. Distance from the capital is roughly 15 minutes.  Other roads that lead to Canóvanas are PR-185 that enters between the Lomas and Hato Puerco barrios, PR-186 of the Cubuy ward, and PR-957 of the Hato Puerco ward. Roads 874 and 188 enter the town from the north, the former at Torrecillas Alta from Carolina and the latter at Canóvanas Pueblo from Loíza . In 2012, the PR-66 , which starts in Carolina , was extended to lead directly into Canóvanas.  \\n\nThere is also a terminal for public cars in front of the town square, as well as service provided by taxis, and independent public cars.\\n\nCanovanas is reasonably close to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Carolina and to the Port of San Juan .\\n\nThere are 29 bridges in Canóvanas.  \\n\nBooks\nCanóvanas, Puerto Rico The Cradle of The Indians by Greg Boudonck, Translated by Maria Ruiz O\\'Farrill\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCataño, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nCataño  is a town and municipality located on the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico , bordering the San Juan Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, and adjacent to the north and east by San Juan ; north of Bayamón and Guaynabo ; east of Toa Baja and west of Guaynabo and is part of the San Juan Metropolitan Area . Cataño is spread over 7 barrios and Cataño Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nHernando de Cataño was chosen to offer his medical services in Puerto Rico during Francisco Bahamonde de Lugo\\'s tenure as Governor of Puerto Rico (1564-1568). He was one of the first physicians who arrived in Puerto Rico during its colonization  and, upon accepting his position, received as payment a piece of land across the San Juan islet. From that time, the region started to be recognized by the name of its original owner. As people started establishing in the area, Cataño was declared as a barrio of Bayamón . However, there wasn\\'t much success in the town\\'s development during these years due to its swamp -like terrain. Still, around 1690, a hermitage was established to allow residents to receive religious services without having to travel to Bayamón.\\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, a ferry company was founded to facilitate the transportation of merchandise and passengers through the San Juan Bay . This spurred a growth in the population of Cataño, transforming it into one of the most prosperous barrios of Bayamón. Still, attempts to separate themselves from Bayamón in 1839 were unsuccessful. On June 26, 1893, Bishop Antonio Puig y Montserrat separated the barrios of Cataño , Palo Seco , and Palmas from Bayamón\\'s parish and established an independent parish for the residents of these sectors. In 1927, Cataño was officially declared a municipality with the name Hato de Palmas de Cataño , which overtime was simply shortened to Cataño.\\n\nPolitics played a crucial part in the foundation of the town, since Bayamón was controlled by an administration with opposing ideologies to those of the island\\'s Legislature. The separation of Cataño from Bayamón was a strategy to weaken that opposition.  \\n\nWith only 12.5 square kilometres (4.8 sq mi) of territory, Cataño is the smallest municipality in Puerto Rico. It is less than half the size of Hormigueros , the next-smallest in area.\\n\nThe people of Cataño were left in despair when Hurricane María struck on September 20, 2017, destroying their infrastructure and homes. With winds of 240 kilometres per hour (150 mph) the hurricane destroyed and flooded an estimated 650 homes and the roads became rivers (flooded).  An estimated 80% of homes in the Juana Matos area of Cataño were destroyed.  \\n\nGeography\nCataño consists mostly of flat plains that belong to the Northern region of Puerto Rico . Its northern shore falls on the San Juan Bay of the Atlantic Ocean.   \\n\nLocated in Cataño are a number of rivers, streams, named and unnamed creeks, and channels including:    \\n\nCataño is divided into only two barrios : Cataño barrio-pueblo , and Palmas .   \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English).  The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Cataño: Cucharillas, Juana Matos, Puente Blanco, and Puntilla.   \\n\nCulture\nCataño celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Sra. del Carmen is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOne of the main tourist attractions in Cataño is the boardwalk or tablado that commands a view of the San Juan Bay, including views of Fort San Felipe del Morro on the opposing side. There are several monuments and sculptures along the boardwalk, including a monument to Taíno culture called \"India Taína\".\\n\nThe Bacardi Distillery also offers tours of its facilities to visitors who want to learn about the rum manufacturing industry in the island and the Caribbean .  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Cataño page lists Lancha de Cataño , Malecón de Cataño ,  and Casa Bacardí , as places of interest.  \\n\nThe town gained notoriety in 1998, when Mayor Edwin Rivera Sierra traveled to Russia and acquired a huge statue of Christopher Columbus called \" Birth of the New World \". The statue Columbus by Tsereteli was designed by artist Zurab Tsereteli and would measure 350 feet (110 m) when erected. Tsereteli had offered the statue to the United States as a gift in 1992 with the intention to use it for the celebrations of the 500th year of its voyage. However, it was rejected. The transportation of the statue from Russia to Cataño cost $2.4 million. After arriving on the island, the 2,700 bronze pieces of the statue were scattered in a terrain awaiting for funds for the project, but Rivera Sierra was unable to garner enough public support or funding for it. The statue was installed in Arecibo .  \\n\nCataño has a number of professional sports teams [ citation needed ] , and there are several important sports facilities located in the town, including the Perucho Cepeda Stadium, the Pedro Rodríguez Gaya Boxing Coliseum, and the Cosme Beitía Salamo Coliseum.\\n\nEconomy\nDue to its location, Cataño has always played an important role as a port to the island. [ citation needed ] Fishing has also been a main source of economy for centuries [ citation needed ] . Bacardi , one of the largest rum manufacturers of the world, has a distillery in Cataño.\\n\nOther industries established in the town are refineries, commerce companies, transport and logistics, among others.\\n\nDemographics\nDespite its small size, Cataño has a large population when compared to municipalities of similar areas. This is perhaps due to its location near the capital of San Juan . The population, according to the 2000 census, was 30,071 with a population density of 2,322.1 peopleper square kilometre (6,014.2 people /sq mi). Although the current population is almost the double of what it was in the 1950 census, the current census reflects a small decrease of inhabitants.\\n\nAs a whole, Puerto Rico is populated mainly by people from a Mulatto (Of African and European descent) and European descent, with small groups of African and Asian people . Statistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 66.9% of Catañenses have Spanish or White ancestry, 8.6% are black , 0.8% are Amerindian etc.\\n\nGovernment\nAfter its initial establishment, Cataño belonged to the Bayamón region. From 1839 to 1845, there were some attempts to separate the barrio from Bayamón, but these were unsuccessful. However, on late 19th century, Bishop Antonio Puig y Montserrat managed to separate Cataño establishing their own parish. Cataño was finally declared a municipality on April 25, 1927, being its first mayor Alberto Dávila.\\n\nIn 1987, Edwin Rivera Sierra was elected as Mayor of Cataño. He remained in the position for 16 years, quitting in 2003. He was replaced by Wilson Soto , who was then officially elected at the 2004 elections in Puerto Rico . After losing a reelection bid in 2008 against José Rosario , Soto was indicted on nine charges.  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district II , which is represented by two senators. Migdalia Padilla and Carmelo Ríos Santiago have served as district senators since 2005.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag consists of nine horizontal stripes: four blue stripes and five white stripes (substituting for the silver color on the coat of arms). A white and green band traverses diagonally the drape in all its extension, from the upper hoist to the lower fly.  \\n\nThe green color represents the palm trees that are also present in the coat of arms . The flag was officially adopted during José Alvarez Brunet tenure as mayor on September 5, 1974.  \\n\nThe coat of arms of Cataño consists of nine horizontal stripes of same the width: four blue and five silver. The colors of the coat and the flag represent the coat of arms of the family of Don Hernando de Cataño, an Hidalgo to whom the town owes its name. The color silver represents nobility and the color blue was used by hidalgos on their armories. It symbolizes royalty and serenity.  \\n\nOn top of the coat of arms, there\\'s a crown with three towers distinct of others coat of arms. The coat itself is surrounded by two green palm trees , an allusion to one of the original names of the town: Hato de las Palmas de Cataño.  \\n\nAside of its name, derived from its original owner, Cataño has several nicknames . The city is known as \"La Antesala de la Capital\" (the Foyer of the Capital) because of its location across the bay from the capital-city of San Juan . In the 1960s, the residents of Cataño jokingly called it \"Fanguito Town\" because of its \\nmany muddy streets and shacks built on stilts over tidal flats.     \\n\nEducation\nCataño has several public and private schools managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Education .\\n\nTransportation\nPuerto Rico Highway 22 provides access to Cataño from San Juan or from other adjacent towns. Like most other towns in the island, it has a public transportation system consisting of public cars. Taxis are also available around the town.\\n\nCataño also has a ferry service known as La Lancha de Cataño , or the Ferry of Cataño. The ferry service, which has been working since 1853, operates a five-minute harbor route between Cataño and Old San Juan , and vice versa daily. There is a large ferry terminal at Cataño, and tourists can enjoy the view of the Castillo del Morro and the large cruise ships docked at the old San Juan terminal during this journey.  \\n\nThere are 16 bridges in Cataño.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nFurther reading"

Cayey is spread over 21 barrios plus Cayey Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nCayey is notable for its surrounding mountains. The city has been actively growing since the 1990s, evidenced by its designation as a Metropolitan Area by the U.S. Census Bureau . It has experienced significant growth in commerce, and many major retailers, such as Wal-Mart have opened stores in the city. Industries in Cayey include sugar, tobacco and poultry. For tobacco there is a well-known company called Consolidated Cigar Corp.  A new coliseum and hospital facilities have also been built. Coca-Cola is a major corporation that has a manufacturing facility in the town. Cayey is also host to one of the campuses of the University of Puerto Rico , the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey .\\n\nHistory\nCayey was founded on August 17, 1773, by Juan Mata Vázquez, who became its first mayor. It is popularly said that Cayey derives its name from the Taíno word for \"a place of waters\". It was named Cayey de Muesas in honor of Miguel de Muesas , the then governor of Puerto Rico. The town is located in a valley nestled between Puerto Rico\\'s Cordillera Central mountain range and the Sierra de Cayey at roughly the midpoint of routes PR-1 and PR-52 . The routes lead to a popular drive that provides panoramic views of the island from its highest points.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Cayey was 14,442.  \\n\nAn education base began in the early to mid-1950s when the Interamerican University opened a branch in Cayey providing teacher training through a night class scheme. In 1967 the University of Puerto Rico opened a campus in the former Henry Barracks Military Reservation, and in the early 1980s El Turabo University , subsidiary of the Ana G. Mendez conglomerate opened a campus in the old tobacco factory at the entrance of town. The Interamerican University will be opening a Graduate campus in front of the main town square ( downtown ), and there are conversations with a foreign educational concern to open a technology campus using the buildings left over by the Gordonshire Knitting Mills. There are three major private schools: Radians School, the long established Colegio de Nuestra Senora de la Merced and La Milagrosa School. Cayey\\'s health care base expanded in the mid-1960s with the Mennonite Medical Center and a Municipal\\nHospital along with laboratories, and urgent care centers that cater to the poor and the elderly.\\n\nWith the construction of the Interstate ( PR-52 ), Cayey has evolved into a \" bedroom community \" with gated housing developments, located just 30 minutes away from San Juan and 45 minutes away from Ponce . With pleasant weather and good private schools, Cayey has become a premium location for the affluent.\\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Cayey with significant amount of rain and wind.   The hurricane destroyed 3,000 homes in Cayey.  \\n\nHenry Barracks Military Reservation was a lifeline for the residents of Cayey from 1901 to 1966, when it was declared excess land and passed to the General Services Administration for decommission. The property consisted of 178.03 hectares (439.92 acres)  (  ). The property was divided into three prominent encampments: the Spanish Camp or Campamento Español (6.1 hectares (15 acres) ), Camp Henry or Henry Barracks, the Home of the third Battalion of the 65th Inf. Regiment that consisted of 151 hectares (372 acres) , and 27 hectares (67 acres)  the Cayey Naval Radio Station (27 hectares (67 acres) )  ). This reservation is situated in the east of the town of Cayey. The Spanish Reservation containing an area of approximately 6.1 hectares (15 acres) , known as Hospital Hill was set apart by Executive Order of June 30, 1903, under an Act of Congress approved on July 7, 1902.  The main army post was located in the northern part of the reservation, initially housing the Puerto Rico Volunteer Infantry Regiment .\\n\nThe combined posts had approximately 1,200 men who used the resources provided by the town people. Families moved into Punta Brava and Vieques neighborhoods. A laundry, show shop, and other smaller stores were located right outside the gate. By 1906 about 350 civilians had jobs in the two posts (Camp Henry and The Cayey Navy Radio Station).\\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Navy submitted a proposal to raise three 190 metres (620 ft)  tall masts as part of a global radio communication linkage. In 1916 the Department of the Navy approved a budget of $40,000. At the time 300 men were hired to build the facility for a period of two-year, the project was completed in 1918  \\n\nOn September 11, 1928, a category five hurricane called San Felipe destroyed the temporary buildings at Henry Barracks, and the Navy Radio Station.  A radio message was sent from the Cayey Navy Radio Station on September 18, 1928, to follow \"All buildings Henry Barracks destroyed by hurricane September 13th\".  \\nThe Navy left Cayey and moved its station to Isla Grande and Stop 7 1 ⁄ 2 in Puerto de Tierra. All the land held by the Navy included Magazine Hill (known in the community as \"El Polvorin\"), which was taken over by the U. S. Army . The 65th Infantry Regiment remained in the north side of the post. The south side was converted into two 300 metres (1,000 ft)  shooting ranges  \\nThe decision was made to reconstruct all building for the regiment in the north side in concrete  One hundred and ninety buildings were completed, to include the north side of Henry Barracks.  Over 600 men were hired for a period of three years to work in these projects. During this period three large barrack buildings were constructed. The two one company barracks each had its own mess hall and kitchen and was occupied by an infantry company each. The two companies barrack located in the center of the quad occupied the Battalion Headquarters Co. and the Machine Gun Co.  \\n\nBy 1953, the U.S. Department of the Army had reached the conclusion that Henry Barracks would be closed in the near future. A full complement of maintenance personnel composed of professional, technical, and daily laborers were maintained in the Reservation. The growth of three major housing developments is evidence of the economic impact of the Reservation (Reparto Montellano, El Polvorin, Urbanización Aponte)  \\nWhile the all-Puerto Rican 65th Infantry regiment would never return to its home base, several other initiatives were undertaken, which had a direct impact on the economic development of the town and the region, one such initiatives was the commissioning of the Caribbean Signal Agency in 1959. Over the coming years several tenants occupied the lands comprised by the Henry Barracks Military Reservation, among them:\\n\nGeography\nCayey is located in a valley surrounded by the Sierra de Cayey , a branching mountain range of the Cordillera Central where the Carite Forest Reserve is located, and the main ranges of the Cordillera Central to the west. Because of its location, Cayey is known for its mountains, its cool weather and its misty mornings, especially in winter. During Spanish colonial rule, Spanish soldiers assigned to Puerto Rico were sent to Cayey. Its cool weather resembled the weather of Spain and soldiers could become acclimated to the tropical weather. In winter, it is not unusual for the temperature to drop into the 10 °C (50 °F).  \\n\nThe Carite Forest Reserve \\n\nCayey\\'s climate is humid, rainy and mild compared to lower-elevation areas of the island, the area of the town is nearly 1,500 feet (460 m) high, so the climate is subtropical high. In summer average high Temperatures are around 82 °F (28 °C) to 88 °F (31 °C) and 70 °F (21 °C) to 78 °F (26 °C) in winter, and low around 68 °F (20 °C) to 72 °F (22 °C) in summer and 57 °F (14 °C) to 63 °F (17 °C) in winter. The record maximum temperature is 94 °F (34 °C) and minimum 45 °F (7 °C). The average annual rainfall is 100 inches (2,540 mm) and maximum rainfall record in 24 hours is 20.87 inches (530 mm) of rain.\\n\nThe golden coquí ( Eleutherodactylus jasperi ; Spanish: coquí dorado ) is a rare and possibly extinct leptodactylid frog species endemic to Puerto Rico. Native to the municipality of Caye, golden coquís have only been found in areas of dense bromeliad growth in the Sierra de Cayey between 2,123 and 2,575 feet (647 and 785 meters) above sea level. They get their name from the song the male coquis sing at night. It sounds like \"cokee, cokee\" so that is why they are called coqui in Spanish. The golden coqui is the smallest of the coqui frogs in Puerto Rico. Mature adult coquis are only roughly the size of a dime. Male coquis are more bright yellow where females tend to be more light yellow and brown. The golden coqui is the only frog species in the New World known to give birth to live young. These frogs are known around the whole island and are considered a symbol of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Cayey is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.   \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Cayey: Parcelas Nuevas in Beatriz, Cantera, Sector Jalda Abajo, Cedro, El Coquí, Jájome Bajo, La Placita, Saint Thomas, San Cristóbal, and La Vega.   \\n\nTelemundo WKAQ-TV Tower, situated at 18°6\\'47\"N 66°3\\'9\"W, is a 1,105 feet (336.8 m) tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting. It was built in 1971 and it is the second tallest man-made structure of Puerto Rico.\\n\nThe Pedro Montañez Municipal Stadium in Cayey, proceeded by the first Pedro Montañez Municipal Stadium in Cayey, is the home of the Toritos de Cayey Double-A baseball team,  and the Benigno Fernandez Garcia Jr. High School \\'s field day competitions.\\n\nThe Cayey Pegasus Broadcasting tower, at coordinates 18°6\\'33\"N and 66°3\\'2\"W is the third-tallest structure in Puerto Rico. It is a guyed mast owned by Hemisphere Media Group with a height of 1,091 feet (332.5 m), which was built in 1966.\\n\nEconomy\nCayey\\'s economy was based on growing tobacco, sugarcane and general fruits. Its agricultural economy that evolved starting in the 1950s has diminished considerably. Most of its agricultural products are imported from other islands in the Caribbean or mainland United States .\\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century,  Cayey was basically an agricultural area of small farmers and local haciendas dedicated to the farming of crops for the local market. During the 1920s and 1930s farmers increasingly lost their land to absentee landowners, mostly American companies, that turned to the cultivation of sugarcane and, to a lesser extent, tobacco for export. In the 1950s and 1960s some manufacturing concerns established plants in Cayey taking advantage of tax incentives offered by Operation Bootstrap , Puerto Rico\\'s industrialization program.\\n\nAn industrial base, in 1947 Cayey saw the beginning of industrial entrepreneurship. There were three factories in town, the Caribe Flower Co. in the Palo Seco neighborhood, a Baseball Factory in the Toita neighborhood, and a Uniform Factory in the back of the High School. These factories employed mostly females. By 1950 the men that worked agriculture became excess population and began migrating to the United States or join the military. In 1950 with the approval of Fomento Industrial and Operation Bootstrap there was a boom of light factories in Cayey. The Gordonshire Knitting Mill in the Guayama road had twelve large buildings and ran two shifts with more than 1,000 employees, and the Consolidated Cigar Corporation across from the road from the Reparto Montellano neighborhood operated three shifts employing over 2,500 from Cayey and surrounding towns.\\n\nThere is a Coca-Cola bottling location in Cayey.  \\n\nThe Cayey Massacre , in 1994, took place partly in Cayey.\\n\nIn August 2019, El Vocero newspaper reported there had been three mass shootings, that year, in Cayey.  \\n\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Cayey page lists the \"gastronomic route\" in Guavate barrio, Casa del Cuento y la Historia Cayeyana Ramón \"Moncho\" Gomez , Bosque de Pinos , and agrotourism at Siempre Verde , as places of interest.  \\n\nCayey is a mountainous municipality with many places of interest.  \\n\nThere are seven places in Cayey listed on the US National Register of Historic Places :  \\n\nOther landmarks, landscapes and places of interest are:\\n\nCulture\nCayey celebrates its patron saint festival in August. The Fiestas Patronales Nuestra Señora de Asunción is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as Grupo Mania , Sonora Ponceña , José Alberto \"El Canario\" , Lalo Rodriguez , Ednita Nazario , and El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico .  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Cayey include:\\n\nDemographics\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years.

        "page_content": "Contents\nCeiba, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nCeiba  is both a small town and a municipality in northeast Puerto Rico . It is named after the famous Ceiba tree. Ceiba is located in the north-east coast of the island, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, south of Fajardo , north of Naguabo and southeast of Río Grande . Located about one hour\\'s driving distance from San Juan , Ceiba is spread over 7 barrios and Ceiba Pueblo (the downtown area and administrative center). It is part of the Fajardo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nCeiba was founded on April 7, 1838 by Luis de la Cruz. Ceiba derives its name from an Indian word Seyba, which is the name for a famous tree that grows in the island, Ceiba pentandra , the kapok tree.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico and the population numbers of Ceiba were consolidated with the population numbers of Fajardo.  \\n\nCeiba, situated near Fajardo, used to be home of an American military Naval base, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station . Most of the units were relocated and the base was closed in 2004. Ex-governor Sila María Calderón suggested turning the property into a major international airport, to serve as a relief to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan , and to increase the number of international airlines that operate into Puerto Rico. She was met with skepticism about these plans from such groups as environmentalists, economists and others, but in 2008, José Aponte de la Torre Airport was inaugurated at the base\\'s former site.\\n\nLocals are commonly known as \" Los Come Sopa \" ( Spanish for \\'the soup-eaters\\'). Even though there is no official reason as to why they are called this, a few stories have been suggested. Among the tales is the belief that since the town did not have a local meat market people had to travel long distances in order to buy some meat and therefore mostly ate soup. [ citation needed ] \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Ceiba.   Forty-nine structures in Punta Figuera were destroyed completely.  In July 2018, some residents received monies via FEMA to rebuild their homes.  \\n\nGeography\nThe Reserva Natural Medio Mundo y Daguao (Nature Reserve Medio Mundo and Daguao) extends along the coastline between Ceiba and Fajardo .  95% of the forest is classified as mangrove . Various species of birds can be seen as well as turtles and manatees . Its rivers includes; Río Daguao , Río Demajagua and Río Fajardo .  \\n\nThe municipality extends northwest into the seas between Fajardo and Culebra and thereby includes the reefs and islets named Arrecifes Hermanos and Arrecifes Barriles .  The reef are closest to the coastal barrio of Machos, but barrio boundaries are not defined in that area.  \\n\nThe highest point in the municipality is Pico del Oeste in the Sierra de Luquillo at 3,346 feet (1,020 m) of elevation.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Ceiba is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English).

This maintains the same symbolism given to the coat of arms. It is made of two vertical lines of the same width, red in the left side and green on the right. The red side depicts a yellow cross.  \\n\nThe Ceiba coat of arms depicts a shield with a Ceiba tree. In the upper part of the shield is a red horizontal space with a golden cross in the middle and a golden fleur-de-lis on either side. The cross symbolizes the Christian faith as well recognizing Luis de la Cruz as Ceiba\\'s founder. Around the shield are sugar cane stalks. Above the shield there is a golden Spanish fort.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCiales, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nCiales  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico , located on the Central Mountain Range , northwest of Orocovis ; south of Florida and Manatí ; east of Utuado and Jayuya ; and west of Morovis . Ciales is spread over eight barrios and Ciales Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nToponym\nSources diverge on the origin of the Ciales name. Nineteenth-century historian Cayetano Coll y Toste stated that it was named as such by then-governor Gonzalo de Aróstegui Herrera in honor of General Luis de Lacy , who had gone against Ferdinand VII\\'s absolutist wishes.  Coll y Toste suggested that the Villa Lacy  name came from the anagram \"es-la-cy\" anagram.   \\n\nOther sources, such as Manuel \\xc3\\x81lvarez Nazario and Luis Hernández Aquino, put forward the theory that it comes from the plural of cibales , plural form of ciba , meaning \"stony place\" or \"place of stones\" in Taíno , which \"had undergone loss of the intervocalic -b- and the addition of the Spanish suffix referring to place -al.\" Lisa Cathleen Green-Douglass, who carried out a study of toponymics in Puerto Rico and compared both theories, believed the latter to be most plausible since Coll y Toste, per Green-Douglass, must have defined an anagram as a reversal of syllables and the resulting \"Cial\" or \"Cyal\" would have to then be made plural.  \\n\nYet others believe it originates from the Spanish sillar (meaning \"carved stones\") in reference to the stones carved by the Río Grande de Manatí\\'s currents.  \\n\nHistory\nUntil its founding on June 24, 1820, by Isidro Rodríguez,  it was part of  the neighboring Manatí municipality, a process that took four years to achieve.  \\n\nOn 13 August 1898, after the armistice ending the Spanish-American War was signed, Ciales was one of three towns that held uprisings. Led by Ventura Casellas, between three hundred and four hundred individuals proclaimed the Republic of Puerto Rico. However, it has not been determined without a shadow of a doubt whether it was a clear independence-supporting event or a defense of Spanish rule .  Edwin Karli Padilla Aponte calls it an \"alleged revolutionary uprising\" since he finds no official historical record for it, even though it appears in a vignette in the Pueblos Hispanos monthly written by a Gabriel Aracelis, a possible pseudonym for Juan Antonio Corretjer . The column describes the battle, mentions the participants by name and connects it to the Grito de Lares by identifying a Pedro González as a grandson of a Manuel González who allegedly fought in the 1868 revolt, establishing a continuity between both events. Paul G. Miller , Education Commissioner between 1915 and 1921, considered this to be caused by the Seditious Parties ( Partidas Sediciosas ), gangs of bandits that raided Spaniards\\' homes in the late-nineteenth century, an idea that Corretjer refuted.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Ciales was 18,115.  \\n\nThe first truss bridge erected in Puerto Rico, after the signing of the Treaty of Paris , is in Ciales. It is over the Río Grande de Manatí and is on the list of National Register of Historic Places .\\n\nHurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, its eye passing through northeastern Ciales,  leaving all municipalities without power for months. Ciales received 19.23 inches of rain which caused landslides. An estimated 3,000 homes in Ciales were completely destroyed by Hurricane María.  Three months after the hurricane struck, engineers were hoping to have electrical service established, at least for the Ciales barrio-pueblo (downtown) area.  The following December, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced the opening of a disaster recovery center in Ciales to attend the home and business owners, as well as tenants, affected by the hurricane.  \\n\nAn Energy Consortium was signed in late February, 2019 by Villalba , Orocovis , Morovis , Ciales and Barranquitas municipalities. The consortium is the first of its kind for the island. It is intended to have municipalities work together to safeguard and create resilient, and efficient energy networks, with backups for their communities. This is part of the hurricane preparedness plan of these municipalities, which were hit particularly hard by Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017.  \\n\nGeography\nThe northern part of the municipality is located in the Northern Karst zone of Puerto Rico while the southern part is in the Cordillera Central . The highest point in the municipality is Cerro Rosa at 4,143 feet (1,262 m), itself the third highest point in Puerto Rico. Ciales is home to a forest reserve called Toro Negro Forest Reserve and a number of rivers including: Río Cialitos , Río Grande de Manatí , Río Toro Negro , Río Yunes ,  Pozas, and Barbas.  Over 40% of its territory falls within protected areas, ranking as the 6th municipality with the largest portion of protected territory overall.  Consequentially, the destruction of 508 native planted trees at the Finca Don Ingenio in the Toro Negro Forest Reserve in August 2021 was caused for an uproar. The trees, which included ceiba and maga specimens, had been planted as part of the Hurricane María recovery by the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust\\'s Para La Naturaleza program.  \\n\nAs part of the karst region, there are many caves, such as Archillas Cave, located in Jaguas Ventana , named after the family that owns it. Since Ciales has a saying \"to graduate as a Cialeño, you have to go up to the Archillas,\" [ a ] then-mayor Luis R. Maldonado Rodriguez attempted to acquire it. The cave has been associated with the Arcaicos, though it also holds some Taíno petroglyphs. The cave system was first studied by Alphonse L. Pinart in 1890. Since then several investigations have been carried out that have aided in the identification of silex as the main material used by the Taíno for their carving tools and the discovery of ceramic fragments , as well as the theory that the caves were used for rituals, such as cojoba-induced ceremonies .  During his research in the early 1900s, Jesse Walter Fewkes identified the Ciales\\' caves as some those occupied by the Taíno  as well as several of the best preserved sites with their stone-carved implements .  One of these caves, La Cohoba Cave, was named after the namesake object found in it.  Another notable find, carried out by Carlos M. Ayes Suárez, was of a zoomorphic idol from the Arcaico era in Pesas that \"consists of a cobble that presents an engraved representation seemingly zoomorphic in shape\" which is considered unique in Puerto Rico and the Antilles.  \\n\nDue to the mountainous nature of Ciales\\' topography, landslides occur, such as the rock fall that occurred in June 2021 in Pozas that caused several buildings and fences to be destroyed, road closures and the removal of residents.   \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Ciales is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English).  The types of sectores may vary, from sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.  \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Ciales: Sector El Hoyo in Pozas, Calle Morovis, Comunidad Los Ortega, Cruces-Cialitos, Parcelas Cordillera, Parcelas María, Parcelas Seguí, Santa Clara, and Toro Negro.  \\n\nDemographics\nCiales has one of the lowest percentages of English speakers in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nWhen researching the town\\'s parochial baptismal records historian Fernando Picó found that more than half the offspring baptised at the end of the nineteenth century were born out of wedlock .  \\n\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Ciales page lists Museo Juan Antonio Corretjer , Puente Mata de Plátano , and Cascada Las Delicias , as places of interest.  \\n\nPlaces of interest in Ciales include:  \\n\nCulture\nCiales celebrates its patron saint festival in October. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Señora del Rosario y San Jose is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as Sabor Latino .  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Ciales include:\\n\nCiales is the home town of Juan \"Pachín\" Vicens - Puerto Rico\\'s national basketball star, named Best Player in the World at the 1959 World Basketball Championship, Santiago de Chile (a.k.a., Juan \"Pachín\" Vicens, \"Astro del Balón\", \"El Jeep\"; younger brother of Puerto Rico\\'s National Poet, Nimia Vicens, who also hailed from Ciales). Their middle brother, Enrique \"Coco\" Vicens , a former Puerto Rico Senator, was a track and field athlete in his own right.\\n\nEconomy\nThe Ciales economy has always depended heavily on agriculture, especially coffee products, minor fruits (such as lettuce) and dairy production.   \\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor , elected every four years. The current mayor of Ciales is Alexander Burgos Otero , of the Progressive New Party (PNP) who had previously served in the municipal legislature and grandson of previous Ciales mayor, Roque Otero Cortés. He was elected at the 2020 general elections .   \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district III , which is represented by two Senators. In 2008, José Emilio González Velázquez and Angel Martínez Santiago were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  On the 150th anniversary of the founding of Ciales, the flag and coat of arms were adopted with Resolution No. 13 Series 1969-1970, sanctioned by Don Ismael Nazario, who was mayor at the time.  \\n\nThe flag is divided into seven unequal stripes described in sequence: yellow, red, yellow, purple, yellow, red, and yellow.   \\n\nThe coat of arms consists of a gold shield with a lion standing on its rear legs and silver-plated nails grasping a silver coiled parchment between its front claws. The lion also shows a red tongue. Above the lion in the superior part of the shield are located three heraldic roses arranged horizontally with red petals and green leaves.

        "page_content": "Contents\nCidra, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nCidra  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the central region of the island, north of Cayey ; south of Comerío and Aguas Buenas ; east of Aibonito and Barranquitas ; and west of Caguas . Cidra is spread over 12 barrios and Cidra Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nCidra is known as \"El Pueblo de la Eterna Primavera\" (\" Town of the Eternal Spring \") and \"El Pueblo de la Paloma Sabanera\" (\" Town of the Plain Pigeon \").\\n\nHistory\nThe region of what is now Cidra belonged to the Taíno region of Cubuy, which covered a portion of the center of Puerto Rico.  The region was led by cacique Caguax .\\n\nThere are not many records that show that the region was populated after the Spanish colonization . However, it is believed that around 1795, a Catalan named Frujols built a hermitage or shrine around which a small village settled. The settlement became a ward of Cayey , until 1807 when the residents gave the power to Victoriano de Rivera to ask the Governor for permission to found an independent town. In 1809, a landowner known as Bibiana Vázquez donated the land needed for the foundation, and Governor Salvador Meléndez approved the petition. Victoriano de Rivera was appointed to lead the town, but he was quickly replaced by Wenceslao Vázquez due to illness.  \\n\nAt the time of its foundation, Cidra had 26 houses and 11 huts. It is believed that its name is derived from the citron fruit which was widely cultivated in the region.   During the years following its foundation, a church and city hall were built. By 1822, there were already two public schools in town. Two years later, a road communicating the town with Caguas was opened. In 1868, the population of Cidra was more than 5,000 residents, which included European immigrants and slaves.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Cidra was 7,552.  \\n\nIn 1902, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a law for the consolidation of certain municipalities. As a result, Cidra was again incorporated to the town of Cayey . However, in 1905 a new law revoked the previous one, turning Cidra into an independent municipality again.  \\n\nA category 5, and high-end category 4 Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico, on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Cidra. A week before Hurricane Irma , another category 5 had passed over Puerto Rico causing some damage. With Hurricane María, some areas of Cidra experienced more than 25 landslides per kilometer.   Citizens, with machetes in hand, worked to clear the roadways of debri after the hurricane hit, especially in Rabanal , Arena and Ceiba , barrios of Cidra located at high altitudes. 1500 homes were left without a roof and many would never receive funds for repairs. One local (analog) radio antenna survived the catastrophe allowing for some communication within the town to take place. Before the hurricane there had been plans to eliminate the radio tower, but when 92.7% of Puerto Rico\\'s towers were destroyed by the hurricane, plans to eliminate the analog radio tower were scrapped. Puerto Rico Highway 172 , the main highway into Cidra from the San Juan area had to remain closed for repairs for five months. It was not until six months after the hurricane struck that power was restored to Cidra.   \\n\nGeography\nCidra is located at the top of a hill in the eastern part of the Cordillera Central . It is bordered by the municipalities of Aguas Buenas , Caguas , Cayey , Aibonito , and Comerío . Cidra is a small municipality, covering only 36.1 square miles (94 km 2 ).   \\n\nCidra\\'s hydrographic system consists mainly of Lago de Cidra reservoir, located in the municipality. The reservoir, which was built in 1946, provides water to several areas in the island.  There are also several rivers and creeks that cross the town like Arroyata , Bayamón , and Río de la Plata .\\n\nThe town is known for being the nesting place of the paloma sabanera (a subspecies of the plains pigeon). The bird, which is at risk of extinction , is currently found mostly in the municipality of Cidra and other nearby municipalities.  In addition, there is various species of fish residing in the Lago de Cidra, as well as iguanas which have been introduced into the surrounding the area and are now considered an invasive species .\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Cidra is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English).  The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.  \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Cidra: Barriada Ferrer, Candela, Comunidad San José (Laberinto), La Línea, La Milagrosa, Río Abajo , and Santa Teresita .  \\n\nPlaces of interest\nAlthough Cidra is not known as a tourist main stop, it has some attractions. The town center features historic places like the Parroquia Nuestra Señora del Carmen church  and the Iberia Theater, both built during the first half of the 20th century.\\n\nOn the outskirts of the town, there is Lake Cidra and Perico\\'s Waterfalls. Frog\\'s Rock and Hamacas Bridge are also landmarks visited by tourists.  \\n\nThe renovation of el Parque del Niño (children\\'s park), which includes water features and a skatepark was completed in 2019.  \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Cidra page lists Destilería Club Caribe , Mirador del Lago de Cidra , and Parque del Niño , as places of interest.  \\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Cidra has relied mostly on agriculture , particularly coffee , tobacco , and minor fruits. Cattle ranching is also a source of economy in the town. In recent years, pharmaceutical and clothing industries have become participants of the economy of Cidra.   \\n\nCulture\nCidra celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Sra. del Carmen is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nA number of cultural events take place during the year, most prominently:  \\n\nThere are a number of churches and chapels from several denominations in Cidra. The main Catholic parish, Parroquia Nuestra Señora del Carmen, was established in 1813.  The original structure was destroyed by earthquakes in the 1860s, but completely rebuilt by 1952.  Cidra\\'s patron saint is the Virgin Mary . Its festivities are held each July.\\n\nAlso in front of the town square is the First Baptist Church, which was established by missionary Edgar Humphrey in 1903. The original wood structure was destroyed in 1928 by San Felipe Hurricane , but rebuilt in concrete, wood, and zinc.  \\n\nCidra doesn\\'t have a professional sports team, however, they have a successful amateur team, Bravos de Cidra, that participate in the Puerto Rican Amateur Baseball Federation .   The Bravos team has won nine championships, and as of 2014, are en route to win their third consecutive one.  The main baseball facility is the Jesús María Freire Stadium, where the Bravos play.\\n\nCidra is also the birthplace of several important figures in the Puerto Rican sports scene. Some of them are former MLB players Luis Rivera and Luis López , as well as former coach of the Puerto Rico men\\'s national basketball team Flor Meléndez . Boxer José Pedraza was also born in Cidra.\\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Cidra increased steadily during the 20th Century. Since 1899, the population has risen more than 200%. According to the 2010 census, the municipality had 43,480 inhabitants.  The 2020 census shows a decline in population to 39,970.  \\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 77% of the population identifies themselves as White , and 8.3% as African-American . Also, 48.9% of the population identified themselves as males, and 51.1% as females. Finally, 25% of the population is under 18 years old. The next biggest percentage of population (20.7%) is between 35 and 49 years old.  \\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor , elected every four years. In the November 2019 elections, Angel David Concepción González  succeeded over the incumbent, Javier Carrasquillo , of the New Progressive Party (PNP) as mayor. He succeeded Angel L. Malavé Zayas in 2012, after Malavé was accused of lewd conduct in 2011. Malavé had served as mayor since being elected at the 1988 general elections .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VI , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Miguel Pereira Castillo and Angel M. Rodríguez were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  The coat of arms, flag and seal of Cidra were designed by J.J. Santa Pinter and approved on September 25, 1975 by Cidra.  \\n\nThe flag of Cidra features one brown vertical stripe on the left side, with a width of about one-third the length of the flag. It also features two equal-sized horizontal stripes to the right side of the brown one. The above stripe is green, while the lower one is yellow, or golden. The golden color symbolizes the richness of the fruits and its hydrography, as well as the spiritual wealth of the region. The green symbolizes the green landscape that can be seen in Cidra throughout the year, which is also the reason why the town is called the \"Town of the Eternal Spring\". The brown symbolizes the Virgin , patron saint of the town, and also the Paloma sabanera that is widely seen in the area.  \\n\nSome versions of the flag also feature the coat of arms on the left hand side, over the intersection of the three stripes. The coat of arms was approved in the 1970s by the Municipal Assembly. It features a red band crossing the shield diagonally, from left to right. Over the red band lies a golden citrus , which is believed to be one of the reasons for the town\\'s name, and a cornucopia of fruits, which alludes to Cidra\\'s role as one of the major producers of fruits of the island. The upper field is either white or silver, and features two symbols: a black scapular representing the Virgin, and a black bishop hat referencing San Juan Nepomuceno , bishop and martyr. The lower field is mostly blue and features a brown pigeon flying over a mountain range, representing the location of the town in the Central Mountain Range , and a set of silver water waves. The whole seal is capped by a three-tower crown, which is usually seen in municipal seals in the island.   \\n\nCidra is known mostly by two names. It is known as the \"Town of the Eternal Spring\" for its cool temperatures. It is also known as the \"Town of the Plain Pigeon\" because of the abundance of that bird in the town.  \\n\nEducation\nThere are around 15 public schools in Cidra. As with all other municipalities, education is handled by the Puerto Rico Department of Education .\\n\nTransportation\nThe main road to Cidra is Road 172 , which branches out from the Puerto Rico Highway 52 . Its distance from the capital is approximately 40 minutes.  Other roads that lead to the town are #787 and #173.\\n\nThere are 19 bridges in Cidra.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCoamo, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nCoamo  is a town and municipality founded in 1579 in the south-central region of Puerto Rico , located north of Santa Isabel ; south of Orocovis and Barranquitas ; east of Villalba and Juana Díaz ; and west of Aibonito and Salinas . The municipality of Coamo is spread over 10 barrios and Coamo Pueblo - the town or downtown area and administrative center of the city. The Coamo municipality is also a Micropolitan Statistical Area and as such is part of the Ponce-Yauco-Coamo Combined Statistical Area .\\n\nThe town of Coamo and parts of its barrios are nestled in a valley about 20 miles (32 km) east of the town of Ponce (about 40 minutes by car). It was named San Blas Illescas de Coamo by Spanish settlers in 1579. Saint Blaise ( San Blas ) was designated by the Catholic Church as the patron saint of the town, and so it remains presently. Illescas is the Spanish town where some of the town founders originated (nowadays in Toledo province , Castile-La Mancha, Spain).\\n\nThere are several theories regarding the origin of the word Coamo . One theory is that it comes from an indigenous word that means \"valley\". Another theory is that Coamo derives its name from Coamex (or Coamey ), who was a celebrated local cacique . Archeological digs in the municipality of Coamo have produced extensive evidence of pre-Columbian inhabitants of the area. \\n\nCoamo is famous for its natural hot springs, Los Baños de Coamo , and for its annual San Blas Half Marathon . The Battle of Coamo was a decisive battle of the Spanish-American War (1898).\\n\nHistory\nWhen Spanish settlers arrived, Coamo was inhabited by the Taino . Modern archeology has found evidence of at least four pre-columbian villages in the territory that is today the Coamo municipality:  \\n\nIt is believed the Coamo villages had  strong ties with the coastal village \"El Cayito\" (in what is now Santa Isabel municipality ) and the \"Toíta\" village (in what is now Cayey municipality ) due to the large quantities of marine shellfish remains found in the Coamo and Cayey villages.  \\n\nAfter the Taino rebellion of 1511 was defeated by the Spanish fuerzas españolas, the hard labor in encomiendas , epidemics of smallpox and other European diseases, and conversion to Catholicism and intermarriage with Spanish colonist contributed to the assimilation of the Taino into the Spanish society and culture.\\n\nFounded on July 15, 1579, the town of Coamo is the third-oldest settlement of the island\\'s post-Columbian period (after San Juan in the north and San Germán in the west). At that time, Coamo was the administrative center for a larger area that would eventually be subdivided into several municipalities: Guayama , Cayey , Juana Díaz , Orocovis , Barranquitas , Cidra , Patillas , Aibonito , Santa Isabel , Salinas and Arroyo .\\n\nBy 1582, there were twenty families living in Coamo, in the same area where the Tainos had had their village of Guayama [ citation needed ] . Coamo officially became a town in 1616, and was given the title of \"Villa\" by Spanish Royal Decree in 1778.\\n\nCoamo was the administrative center that encompassed most of the southern half of the island during the early colonial period. As the agricultural and sugar industries grew and became the mainstays of the colony\\'s economy, the province would eventually subdivide into several distinct municipalities, and the administrative center of the region would later shift west to the coastal town of Ponce .\\n\nCoamo is the home of a series of natural hot springs , Los Baños de Coamo , which have attracted visitors since before the Spaniards landed.  These springs were once rumored to have been Juan Ponce de León \\'s legendary fountain of youth . In the early nineteenth century, a system of pools of varying depths, sizes and temperatures was constructed at the site of these springs to serve as a spa for the colonials. During the American invasion in the Spanish-American War (1898), this site was the scene of one of the decisive battles of that conflict (the Battle of Coamo ). The American troops took possession of the island, and the spa was subsequently abandoned. Though the site lay in ruins for most of the twentieth century, it continued to be a landmark to the Coameños , who would often go to bathe in its healing thermal waters. The pools remain, but the old buildings which once hosted the island\\'s affluent and colonial soldiers are gone, except for the remains of one central wall structure. It has been preserved and incorporated into a fountain courtyard on the grounds of a popular tourist hotel and rest area and has replaced the ancient Spanish ruins.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Coamo was 15,144.  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Coamo with the significant amount of rainfall.    As of October 9, no one in Coamo had electrical service, only 15% of Coamo had access to clean drinking water, and several people on dialysis had died. Around 2,000 homes were partially or completely destroyed. The iconic Hotel Los Baños de Coamo was a total loss.  \\n\nGeography\nCoamo is located in the South Central region of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Coamo is subdivided into barrios .

Corozal is spread over 12 barrios and Corozal Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nThe city name is derived from the \" palma de corozo \" (grugru palm, Acrocomia media ) which abounds in the Cordillera Central zone of the Island.\\n\nHistory\nCorozal\\'s local Taino Indian Cacique (Chief) was named Orocobix and his tribe was known as the Jatibonicu Taino .  \\n\nCorozal was founded in 1795 and officially became a town in 1804. Commonly known as La Cuna del Volibol or Volleyball\\'s Cradle . It takes its name from the Acrocomia media , in Puerto Rican Spanish : palma de corozo .\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Corozal was 11,508.  \\n\nFrom 1902 to 1905 Corozal became one with Toa Alta , an adjoining municipality.  \\n\nIn 2000 census the population of Corozal was 36,867, and it had a land area of 43 sq mi (111 km 2 ).\\n\nIntense wind and rainfall from Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Corozal,   and bridges and homes were destroyed.  Some residents of Corozal had to resort to collecting spring water as access to potable water was limited after the devastation caused by the hurricane.  During the event, the police station in Corozal suddenly became flooded by the Cibuco River while there were nineteen officers inside. The officers climbed up and standing on the rooftop, made a human chain so as not to be swept away by the hurricane winds. Seeing them, several young people began a rescue operation by cutting tree limbs and debris to allow the river to subside just enough. With a firehose in hand, they waded in waters up to their necks and were able to help the officers get to dry land.  \\n\nGeography\nCorozal is located in the mountainous region near the center of the island. Quebrada Jacinta is a valley in Corozal.  \\n\nUpdated flood zone maps (as of 2019) show that Corozal is extremely vulnerable to flooding , along with Humacao , Rincón , Barceloneta , and Toa Baja . Due to its large number of rivers and streams, Corozal is regarded as being extremely vulnerable to damage from major hurricanes.  \\n\nRivers and streams of Corozal include Río Cibuco , Río Corozal , Río Dos Bocas , Río Grande de Manatí , Río Mavilla , Río Orocovis , and Río Unibón .  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Corozal is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo.\"     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English).  The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Corozal: Aldea Vázquez, Comunidad Los Indios, Cuba Libre-EI Idilio, El Guarico, La Escalera, La Mina, and\\nParcelas Medina.   \\n\nCorozal experiences a tropical climate .\\n\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Corozal page lists Reserva Natural Monte Choca , Tres Cruces , and Gran Mural de la Cultura Corozaleña , as places of interest.  \\n\nCorozal is home to the Historical Center of Cibuco , a park and museum with relics from the Puerto Rico\\'s ( Taínos ) as well as objects, paintings and artifacts of the town\\'s history.\\n\nEl Balalaika is a cafeteria which opened its doors around 1962.   \\n\nEconomy\nOne of Puerto Rico\\'s major plaintain producers.\\nNew small businesses producing eggs and hydroponic crops (lettuce, recao) are emerging.\\n\nCrafts, services.

        "page_content": "Contents\nCulebra, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nIsla Culebra  is an island, town and municipality of Puerto Rico , and together with Vieques , it is geographically part of the Spanish Virgin Islands . It is located approximately 17 miles (27 km) east of the Puerto Rican mainland, 12 miles (19 km) west of St. Thomas and 9 miles (14 km) north of Vieques . Culebra is spread over 5 barrios and Culebra Pueblo (Dewey) , the main town and the administrative center of the island. Residents of the island are known as c ulebrenses . With a population of 1,792 as of the 2020 Census, it is Puerto Rico\\'s least populous municipality.  \\n\nOriginally called Isla del Pasaje and Isla de San Ildefonso , Culebra is also known as Isla Chiquita (\"Little Island\"), Cuna del Sol Borincano (\"Cradle of the Puerto Rican Sun\") and \\xc3\\x9altima Virgen (\"Last Virgin\", due to its position at the end of the Virgin Islands archipelago).\\n\nHistory\nSome sources claim that Christopher Columbus was the first European to arrive at the island during his second voyage on November 19, 1493.    It is believed that the island was populated by Carib Indians during the colonization . After Agüeybaná and Agüeybaná II led the Taíno rebellion of 1511 , Taíno Indians from the main island sought refuge on Culebra and allied with Caribs to launch random attacks at the island estates.  \\n\nAfter that, the island was left abandoned for centuries. During the era of Spanish commerce through the Americas, it was used as a refuge for pirates , as well as local fishermen and sailors.  Some sources mention a black overseer from British-ruled Tortola named John Stevens, who was put in charge of Culebra in the 1850s by the Governor of Vieques under the Spanish crown to protect the island from foreigners who, without proper permissions or payments of fees for despoiling Culebra, took fish, cut trees for lumber and prepared drift wood as charcoal for future sale elsewhere.  Appropriating the unearned title of \"Captain\", he began a decades-long isolated sojourn on Culebra as enforcer of Spanish interests. In October 1871, however, Stevens was found dead outside his hut, his body viciously hacked apart. His heart and entrails had been placed in clay pots, in an apparent religious ritual to curse his soul. Spanish police from Vieques tracked down Tortolan foragers on Culebra who were suspected of the vicious murder. Eventually 21 of them were sentenced to forced labor on sugar plantations in Vieques as punishment. The affair caused an international incident, and, to satisfy demands from the British ambassador in Madrid , the Tortolans were finally freed by the Spanish Governor of Puerto Rico in July 1874.  \\nThese events caused the government of Switzerland in June 1876 to recall an expedition destined for Culebra to establish a warm-weather sanatorium there. Fearing further foreign encroachments, the Spanish government decided to populate Culebra with its own subjects.  \\n\nCulebra was then settled by Cayetano Escudero Sanz on October 27, 1880, when he completed his survey of the island that included subdivisions into usable lots. The Spanish government offered these parcels of land to anyone who would move to the island. The first settlers depended on rain for drinking water, as the island has no natural streams. Subsistence farming and cattle raising were established and a cistern was built for common use at one end of a natural harbor or Ensenada Honda in Spanish.\\n\nThis first settlement was called San Ildefonso , to honor the Bishop of Toledo , officially San Ildefonso de la Culebra . Two years later, on September 25, 1882, construction of the Culebrita lighthouse began. It was completed on February 25, 1886, which made it the oldest operating lighthouse in the Caribbean until 1975, when the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard finally closed the facility.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Culebra was 704.  \\n\nIn 1902, Culebra was integrated as a part of Vieques . One year later, on June 26, President Theodore Roosevelt established the Culebra Naval Reservation. A bird refuge was established on February 27, 1909.   \\n\nThe United States Navy cited the 1900 Foraker Act to expropriate the land surrounding the natural harbor and in 1902 ordered the removal of all settlers so that a base for the South Atlantic fleet could be erected. Antonio Lugo Suarez, a Puerto Rican who had made his fortune in St. Thomas then part of the Danish West Indies and Pedro Márquez Morales, a Spaniard who had married a Puerto Rican woman from Vieques, were successful ranchers on Culebra. Each offered an alternate site to the displaced Culebrenses, so as to prevent the total abandonment of the island. The location identified by Márquez on Playa Sardinas became the town of Dewey .   \\n\nA new church was built with materials taken from San Ildefonso and a customs office was constructed.  \\nPedro Márquez (1850-1920) was appointed the first mayor under U.S. rule in 1905, replacing Leopoldo Padrón, the Special Delegate appointed for the transition from Spanish rule. \\nPedro Márquez was succeeded as mayor in 1912 by his son, Alejandro Márquez Laureano (1912-1914) who erected the first docks for the new town and installed electric lighting on the town\\'s streets. He was succeeded as mayor in 1914 by Claro C. Feliciano, the first mayor who had been born in Culebra.  \\n\nWith the agreement reached with a new Cuban government to lease Guantanamo Bay as a naval base, in 1911 the U.S. reduced the size of its forces on Culebra and turned the installation to training purposes.  In 1924, the U.S. Navy began annual maneuvers on Culebra taking advantage of its deep-sea waters to practice coordinating amphibious landings on its beaches.\\n\nIn 1939, the U.S. Navy began to use the Culebra Archipelago as a gunnery and bombing practice site. This was done in preparation for the United States\\' involvement in World War II . In 1971 the people of Culebra began protests, known as the Navy-Culebra protests , for the removal of the U.S. Navy from Culebra. Four years later, in 1975, the use of Culebra as a gunnery range ceased and all operations were moved to Vieques .  \\n\nCulebra was declared an independent island municipality in 1917. The first democratically elected government was put into place in 1960. Prior to this, the government of Puerto Rico appointed delegates to administer the island.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico.  In Culebra, where Hurricane Irma had caused major damages a week prior, Hurricane Maria caused more destruction.  \\n\nGeography\nCulebra is an archipelago consisting of the main island and twenty-three smaller islands that lie off its coast. The largest of these keys are: Culebrita to the east, Cayo Norte to the northeast, and Cayo Luis Peña and Cayo Lobo to the west. The smaller islands include Cayo Ballena, Cayos Geniqui, Arrecife Culebrita, Las Hermanas, El Mono, Cayo Lobito, Cayo Botijuela, Alcarraza, Los Gemelos, and Piedra Steven. Islands in the archipelago are arid , meaning they have no rivers or streams . All of the fresh water is brought from Puerto Rico via Vieques by undersea pipeline.  \\n\nCulebra is characterized by an irregular topography resulting in a long intricate shoreline . The island is approximately 7 by 5 miles (11 by 8 km). The coast is marked by cliffs, sandy coral beaches and mangrove forests . Inland, the tallest point on the island is Mount Resaca , with an elevation of 636 feet (193.9 meters),  followed by Balcón Hill, with an elevation of 545 feet (166.1 meters).  \\n\nEnsenada Honda is the largest inlet on the island and is considered to be the most hurricane secure harbor in the Caribbean.  There are also several lagoons on the island, like Corcho, Flamenco , and Zoní . Culebrita Island also has a lagoon called Molino.\\n\nAlmost 80% of the island\\'s area is volcanic rock from the Cretaceous period. It is mostly used for livestock pasture, as well as some minor agriculture .  \\n\nThese small islands are all classified as nature reserves and several nature reserves also exist on the main island. One of the oldest bird sanctuaries in United States territory was established in Culebra on February 27, 1909, by President Teddy Roosevelt .  The Culebra Island giant anole ( Anolis roosevelti , Xiphosurus roosevelti (according to ITIS) is an extremely rare or possibly extinct anole lizard . It is native to Culebra Island and was named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt Jr. , who was the governor of Puerto Rico at that time. There are bird sanctuaries on many of the islands as well as turtle nesting sites on Culebra. Leatherback , green sea and hawksbill sea turtles use the beaches for nesting. The archipelagos bird sanctuaries are home to brown boobies , laughing gulls , sooty terns , bridled terns and noddy terns . An estimated 50,000 seabirds find their way back to the sanctuaries every year. These nature reserves comprise 1,568 acres (635 ha) of the archipelago \\'s 7,000 acres (2,800 ha). These nature reserves are protected by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service .\\n\nCulebra has no natural large mammals. However, a population of white-tailed deer introduced in July 1966 (one male and three females) can be found on the eastern region of the island.  \\n\nCulebra, along with its adjacent islets and cays, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support seabird breeding colonies of brown boobies , brown noddies , and both sooty and royal terns .  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Culebra is subdivided into barrios .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English).  The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nTourism\nCulebra is a popular weekend tourist destination for mainland Puerto Ricans , Americans and residents of Vieques .\\nCulebra has many beaches including Flamenco Beach ( Playa Flamenco ), rated third best beach in the world for 2014 by TripAdvisor . In November 2017 Forbes rated it #19 of the top 50 beaches around the world.  It can be reached by shuttle buses from the ferry. The beach extends for a mile of white coral sand and is framed beautifully by arid tree-covered hills. The beach is also protected by the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources as a marine wildlife reserve .\\n\nThe area west of Flamenco Beach and the adjacent Flamenco Point were used for joint- United States Navy / Marine Corps military exercises until 1975. Two old M4 Sherman tanks, which were used for target practice, can be found at the beach. Culebra and Vieques offered the U.S. military training areas for the Fleet Marine Force in amphibious exercises for beach landings and naval gunfire support testing. Culebra and Vieques were the two components of the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Range Inner Range. In recent years, only the shortened term \"Inner Range\" was used.\\n\nOther beaches are only accessible by private car or boats. Of the smaller islands, only Culebrita and Luis Peña permit visitors and can be accessible via water taxis from Culebra. Hiking and nature photography are encouraged on the small islands. However, activities which would disturb the nature reserves are prohibited, e.g. camping , littering and the use of motor vehicles . Camping, however, is allowed on Flamenco Beach throughout the year. Reservations are recommended.  \\nCulebra is also a popular destination for scuba divers because of the many reefs throughout the archipelago and the crystal clear waters. Because of the \"arid\" nature of the island there is no run-off from rivers or streams, resulting in very clear waters around the archipelago.\\n\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Culebra page lists Playa Flamenco , Faro de Culebrita , and Reserva Natural del Canal Luis Peña , as places of interest.  \\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , Culebra has 10 beaches.  \\n\nCulture\nCulebra celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Señora del Carmen is a religious and cultural celebration\\nin honor of Mary, the mother of Jesus and generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events include:\\n\nIn 2020, the descendants of Pedro Márquez erected a plaque commemorating the centennial of his death at the original site of his butcher shop, built on the main street that bears his name.\\n\nEconomy\nIn past centuries, agriculture was the main source of economy in Culebra. At some point, the following products were produced and exported from the island: wood , turtle oil, shells, fish, tobacco , livestock , pigs , goats , cheese , plantains , pumpkins , beans , yams , garlic , maize , tomatoes , oranges , coconut , cotton , melons , mangrove bark , coal , and turkey .  \\n\nNowadays, Culebra\\'s main source of revenue comes from construction and tourism .  \\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2020, the municipality has a population of 1,792, making it the least populous in Puerto Rico.  \\n\n10.8% of Culebra\\'s population is of non-Hispanic origin, making it also the least Hispanic municipality in Puerto Rico. This represents an increase from 2010, when only 8.3% of the population was non-Hispanic.  \\n\nIn 1894, written reports indicated that there were 519 residents living in five communities: San Ildefonso, Flamenco , San Isidero, Playa Sardinas I y II, and Frayle. There were 84 houses built, 24 of them in the San Ildefonso community.  \\n\nNotable people from Culebra\nGovernment\nLike all of Puerto Rico\\'s municipalities, the island of Culebra is administered by a mayor , elected every four years in general elections. Initially, administrators were selected by the Spanish crown or by the United States government during the 19th and early 20th century.\\n\nIn 2004, Abraham Peña Nieves was elected mayor of Culebra with 50.1% of the votes.  He was reelected in 2008.  \\n\nIn November 2011, Peña died of prostate cancer .  The next day, it was announced that his daughter, Lizaida Peña, might replace him until the 2012 general elections.  However, in 2011, Ricardo López Cepero was elected by delegates to succeed Peña. López Cepero was defeated by Iván Solís in the 2012 general election .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VIII , which is represented by two senators. In 2012, Pedro A. Rodríguez and Luis Daniel Rivera were elected as district senators.  \\n\nThe United States Postal Service operates the Culebra Post Office.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe Culebra flag consists of five vertical stripes, three alternate yellow and two green ones. The yellow central stripe has the map of Culebra in green.  \\n\nThe field is tierced in three, in the Spanish manner, vert, argent, or . The cross and the episcopal crozier symbolize Bishop San Ildefonso, because originally the island was called San Ildefonso de la Culebra . The crowned serpent ( culebra means serpent ) ondoyant in pale is the emblem of its name. The mailed arm refers to the coat of the Escudero family, first settlers of the island. The laurel cross refers to the civic triumph reached when Culebra obtained the evacuation of the United States Navy . The crest is a coronet bearing two masts, their sails filled by the wind.  \\n\nEducation\nDue to its size and small population, there are only three schools on Culebra, one for each level. They are the San Ildefonso Elementary School, the Antonio R. Barceló High School, and the Luis Muñoz Rivera school. Education is administered by the Puerto Rico Department of Education .\\n\nHealth care\nThere is a small hospital in the island called Hospital de Culebra. It also offers pharmacy services to residents and visitors. For emergencies, patients are transported by plane to Fajardo on the main island.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2020, Puerto Rico\\'s Health Department reported that in the six months of pandemic, Culebra had reported only six cases of infection and no deaths. This was the lowest rate of infection in any municipality of Puerto Rico during the COVID-19 infections .  \\n\nTransportation\nThe island of Culebra can be reached by private boat, the Culebra Ferry , or airplane . Ferry service is available from Ceiba . Ferries make several trips a day to the main island for an approximate fare of $4.50 (round trip).   \\n\nCulebra also has a small airport, Benjamín Rivera Noriega Airport , with domestic service to the mainland and Vieques . The airport is served by small airlines:\\n\nThere is public transportation available in the island, through public cars and taxis.\\n\nThere is one bridge on the island.  \\n\nNavy Culebra protests\nThe Navy-Culebra protests is the name given by American media to a series of protests starting in 1971 on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico against the United States Navy use of the island.  The protests led to the U.S. Navy abandoning its facilities on Culebra.\\n\nThe historical backdrop was that in 1902, three years after the U.S. invasion of Puerto Rico, Culebra was integrated as a part of Vieques . But on June 26, 1903, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt established the Culebra Naval Reservation in Culebra. The suitability of Culebra and its topography for the technical requirements of naval gunfire and aircraft weapons exercises was recognized in 1936, and the Government of the United States declared Culebra and its adjacent waters as the Culebra Naval Defensive Sea Area in 1941. This military defense area included all coastal waters from high-tide elevation to three miles off shore. The naval gunnery and aircraft weapons ranges at Culebra played a considerable role, along with other gunnery facilities near Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, in the combat readiness of Allied Naval Forces during the Second World War . These Caribbean ranges again served as primary weapons training grounds for both Naval Gunfire Support Exercises and aircraft weapons systems proficiency during the critical period of the Korean War starting in the summer of 1950. The United States Naval exercises reached a peak in 1969, as many ships and air units were attached to the Atlantic Fleet for gunnery and aerial ordnance proficiency prior to their ultimate assignments to naval task forces stationed in Southeast Asia .\\n\nIn 1971 the people of Culebra began the protests for the removal of the U.S. Navy from Culebra. The protests were led by Ruben Berrios , President of the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), a well-regarded attorney in international rights, President-Honorary of the Socialist International , and Law professor at the University of Puerto Rico . An ecumenical chapel was built on Flamenco Beach , in an action led by Catholic Bishop Antulio Parilla Bonilla, Baptist minister, Luis Rivera Pagán, and George Lakey of the Quaker Action Committee.  Berrios and other protesters squatted in Culebra for a few days. Some of them, including Berrios, were arrested and imprisoned for civil disobedience . The official charge was trespassing on U.S. military territory. The protests led to the U.S. Navy discontinuing the use of Culebra as a gunnery range in 1975 and all of its operations were moved to Vieques. The case against the Navy was led by Washington lawyer Richard Copaken as retained pro-bono by the people of Culebra island.\\n\nThe cleaning process of the island has been slow. At the end of 2016, the United States Army Corps of Engineers sent letters to the residents of Culebra citing active removal of undetonated explosive material still present on the island.  \\n\nIn popular culture\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nDorado, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nDorado  is a town and municipality on the northern coast of Puerto Rico , 15 miles (24 km) west of San Juan and is located in the northern region of the island, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, north of Toa Alta , east of Vega Alta , and west of Toa Baja . Dorado is subdivided into five barrios and Dorado Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . During the early 18th century, there were already mentions of a \"Sitio de Dorado\" (meaning a golden place) in some San Juan registers.  Since the beginning of the Spanish colonial period and until 1831, Dorado existed as a barrio (or ward ) of the town of Toa Baja . Over several years, the ward grew and established its own town center called the \"new pueblo\" to differentiate itself from Toa Baja, which became known as the \"old pueblo.\" Over several years, the barrios that currently make up Dorado grew and the people of the \"new pueblo\" wanted to separate themselves from Toa Baja.\\n\nOn November 22, 1842, Jacinto López Martínez, the Sergeant at Arms for the ward of Dorado, petitioned the Spanish Governor of Puerto Rico , Santiago Méndez Vigo, to establish the municipality of Dorado. The governor authorized the founding of the town pending the construction of public works, including an administrative building and a church near the town square. In 1848, the construction of the public works were completed and López Martínez became the first mayor of Dorado. Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1902, four years after the Spanish-American War , Dorado was again appended to Toa Baja. But in 1905 it regained its status as a separate town. Nowadays, Dorado has upscale neighborhoods and a small downtown area with a plaza (main town square ), as other Puerto Rican municipalities. The town\\'s patron saint is Anthony of Padua , and patron saint celebrations are held at the plaza every year on June 13.\\n\nHistory\nThe region adjacent Toa river (modern day La Plata river) was inhabited by several indigenous groups that left behind physical proof of their presence in the region.  The area surrounding the Toa river was scouted by Juan Ponce de León during his initial reconnaissance of the geography of the main island.  Near it, the Conquistadores built some huts in which to rest.  However, citing \"difficulties\" with the region, the Spaniards opted to move to the region that would eventually become Caparra, the colonial Spanish capital of San Juan Bautista (the original Spanish name for Puerto Rico).  During the beginning of the Spanish colonization, the area known as Toa was ruled by Taíno cacique (a title akin to Chief) Aramaná, who controlled the regions comprising Punta Salinas to Cibuco river (modern day Toa Baja through Vega Baja).  After Agüeybana I (a title akin to High Chief or king) entered in association with the Spanish conquistadors through the guaytiao he became known as Francisco de Aramaná, also being recognized as a Don .  Now technically as politically influential as Agüeybana due to the ceremony, the Spanish were able to include the lower ranking caciques, including Aramaná, in the encomiendas system and placed several in charge of royal farms and mining operations near Toa river.  The region proved production both in agriculture and mining and an assimilation process began between both cultures.  Ponce de León himself created Hacienda del Rey and requested the creation of a new conuco near Toa river, which was later sold to Pedro Ortiz.  The conquistador also built other properties that he later sold to other Spaniards.  Around 500 Taínos worked under the caciques in the area.  \\n\nOral tradition claims that a Spaniard named Juan González somehow survived long enough after being severely injured in the initial Taíno offensive of the Spanish-Taíno War of San Juan-Borikén to reach the region of Toa and warn the conquistadores.  Ten years after the beginning if the colonization, more than 17 estates were built in the region, with harvests being transported through the Toa river to Palo Seco and to the Capital from there.  After Ponce de León transferred Hacienda del Rey to other Spaniards, the estate steadily declined and by 1524 denounces were made about its state.  As more Spanish families settled, problems between neighbors arose, prompting Francisco de Negrete to request that a mayor was assigned to the region in 1611.  However, it is not until 1731 that ra mayor, Juan Dávila, appears in the records.  During the following decades, more than 24 mayors would serve office, with military officers taking prominence beginning in the 1740s.  \\n\nOn September 11, 1627, San Juan\\'s council ordered the creation of a ship route between Bayamón and Toa, giving control of the rent to the council of the first city.  From here, the rest of the route was traversed on horseback.  On the way from the Capital to the central north coast, two passages were encountered, the Palo Seco and the Boca Hababa river.  After crossing the second, a rest area was built in modern-day Barrio Mameyal.  With an increase in traffic, the inhabitants of the town of Toa saw business opportunities and began joining the local fishermen, steadily creating a small settlement.  By the first half of the 18th century, the locale was already known as \"Dorado\", \"Boca del Dorado\" or \"Alto del Dorado\" and referred to as such in official documentation.  The municipality of Toa Baja was founded either in 1745.  Other sources place the foundation taking place in 1747. With this development, the region became part of it.  The Santa Hermandad mayor would then become municipal mayor.  By 1748, the Settler Captain was George García Páes.  In February 1761, there was a conflict between the overseer of the Boca Havana passage, Cayetano Quiñones, and the local fishermen in which the location became relevant.  The control and lent of these passages remained in contention during the following century, with the San Juan council refereeing similar issues.  \\n\nTowards the 18th century\\'s end and entering the 19th century, the municipality had become a hub for sugar plantations led by Spanish hacendados and slavers, who exploited an international need for sugar caused by the Haitian revolution to export it and derivatives like rum while also meeting local demands.  Other crops were also grown, but no priority was given to them.  The end of the Napoleonic wars and the elimination of some taxes allowed a new generation of hacendados from the capital of San Juan to benefit from the booming industry, among the mayors Jacinto López Martínez and José Canales.  However, the roads that lead to Western Puerto Rico crossed through el Dorado and this, combined with flooding concerns, did not allow the municipality to develop a proper urban center, with Palo Seco being its main commerce epicenter.  By 1820, Dorado itself was as big as the municipal town and the crisis lead to a proposal of relocating the municipal town there being presented to colonial governor Miguel de la Torre by hacendados with ties to him during a visit.  On October 20, 1824, the move was authorized, but it stalled due to opposition from the settlers.  However, this same year a hurricane named Santa Ana ravaged and flooded the municipal town, causing the death of people and cattle, accelerating the process.  The following years, the construction of a royal house and a church had begun at Dorado.  During this time, Toa Baja\\'s mayor José Marí Ramírez de Arellano requested moving the boat access point near the entry of Dorado to a more accessible location, avoiding dangerous body of waters in the process, which was later conceded by the council of San Juan.  However, the free transit to Dorado for the neighbors of the municipal town of Toa Baja was attended afterwards, despite being part of the initial request.  By 1829, the local militias and the justice offices were relocated as well.  However, entering the following decades the dissidents of the move led by mayor José Manuel de Córdova extra officially forced the return of the municipal institutions and returned them to Toa Baja, claiming lack of proper maintenance.  Despite this, Dorado continued growing as the traffic of people traversing through the royal road rose.  By 1832, a teacher named José Viada was teaching the local children.  The settlement eventually earned the nickname of \"Pueblo Nuevo\" to differentiate it from Toa Baja (\"Pueblo Viejo\").  \\n\nWith the plantations led by administrators, the flourish in the sugar industry continued until 1840, when the market entered in a crisis and the price if products crashed, leaving the region with a declining industry.  In 1839, Palo Seco opted to become a separate municipality.  On March 10, 1841, colonial governor Santiago de Méndez Vigo authorized moving all the administrative offices from Dorado to Toa Baja, faced by pressure from the settlers.  Consequently, former mayor and hacendado Jacinto López Martínez, who had employed his friendship with De la Torre to acquire local terrains between 1813 and 1835, proposed creating a separate municipality by the name of El Dorado to secure his wealth by acquiring the title of Settlement Captain.  In a reunion with friends and family, he formalized this request.  The justification was based in the population growth in Dorado and adjacent barrios and possessing enough resources to sustain itself separately.  In arrangements that took place on July 27, 1841, in San Juan, López was joined by José de Folgueras as prospective beneficiaries if the move and his proposal was supported by Manuel Canales, Celedonio Nevárez, Juan P. Nevárez, Domingo López, Andrés Martínez, Florencio Sánchez, José M. López, Ignacio Arrazaín and Ignacio Cordero, who offered to build the buildings necessary to sustain the town.  The official request took place shortly afterwards, with the governor requesting feedback from the municipality of Toa Baja after being counseled to do so.  After more than a month, the reply contained strong opposition to the separation, heavily criticizing the capacities of those involved in the request citing personal ambitions as a motive and claiming that the lands were unproductive, that the area was plagued with environmental factors that \"resulted in the early death\" of its residents and that the water was unclean.  The rebuttal also claimed that the barrios pushing for separation were unable too poor to sustain the public workings of a town, despite being the ones that contributed most to the fisco up to this point, the purported lack of personnel and a workforce or that the proximity of the settlements would be unlawful.  After being given copies of Toa Baja\\'s opposition, López and Folgueras requested that the complaints were dismissed and questioned the accuracy of any of the counterarguments, also opting to criticize that some of the proponents were being targeted for being poor, which should not prevent them from entering association.  The group also labelled Toa Baja as a failed municipality by using its iwn criteria, responding that the criticism for lack of a workforce was unfair since despite its age the town faced similar problems.  \\n\nPublic hearings were then proposed and accepted by the colonial governor.  The process was assigned to Commander Miguel Delgado, who left to Toa Baja accompanied by witnesses Plácido de Cabrera and Juan M. Feijoó.  The following day, March 10, 1842, the preliminary preparations began.  Only 14 of the 120 available testified in the hearings, which were interviewed about their residence in Dorado and expressed favor for the creation of a municipality.  [ a ] Delgado also supervised the status of progression in the construction of a Catholic church.  On March 13, 1842, a process to interview the opponents at Toa Baja, who had since stepped our from authority, began and extended for three days.  Afterwards, Delgado returned to San Juan with a report for the governor favoring the establishment of a new municipality due to favorable conditions and military potential and discarding proximity as a factor, since Camuy and Hatillo were already proximate.  Méndez Vigo delegated the issue to an aid, Anacleto Buelta, who suggested interviewing the current Toa Baja administration and argued inconsistencies in witness selection.  Delgado died suddenly shortly afterwards.  Buelta then recommended beginning a new process again in Toa Baja, which the colonial governor conceded and assigned the task to councilor Domingo García.  On May 28, 1842, he left the capital accompanied by witnesses Plácido de Cabrera and Eusebio de Cabrera.  The second set of hearings began on June 1, 1842, in the town hall of Toa Baja, which assigned a commission to oversee the process, with several of the previous deponents ratifying their previous statements and 23 inhabitants of Dorado supporting the request for separation, with the remainder being forced to attend subsequent hearings by the local court.  All ratified their previous support except five, who felt that they would be forced to work in the church, a job that they had left at Toa Baja.  The only exceptions, according to the rural mayors of Dorado and Maguayo, were either sick or absent.  The Toa Baja Commission, represented by mayor Juan Landrón an overseer and the municipal secretary, proposed that only proprietors, those that paid subsidies, should be consulted, considering the declarations of those that didn\\'t useless and potentially damaging to those that did.  The municipal government also opposed the declarations of no -resident proponents, those that weren\\'t family heads or that had any connection with the main proponents, accompanied by a list of people that they considered ineligible.  \\n\nOn June 4, 1842, Landrón submitted a list of people that were considered eligible by his administration, including residents from barrios that were not initially interested in the action.  This same day, opposition hearings were held where the administration if Toa Baja presented its case, with López and Folgueras serving as witnesses.  A total of 91 neighbors from these barrios attended, with the opinions regarding the foundation of Dorado being in favor of the opposition 125-8, without counting a number of indifferent attendees.  Hearing concluded on June 9, 1842, with a relevant report being completed the same day.  Like the first, it was delegated to an aide.  Two days later, López addressed the colonial governor requesting a copy of the aide\\'s conclusion, citing the suspicion that the municipality of Toa Baja had used ineligible witnesses to dilate the process.  Shortly afterwards, López impugned the declarations of opposing witnesses, noting that most did not live near the proposed municipality and that others simply wanted to avoid paying more to the government, requesting statistics of paying inhabitants of Dorado with which to argue that they were capable of sustaining a new town.  On August 12, 1842, the proponents sent a recount of the process and requested that the colonial governor authorized the founding of Dorado, printing the aid to request the opinion of the Toa Baja administration.  On September 8, 1842, the municipal government once again opposed the separation.  After receiving it, aide Melitón Belanzathegui recommended proceeding with the foundation of a new municipality, with Méndez Vigo authorizing the creation of San Antonio del Dorado on November 22, 1842.  The government made demands guaranteeing the construction of several building, towards which López placed his own properties as collateral.  The founders also requested to begin the process to assign or elect relevant authority figures, all of which were granted.  The colonial governor also named López Settler Captain and ordered that all buildings were completed within a year and a half.  The demarcation process was initially overseen by Pedro García with the help of Julio O\\'Neill of the Bayamón Department with Carlos Vuagneaux taking charge following a suspención due to weather, and began on January 10, 1843, extending for six days.  The cost of establishing the new municipality ascended 4,196 pesos with 20 cents.  Despite the founding of a number of schools, the education in the new municipality was troubled by the instability in the permanency of teachers appointed by the Catholic Church.  \\n\nDuring this time, there were around 17 high class residences in the municipality, while the working class lived in wood huts.  Depending on an agricultural economy, there were several hundred African slaves working in the Spanish haciendas of Dorado.  On March 6, 1843, there was a slave uprising in the hacienda of Francisco Cantero, who after being received by gunfire in the Catholic Church in Toa Baja, fled to the sugar plantations of Dorado, where the government captured them and sentenced several to death.  Despite royal decrees prohibiting the traffic of African slaves, the Spaniards continued illegally importing them, with Dorado mayor José Carreras actively participating in the trade.  However, the salve population was severely hit by a cholera epidemic, and two years later the colonial government confiscated a ship property of Carreras was confiscated due to its suspected links with the activity.  Consternation in the colonial authorities lead to the slaves being permitted to file complaints before the Municipal Sindico Receiver.  A predominantly Catholic culture also brought another phenomenon, in which repentant slave owners set them free as part if their last will.  Other work sources, like corral fishing, required permission first from the council of San Juan and later from the municipal administration.  \\n\nBy 1848, the municipality of Dorado was running all of its functions under López, now mayor and War Lieutenant and in charge of filling several reports related to the population, wealth and agricultural production.  Afterwards, the mayor would be elected by the governor from a pool of three candidates selected by the municipality\\'s elite and only served a maximum of two years.  During this time, the economy was dependent on 9 sugar haciendas and 54 cattle estates.  The industry in question was dominated by López himself, Manuel Skerrett, Francisco Cantero, José Marrero, Carlos Vassallo, Miguel Torrens, Juan P. Nevárez, Florencio Salgado, and the inheritors of María E. Martínez.  Being located in the Camino Real (Royal Highway) grocery and other types of stores were run by people like Antonio Solé, Benito Carreras, and Juana Sánchez and brothers.  These types of businesses continued flourishing for the following decades.  By 1859, there were 179 farms in Dorado.  López, Salgado and others also created brick and lime powder factories.  At the First Public Exposition of Industry, Agriculture and Arts, Lechet demonstrated his advances in processing white sugar, which earned him a silver commendation from the Secretary of the Royal Commerce Board, Andrés Viña.  In the third edition of this event, a Dorado factory won the gold award for a variety if products.  \\n\nOn March 19, 1850, the municipality was reclassified as a Second Class Mayorship.  On August 4, 1860, Toa Baja mayor Manuel Aguayo proposed the merger of Dorado into Toa Baja, which was opposed by Dirado mayor Pablo A. Dueño and his administration.  A month later the proposal was dropped by the colonial governor.  Upon his death in 1862, López himself left money for his slaves.  His inheritors failed to preserve the terrains that were received from him.  In 1870, a group of four slaves -named Manuel Díaz, Juan Pedro, Juan D. Epifanio and Benito- killed the butler of hacienda La Monserrate, Manuel M. Sampayo Saldaña, who had developed a reputation for the eating the violently.  For this act, the colonial government executed them on September 26, 1870.  The event would become part of Dorado\\'s oral tradition.  Despite drop in the local price of slaves, some residents of Cuba would buy slaves and export them to that island where the price was rising.  In 1872, an incident involving a Frenchman named José Beaupied lead to the slaver being intervened and losing the four children of a slave that he had bought, but she was transferred to Dorado and with the help of a fellow Frenchman and later committed suicide.  The event was controversial and lead to the local British ambassador, H. August Cowper, protesting the moving if slaves between the islands before the Spanish crown.  Telegraph lines were placed in 1870, connecting Dirado to several municipalities and remaining in service for more than a century.  \\n\nAs abolition became impending, several entities including Sucesión de Torrens, Sobrinos de Arrazaín and Skerret y Hermanos joined individuals such as Ambrosio Martorell and released their slaves pro bono.  For thus action, they were commended by the Spanish Crown on April 26, 1873.  In total, the abolition granted freedom to 402 slaves in Dorado.  Oral tradition claims that the freed celebrated until midnight, when a thunderstorm suddenly appeared and during which the tomb of Sampayo was struck by lightning.  A series of earthquakes in late 1867 damaged buildings in Dorado, particularly the Catholic Church.  In 1872, local instruction was placed in charge of José Iglesias and six years later the situation began improving.  In 1884, José D. Félix and Pedro M. Agüeeo founded private schools, which attended an interest of the higher classes to educate their children.  Entering the next decade, there were six public schools and several hundred children being educated.  However, the elementary system was troubled, with only two schools classified as Second Class by the government.  By this time there were more than 200 houses in the urban area of Dorado and over 270 families.  \\n\nDorado remained a poor municipality throughout the 19th century and the 1873 agricultural crisis exacerbated its issues to the point that towards 1897 was unable to pay debts that had been accumulating for nearly 30 years.  During this crisis, several of the hacendados were forced to mortgage their haciendas, incurring in large debts that lead to some losing them.  On July 20, 1870, the annexation to Toa Baja was proposed by conservatives, but failed to proceed.  Early during this decade, there were seven businesses that paid subsidies, while during the second half there were some 14 businesses.  On June 10, 1873, the municipality of Dorado requested permission to widen and deepen the La Plata river mouth to allow larger ships to enter in an attempt to reinvigorate the sugar industry.  However, a prolonged draught seriously affected the crops and combined with the payment that was now given to former slaves, the situation quickly declined.  \\n\nJacinto López II became mayor in 1875, holding the office until the year of his death nine years later, but despite this influence debt made him lose the terrains that once belonged to his father to the colonial government.  The budgets were not satisfactory, but Dorado received the control of the passage of La Plata, which it rented.  However, the passage soon became a point of contention between those that wanted to oversee it and the municipality, including a failed 1878 litigation presented to the colonial governor himself during a visit.  By this year, there were only seven steam powered sugar mills working in the municipality.  \\n\nOn March 8, 1891, the train track connecting Dorado to Manatí and Martín Peña were inaugurated.  The passenger train would operate until the 1940s.  A sales tax was imposed to try and counter the crisis in 1895, but within a year the abolition of Dorado as a municipality was considered.  The final decade of the century borough forth a sugar renaissance, growing to 11 haciendas which were complemented by a coffee estate.  By 1893, there were 229 farms, with seven totaling more than half of the terrains with Pablo Ubarri being the dominant owner.  As consequence of the Spanish-American War , Dorado was placed in charge of the colonial American government on October 11, 1898.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Dorado was 3,804.  \\n\nThis change in sovereignty resulted in several of the local haciendas being systematically redistributed between Americans such as R.S. Brown, William W. Miner and corporations like Y.P.R. Fruit Land Co. and Finlay Waymouth and Lee, Inc. during the following decade.  Ubarri\\'s terrains were fragmented and part of it ended being owned by Afred Livingston and his daughter Clara.  The Parraoquial House was seized by the colonial government and in 1922 the municipality turned it into an emergency building.  \\n\nElections for municipal offices began being held on January 16, 1900.  The results were certified by representative of the colonial government, Lt. Woodson Hocker.  By 1902, there were six schools in Dorado.  These institutions would later be staffed by Doradeños that graduated from the University of Puerto Rico, completed by other locals.  With time, some families would dedicate to instruction.  By the second decade of the century, Escuela Jacinto López Martínez and Segunda Unidad de Maguayo were built to accommodate the increasing school age population, with the first being created at the behest of mayor Heraclio López Canino.  \\n\nAlfredo López would take the office of mayor from his father and begin a series of urban development projects.  The following two decades, Pedro López Canino and two rural schools were built.  Near it, the Escuela Ricardo Arroyo Laracuente served as middle school.  In 1952, Manuel Morales García was elected as mayor.  In 1964, a local high school was built so that local children did not have to travel to Toa Baja, the following decade it was renamed after local attorney José S. Alegría.  \\n\nPedro López Canino served as mayor taking over the municipal administration when Dorado\\'s budget was merely $3,000, with this sum ascending to $18,000 by the 1920s.  The first telephone lines were placed in 1910 and operators were employed until the 1960s.  That same year, the Puerto Rico Power and Light Co. installed electrical lines.  \\n\nNew stores were founded early in this century, including El Siglo XX and Salgado y Pérez, both of which ceased to exist during the first half of the century.  The first gas station in Dorado was founded by Ramón Pérez, who also created the Dorada Bus Line.  Milk and ice were also distributed.  Maritime and fresh water fishers were responsible for providing fresh fish and several would later become part of Dorado\\'s oral tradition.  During the 1950s, the Dorado Fishing Club introduced sport fishing to the municipality.  \\n\nUltimately, Dorado was annexed to Toa Alta in 1902, when the Puerto Rico legislature ordered the move due to its economic woes.  In March 1905, the same entity reversed the move.  By 1920, 177 farms remained, with a sharp decline in mid-sized and small properties.  Three years after the death of Alfred Livingston in 1923, the government reclaimed Mata Redonda farm since it had been acquired illegally, but after being repelled with armed resistance during the impending, the case was seen by the colonial Federal Court, which failed in favor of Clara Livingston.  With the foreign interests, cultivation of sugar rose and reached 400 square meters (a unit known in Spanish as \"cuerda\") of land, but coffee stopped being produced.  Other fruits began increasing production during the 1940s.  Most of the population was dependent on the opportunities offered by the agricultural entities, which lead to a pronounced unemployment rate.  To counter this, the worker\\'s union donated the building where the Dorado Hand Craft factory was established, operating for two decades.  New aqueducts and a sewer system replaced a well based system during 1948-50.  In 1936, a new bridge crossing La Plata river was inaugurated.  \\n\nDuring the 1940s, there was widespread construction of public and private housing to accommodate a series of government reforms.  Among these was El Pueblo del Niño, a refuge for children.  In 1947, the municipal assembly adopted the official map of Dorado that was proposed with the barrios of Higuillar, Maguayo, Espinosa, Mameyal and Río Lajas.  \\n\nIn 1953, a widespread fire destroyed 11 houses, with its residents being relocated to new homes provided by charity.  This precipitated the creation of a local fire station in 1956.  The end of the Korean War lead to another urbanization wave.  The construction of private project Urbanización Martorell resulted in several Doradeños returning to settle the houses.  This tendency continued during the following three decades, with middle and high class projects being built.  In 1957, a road was built between Dorado and Palo Seco.  \\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Dorado continued producing sugar, fruits and cattle, but there was a continued decline in the presence of small and mid-sized properties.  However, by this time Finlay Waymouth and Lee, Inc. disappeared.  Wealthy families, both local and American, continued acquiring the terrains of Dorado.  During the 1950s, an economic shift lead to the virtual disappearance of the sugar industry and the terrains were repurposed for cattle.  Clara Livingston sold her terrains to the Rickefelker family, who turned them into two hotels, Dorado Beach and Cerromar.  Late in the decade, Dorado created a Municipal Library, located in the old emergency building.  \\n\nStores such as La Vencedora and La Favorita were founded during this time, operating during the following decades.  In 1972, Alfonso López Chaar was elected mayor with a platform based on sports and culture.  Dorado became the first municipality to adopt the landfill system.  The 2nd G7 summit was held at the Dorado Beach Resort between June 27 and 28, 1976.  \\n\nCasa del Rey, which after being acquired from the government by López had served as the house of several people and a political center, was restored by the municipality and the ICP during the second half of the 20th Century.  In 1985, the municipal administration began a restoration and redevelopment project named Dorado 2000 prior to the celebration of Dorado\\'s 150th Anniversary.  When Alfonso López Chaar left the office of mayor to become Secretary of State in 1987, his successor Carlos López became the youngest mayor in Puerto Rico at that point at the age of 29.  In 1988 the Committee on the Quality of Life of a Puerto Rico recognized the municipality as first in their life quality rankings.  The municipality revalidated and was included into the entity\\'s hall of fame.  In 1989, Hurricane Hugo made landfall in Puerto Rico and caused heavy damages to the municipality.  By the 1990s, Dorado del Mar had closed, with Cerromar and Dorado Beach continuing their function.  In 1991, a reforestation initiative named Dorado Siembra was implanted.  That same year the ICP named the town\\'s cultural program a \"cultural model\".  \\n\nOn January 6, 1992, floods destroyed the La Plata bridge.  That same year, the administration of Dorado held concurrent Fifth Centenary and municipal anniversary events.  The Dorado Airport was operated from 1942 to 1996. The airport began as a military landing strip, then became a civilian airport in the 1960s with Caribair and Dorado Wings flights operating until 1980 and 1982 respectively. The airport operated as a private landing strip throughout the 1980s and then fell into disrepair. In 1996, the airport was rezoned as residential land and redeveloped.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Dorado, 1,175 homes were left without a roof and 625 homes were destroyed.  \\n\nIn mid 2018, the United States Army Corps of Engineers announced it would be undertaking a major flood control project of a river that often causes flooding in Dorado, Río de la Plata .  \\n\nIn 2012, the Luis Fortuño administration passes broad tax incentives for foreigners through Acts 20 and 22 (later consolidated into Act 60-2019), which included 0% on capital gains and a 4% corporate rate. Some areas became favored by the individuals that arrived to Puerto Rico to benefit, including Dorado Beach where mansions and villas sold in the 20-30 million range.  The price of property in Dorado rose 66% between 2016 and 2019.  With the turn of the decade more foreigners have moved to Dorado Beach, including Kevin Thobias and Logan Paul .  \\n\nGeography\nDorado is located in Puerto Rico\\'s Northern Karst region. Much of its geology consists of alluvial and coastal/estuarine sediments of Quaternary age and limestones of Tertiary age.  The limestones are mostly in the south part of the municipality, in Espinosa , Maguayo and Rio Lajas barrios. These limestones exhibit mature karst topography of great beauty. It has been subjected to extensive quarrying , which have left unsightly scars in the landscape. Some local communities have gathered efforts to minimize quarrying and improve land management to protect the remaining karst topography and the fauna and flora that lives in it. Around 95% of Dorado\\'s terrain are flood plains while the rest is part of a limestone region.  The terrains are naturally fertilized when the Dorado, Plata and Lajas rivers go out of their limits.  The rock formation known as Ojo de Buey is tourist attraction, also being associated with legends of ghosts and the claim that the pirate captain Roberto Cofresí \\'s treasure is buried near it.  \\n\nSome of the rivers of Dorado are:\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Dorado is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .    \\n\nSome of the municipality\\'s barrios are named after the name of its inhabitants or taíno names, even the region itself may have been taken from the last name of an early Spanish settler.  Examples of this are Espinosa and Maguayo  Others such as Higuilar, Mameyal, Marismillas and Río Lajas are named after flora or geographical features.  \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.  \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Dorado: El Caño, Kuilan Barrio Espinosa, La Hormiga, Sector Calondrias, Sector El Cotto, Villa 2000, Villa Iriarte, and Villa Plata.  \\n\nDorado has a tropical climate that is very hot in the summer months and warm in the winter. Temperatures range around 60 to 80 °F (16 to 27 °C) in the winter and 75 to 95 °F (24 to 35 °C) in the summer.\\n\nCulture\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Dorado page lists Sala de exposiciones del plata Salvador Rivera Cardona , Plaza Conmemorativa 5th Centenario , and Balneario Manuel \"Nolo\" Morales , as places of interest.  \\n\nDorado\\'s cultural activities feature all of the traditional Puerto Rican elements, but focus on African and Spanish elements.  Taíno elements are more conspicuous and mostly influence the food.  Popular culture is promoted, which is represented by a number of interpreters such as Juan Boria, Joe Valle and Horacio Olivo.  Local painters include José Bernandino and Marcos J. Alegría.  In the early 20th century the Rockefeller family purchased plots of land in the northwest region of the municipality of Dorado where they built a huge private vacation compound. Laurance Rockefeller would later use this land to create Dorado Beach Hotel and Golf Club, which later became the Dorado Beach Hyatt Hotel which closed in 2007. Dorado Beach Hotel became a Ritz Carlton hotel in 2012, which got the top spot in the 2019 Conde Naste Readers\\' Choice.  \\n\nDorado has long been known as a golf haven. Its tourist industry includes the Dorado Beach Resort (Ritz-Carlton Reserve & Plantation), the Hyatt Hacienda del Mar, and Embassy Suites in the Dorado Del Mar neighborhood. As of 2014 there are three operating golf courses in the municipality, the Dorado Beach East Course, the Plantation Sugarcane Course and the Plantation Pineapple Course. The Dorado del Mar course closed in 2014.\\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , Dorado has 24 beaches, including Balneario Manuel Nolo Morales .  \\n\nSome of the places to visit in Dorado are located downtown . For example, the Museum Casa del Rey is the house built in most towns controlled by Spain during their colonization, which was intended for the King and Queen to stay if they visited. The museum includes several artifacts from the era. There\\'s also the Distinguished Doradeños Square, and the Juan Boria Theater. The last one was recently reopened after a long period of restoration.\\n\nSome of the most visited beaches in Dorado are Sardinera, Kikita and El Unico are other beaches frequented by surfers . The Ojo del Buey Park is a park located at the base level of the La Plata River . The name comes from a rock formation that has the shape of an ox . The Dorado Pterocarpus Forest is also located in the municipality.  \\n\nDorado also has a church called the Sanctuary of Christ of the Reconciliation, that has the third largest statue of Jesus Christ in the Caribbean , inside its temple. Christmas celebrations extend throughout the season and into epiphany, prior to them the Strenna Mass is held and on Christmas Eve, the Misa de Gallo takes place.  Folk traditions tied to these events include the sprinkling of sugar in houses to receive the new year, a practice where a man dresses as a representation of the old year with which residents have fun or release their frustrations for the fading year and trulla parties in which people dressed as the Three Wise Men and a vigil where music is played to celebrate the epiphany.  As in the rest of Puerto Rico, this is followed by another period of celebration due to the octavas and octavitas.\\n\nAccording to oral tradition, the Fiestas a la Santa Cruz have been celebrated since the municipality\\'s foundation.  Dorado also celebrates fiestas patronales to honor Antonio de Padua, which retain their religious origins but have included cultural activities such as trova contests, the coronation of a queen and La Alborada.  During these, the municipality also celebrates a Day of the Absent Doradeños, in which those abroad visit and join a celebration in their name.  Other days are dedicated to exemplary mothers and adopted citizens (the official title of \"Adoptive Son\" is given during these).  General recreation activities include horse races, carny attractions, sack races, climbing competitions and eating contests among others.  A variety of traditional food and sweets are also served.  Prior to Lent, a carnival is hosted, although the religious significance of the date has since been phased out beyond the interaction of the Vejigantes, La Muerte en Cueros and the Negritos (a Christian allegory with pagan elements depicting tormenting demons and death as the great equalizer in relation to sinners represented by the Negritos, taking away the enjoyment of the demons) and now host other cultural elements.  The Catholic practices attributed to Lent are widely practiced, along local ones such as preserving palm branches from Palm Sunday as a practice to ward off ill wishes and bad luck.  Processions are celebrated during Easter week.  \\n\nDorado celebrates its patron saint festival in June. The Fiestas Patronales de San Antonio de Padua is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as Raphy Leavitt , Ismael Miranda , and Pedro Capó .  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Dorado include:\\n\nAs a historically industrial town, the academic culture is mostly centered around writer José S. Alegría and poet Ferdinand R. Cestero is honored for employing the municipality as part of his pseudonym.  A Cultural Center supported by the ICP was founded in 1967, with the municipal Office of Cultural Affairs promoting these aspects begging during the 1980s.  The first local poet was Société D\\'Emulation award winner Camille Schwingrouber.  Former president of the Ateneo Puertorriqueño Ferdinand R. Cestero wrote Dorado, pueblito áureo y ensiñador... to honor the municipality.  Son of former mayor Cruz Alegría, José S. Alegría was born in Dorado on July 17, 1886, and went on to direct Puerto Rico Illustrado magazine and write several books.  He was also a painter, being instructed by Francisco Oller.  His son, Ricardo Alegría, later became one of the most influential cultural figures in Puerto Rico.  Beginning in the 1970s, Pablo Maysonet began publishing several books.  The Dorado Writers and Friends of Literature Circle was founded to promote literature, but ceased functioning by 1989.  A local newspaper was first published in 1903, when El Hijo del Combate circulated.  The Dorado Society of Archeological Investigations was founded in 1983 and is tasked with the archeological material at Museo Casa del Rey.  \\n\nUntil the 1930s, weekly bomba dances were held in Calle Norte and Calle Sur.  These were later preserved by the plena groups of Dorado.  Other folkloric arts groups included Los Batá, Ballet Folklórico Arawak, Ballet Folklórico Amaná and other municipal and community groups.  During the 1950s the municipal band and a Luteran band were created.  A school band combined the high school and middle school students during the 1970s.  The Meléndez brothers, Manuel and Eleuterio, were Dorado\\'s first professional musicians.  Carmen Meléndez, daughter of the second later taught piano in the municipality.

During the 1960s, Germán Jímenez composed a number of vals and danzas.  Marcos J. Alegría was the municipality\\'s first career painter.  During the 1970s, the José S. Alegría school began teaching dramatic arts at the behest of Laura Iglesias.  During the 1980s, a theatre named Teatro Juan Boria and  an arts school named Academia de Arte Dramático Aramaná were created, along a municipal theatre group.  Other plastic artists that followed in his footsteps were Jaime Rivera, Marco A. Alegría, Jesús Cardona, Luis R. Nieves, Salvador Rivera and Basilio Cardona.  In 1919, Cine Juana de Arco was founded.  \\n\nDespite producing some athletes, sports were not widely promoted until the foundation of the intermunicipal Olimpiadas del Plata during the 1970s.  The formal events include a marathon held in November.  Paso Fino , an indigenous sport, has been among the most practiced, with the Kuilan family gaining prominence due to it.  Francisco Kuilan is a second generation rider and won competitions held locally and internationally in places like Paris, where he won a non-Paso Fino competition with a horse named Dulce Sueño in a tour sponsored by Félix Benítez Rexach .

Companies like Boston Scientific , Pfizer and Heraeus are among some of the ones located in the city.\\n\nIn recent years, Dorado has been known for its development of upscale neighborhoods. Several known politicians and artists (e.g. Ricky Martin , Carlos Romero Barceló ) live or own properties in the city.\\n\nDemographics\nDorado\\'s population has steadily increased during the past century. According to the 2000 census, the population consist of 34,017 with a population density of 1,479.0 people per square mile (571.0 people/km 2 ) more than doubling the town\\'s population of 17,388 in 1970. The 2020 census indicated the first decline (6%) since the U.S. census has been carried out on the island. According to the 2020 census the town has a population of 35,879.\\n\nAs a whole, Puerto Rico is populated mainly by people from a Criollo (born on the island of Spanish descent) or European descent, with small groups of African and Asian descent. Statistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 74.1% of Doradeños identify with Spanish or White origin, 12.2% identify as black , and 0.5% as Amerindian .\\n\nAs of 2000, speakers of English as a first language accounted for 16.89% of the population.  \\n\n\\n\nDue to the influence of Spanish culture, a majority of Dorado\\'s population still practices Catholicism. There are two religious patrons, the Virgen del Rosario and Antonio Abad.  Esteban Mariani was placed in charge of the Dorado Parish on June 29, 1848.  Since then, several priests served the function until Salvador Carratala was charged in 1925.  Afterwards, the Dominican Fathers took over in 1927 and held the office until Salvador Pujolas\\' one-year stint in 1930.  The following year, the Augustinian Fathers took over until handling it to the Congregation of the Mission in 1937.  The following year, José Delgado was tasked with the parish until the Holy Spirit Fathers took over in 1943.  \\n\nThe Getsemaní Lutheran Church was founded on July 25, 1911.  Initially ran by foreign ministers, until Demetrio Texidor consecrated a temple in August 1924.  On December 30, 1945, Carlos Torres became the first officially installed reverend serving the office for 5 years, after years of the office being distributed between locals and foreigners.  During the following years, the entity continued its expansion plans under Miguel Sevilla.  In 1954, Victor Astacio took over and under him the Church hosted its first synod of the Caribbean event.  In 1961, Gilberto Falcón took over and began a project to construct a new temple with the old one hosting its last service on July 19, 1964.  Rafael Malpica Padilla, a Doradeño, also served as reverend.  During the 1950s, the Lutheran Church created a club for performing arts, where they enacted plays that were mostly centered around nativity.  \\n\nDuring the 1920s, Leonor Martínez of Centro Espiritista Caridad bajo Gloria organized several dramatic works to gather funds for the spiritist organization.  \\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years. The current mayor of Dorado is Carlos López Rivera , of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD).

A first stripe of gold is followed by a stripe of brown which is followed by a final stripe of gold. The gold or golden stripes symbolize the town\\'s name, Dorado; and the brown stripe represents the patron Saint of Dorado, Saint Anthony of Padua . A brown, equal-sided triangle is placed with its base at the hoist and leads to the second stripe, inside of which are the disks in the shape of a T and with the lily flowers represented with the Fleur-de-lis .  \\n\nThe Dorado coat of arms was officially adopted on March 27, 1978.

        "page_content": "Contents\nFlorida, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nFlorida  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the karst region north of Ciales , south of Barceloneta , east of Arecibo , and west of Manatí . Florida is not like other municipalities of Puerto Rico with multiple subdivisions called barrios. It has one barrio called Florida Adentro and two other subdivisions: Florida Zona Urbana and Pajonal comunidad . It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nFlorida was founded first as a barrio of Barceloneta in 1881 when a priest named Father Carrión, the mayor of Barceloneta, and other dignitaries visited a tract of land of almost 4 acres. They decided to establish a new barrio. The owner of the land, Don Manuel Cintrón, granted the land while he retained a piece of it. The barrio was first called Florida Adentro .  \\n\nDuring the 20th century, several efforts were made to declare Florida as a municipality . First, on April 14, 1949, House Representative Francisco Díaz Marchand presented a project to create a legislative commission that would study the economic and social conditions of the barrio, to determine the suitability of it as an independent municipality. The project was unsuccessful. In 1960, Manuel Frías Morales presented a law that would permit the study to establish the municipality but it was also unsuccessful.\\n\nFinally, on June 14, 1971, the Senate of Puerto Rico and Governor Don Luis A. Ferré approved the law that officially created the municipality of Florida. It is thus the youngest municipality established in the island.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Florida, 1400 homes were a total loss and 2,295 homes were partially damaged.  \\n\nGeography\nFlorida is the second smallest municipality of Puerto Rico, with an area of 10 square miles. As the only municipality in Puerto Rico that has its urban area within the northern karst region (sometimes referred as the Northern Karst Hills ), it is surrounded by low elevation, red clay and limestone haystack hills known in Caribbean Spanish as mogotes . The southern border of the municipality with Ciales remains one of the least developed areas on the island, due to the ruggedness of the karst. The Río Encantado , a subterranean river, drains this area.  Several caves are found in the town, including Román Cave, Miró Cave, and Juana Gómez Cave.  Balcon Cave ( Cueva Balcón ) is located in Florida.  \\n\nAs with all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Florida is subdivided into administrative units called barrios (which means barrios or boroughs or neighborhoods in English). A newer municipality of Puerto Rico, Florida has one barrio called Florida Adentro and two sub-barrios: Florida Zona Urbana and Pajonal. It does not have a \"barrio-pueblo\" like most of the other municipalities of Puerto Rico.    \\n\nThe following areas are neighborhoods in Florida:\\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.      For all\\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Florida: Sector El Hoyo in Comunidad San Agustín, Comunidad Arroyo, Sector Polvorín in Comunidad La Ceiba, Comunidad La Fuente, Estancias de Arroyo in La Joya, Sector El Cerro in Pajonal, and Sectors La Charca and Los Quemaos (both) in Parcelas Selgas.  \\n\nCulture and tourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Florida page lists Parque Ecológico Janet González , Río Encantado , and Bandera de Puerto Rico of the project Una Bandera, 78 Pueblos (One Flag, 78 Pueblos), as places of interest.  \\n\nFlorida celebrates its patron saint festival in September. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Florida include:\\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Florida\\'s economy relied heavily on agriculture, specifically pineapple crops and other fruit-related products. In recent decades, along with the rest of the Island, rapid urbanization and industrialization, along with economic challenges, have forced Florida\\'s fruit industry to near extinction.  Pharmaceutical manufacturing plants have been established in Florida.   \\n\nDemographics\nFlorida is one of the least populated municipalities of Puerto Rico, perhaps due to its small size. The population, according to the 2000 census, was 12,237 with a population density of 1,236.7 people per square mile (475.6/km 2 ). After its establishment in 1974, the population has steadily increased over the years, with 7,232 people in the 1980 census.\\n\nStatistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 86.0% of Florideños are of White origin, 4.9% are black , 0.2% are Amerindian etc.\\n\nGovernment\nAfter its initial establishment, Florida belonged to the Barceloneta region.  In 1949 and 1960 there were some attempts to separate the barrio from Barceloneta, but these were unsuccessful. However, in 1974, Governor Luis A. Ferré and the Puerto Rican Senate officially declared Florida an independent municipality. Its first mayor was Jorge L. Pérez Piñeiro. The current mayor is José Gerena Polanco , of the New Progressive Party (PNP). He was elected in the 2012 general elections .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district III , which is represented by two Senators. In 2008, José Emilio González and Angel Martínez were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nIt consists of three horizontal stripes, with the following colors and widths: green the superior and white the inferior, with five modules of width each one, the center one red, with a width of one module.  \\n\nField of silver, in an abyss, a gules (red) anchored cross, like the one in the Asturian district of Llanes . The cross is anchored between two branches of bloomed poinsettias ( Poinsettia pulcherrima ). A green terrace represents the hilly terrain of the town, with a stripe forming waves outlined in silver which represents the underground river of Encantado. At the top, a three tower gold crown distinct in municipalities coat of arms. The shield can be surrounded, to its flanks and bottom by two crossed coffee tree branches with fruits.  \\n\nFlorida derives its name from the abundant flowers and natural resources on its land.

        "page_content": "Contents\nGuayama, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nGuayama , officially the Autonomous Municipality of Guayama , is a city and municipality on the Caribbean coast of Puerto Rico . As of the 2020 U.S. Census , the city had a population of 36,614. It is the center of the Guayama metropolitan area with a population of 68,442 in 2020.\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe original name of the city is San Antonio de Padua de Guayama , named after the saint Anthony of Padua ; as with other settlement names in Puerto Rico, the name was eventually shortened to Guayama . Guayama comes from the name of a Taíno cacique (chief), who was leader of the tribes in the southeastern coast of Puerto Rico. The Taíno word Guayama ( wayama ) is said to mean \"great place\" or \"big open space\".  Another legend tells that the name of the town comes from the name of a woman called Juana Guayama who is said to have been an early owner of the land around Guayama and granter of the land in modern-day Machete where the town was later founded.  \\n\nThe first nickname of the city was Ciudad del Guamaní (\"city of the Guamaní [River]\") after the river that crosses the municipality. The name of this river might be related to the name Guayama , and it has been important to the city since its early founding.  A more modern and more popular nickname for the city is Pueblo de los brujos (\"town of witches\" or \"town of warlocks\") or Pueblo brujo (\"witch town\"). This nickname traces its origins to a popular story that tells that residents of the city would bring a kind of leaf called hoja bruja (\"witch leaf\") to baseball games to \"scare\" the opposing team by pretending to cast spells on them. The town\\'s baseball team then adopted the hoja bruja as their symbol.  Another story tells that the nickname comes from a legendary baseball player from the city\\'s local team, Moncho El Brujo, who according to legend owed his success as a pitcher to witchcraft.  Regardless of the origin of the nickname, residents of Guayama are often called brujos and their basketball team now carries the name Brujos de Guayama (\"Guayama Warlocks\").  \\n\nHistory\nDuring the early years of the Spanish colonization , the region known today as Guayama was inhabited by Taíno native people. The indigenous population in this area decreased due to slavery and migration to the Lesser Antilles. The following centuries, the region was under attack from the Taíno rebellion , Caribs and pirates . The town was founded on January 29, 1736, as San Antonio de Padua de Guayama by then Spanish Governor Matías de Abadía , although there is knowledge of it being populated by native people as early as 1567. It was Governor Don Tomás de Abadía who officially declared Guayama a \"pueblo\" (town) with the name of San Antonio de Padua de Guayama . That same year the Catholic church in town, San Antonio de Padua , was declared a Parish. In 1776, Guayama had 200 houses, the church and a central plaza and the total population was approximately 5,000 villagers. Construction on Guayama\\'s Parroquial church of San Antonio de Padua began in 1827 and was completed 40 years later. In 1828 the construction of the King\\'s House (Casa del Rey) was completed and the church was rebuilt as well. Earlier that year, Guayama was hit by a terrible fire that destroyed 57 houses and 9 huts. Guayama territorial order was altered at different times through the years. Some of the most populated neighborhoods were segregated to form new towns. Patillas was established in 1811 as an independent municipality. In 1831, the territory comprised the neighborhoods: Algarrobos , Ancones , Arroyo , Carreras , Guayama Pueblo , Guamaní , Jobos , Machete , and Yaurel . Later, Arroyo was divided into Arroyo Este and Arroyo Oeste and neighborhoods emerged: Pozo Hondo, Palmas de Aguamanil, Caimital, Pitajayas, Cuatro Calles, Sabana Eneas, Palmas, and Salinas . The latter had been segregated from Coamo .\\n\nIn 1855, Arroyo was separated to become an independent municipality, taking the neighborhoods: Ancones, Arroyo, Yaurel, Pitajaya, and Cuatro Calles. By 1878, Guayama was a department head including: Comerío (then Sabana del Palmar), Cidra , Cayey , Salinas, Arroyo, San Lorenzo (then called Hato Grande), Aguas Buenas , Caguas , Gurabo , and Juncos . The development continued with the construction of the town cemetery in 1844, the slaughterhouse and meat market in 1851, and a wooden theater of two levels in 1878. By then Guayama had fourteen sugar plantations operating with steam engines and three with ox mills. Also practiced in this municipality was the exploitation of lead mines by the company \"La Estrella\", owned by Miguel Planellas, as well as the mineral galena, by the company \"La Rosita\", owned by Antonio Aponte. In 1881, Guayama is declared a Villa (First Order Municipality).\\n\nDuring the Spanish-American War , American forces under General Nelson A. Miles landed at Guánica near Ponce on July 25, 1898. The landing surprised the United States War Department no less than the Spanish, as Miles had been instructed to land near San Juan (the War Department learned of the landing through an Associated Press release.) However, en route to Puerto Rico Miles concluded that a San Juan landing was vulnerable to attack by small boats, and so changed plans. Ponce, said at the time to be the largest city in Puerto Rico, was connected with San Juan by a 110-kilometre (70 mi)  military road, well defended by the Spanish at Coamo and Aibonito. In order to flank this position, American Major General John R. Brooke landed at Arroyo, just east of Guayama, intending to move on Cayey , which is northwest of Guayama, along the road from Ponce to San Juan. General Brooke occupied Guayama August 5, 1898, after slight opposition, in the Battle of Guayama . On August 9, the Battle of Guamaní took place north of Guayama. A more significant battle, the Battle of Aibonito Pass , was halted on the morning of August 13 upon notification of the armistice between the United States and Spain.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Guayama was 12,749.  \\n\nAfter the Spanish-American War, Guayama continued to develop. The Bernardini Theater built by engineer Manuel Texidor y Alcalá del Olmo opened in 1913. The venue, property of attorney Thomas Bernardini, was the scene for artists of international fame. By that time, Guayama was considered one of the most important cities on the island\\'s social scene.\\n\nIn the early twentieth century, there were selected societies such as the \\'Coliseo Derkes\\' and \\'Grupo Primavera\\', which endowed performing arts as well as scientific events. By the mid-twentieth century, Guayama achieved great industrial development, especially with the establishment of Univis Optical Corp., Angela Manufacturing Company and a petrochemical complex of the Phillips Petroleum Company . In 1968, the company started production of paraffin, benzene, synthetic fibers, nylon, plastic anhydrous, a 3,800,000 litres (830,000 imp gal; 1,000,000 US gal) of gasoline a day, and many other products. During that same decade agriculture began to decline as a result of land loss , industrialization and the construction of multiple housing developments. The urban growth affected the sugar cane industry . However, in 1974, 155,595 tons of sugar cane was harvested in the Municipality producing 12,655 tons of refined sugar.  \\n\nIn November 2002, AES Puerto Rico opened its coal power plant in Guayama. The company transmits and distributes electricity through a 25-year contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority . The 2012 National Puerto Rican Day Parade was dedicated to the Municipality of Guayama and its people.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In Guayama, the hurricane triggered numerous landslides and caused major destruction with an estimated 2000 homes losing their roof. The river caused major flooding and people were left with no power.    After Hurricane Maria, the people of Guayama resorted to collecting spring water for their drinking water.  \\n\nGeography\nGuayama is located at 17°58\\xe2\\x80\\xb227\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°06\\xe2\\x80\\xb236\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 17.974241°N 66.110034°W ﻿ / 17.974241; -66.110034 .   \\n\nThe Municipality of Guayama is located on the Southern Coastal Valley region, bordering the Caribbean Sea , south of Cayey ; east of Salinas ; and west of Patillas and Arroyo .

The studios of WAPA-TV is located in Guaynabo.\\n\nHistory\nThe first European settlement in Puerto Rico, Caparra , was founded in 1508 by Juan Ponce de León in land that is today part of Guaynabo. Ponce de León resided there as first Spanish governor of Puerto Rico. This settlement was abandoned in 1521 in favor of San Juan . The ruins of Caparra remain and are a U.S. National Historic Landmark . The Museum of the Conquest and Colonization of Puerto Rico, which features artifacts from the site and others in Puerto Rico, is located on the grounds.\\n\nThe municipality of Guaynabo was founded in 1769 by Pedro R. Davila (P.R.), after a struggle for division from the municipality of Bayamón . Previously, the municipality was known as Buinabo , a name that it is popularly said to mean in Taíno \" Here is another place of fresh water. \" Irish officer Thomas O\\'Daly and fellow Irishman Miguel Kirwan settled the area in the late 18th century and developed a farm and sugarcane plantation he named Hacienda San Patricio . The plantation no longer exists but the land on which it was located is now the central business district of Guaynabo and the San Patricio Plaza shopping mall.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In Guaynabo, where 26.9% of the population live below the poverty level, 2800 homes were destroyed.  The hurricane triggered numerous landslides in Guaynabo.   Then president Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump visited Guaynabo.  Due to the municipality\\'s fiscal difficulties, it was not until April 2, 2019, over a year and half later, that the overtime pay owed to municipal workers was paid.  \\n\nAfter 24 years as mayor, Héctor O\\'Neill García resigned in 2017 when allegations surfaced of sexual harassment toward a female municipal employee.  He was replaced in a run-off election by Angel Pérez Otero , who in turn was forced out due to his arrest for Federal corruption allegations in 2021.  Héctor O\\'Neill\\'s son Edward O\\'Neill Rosa won the following run-off election to succeed him as mayor in January 2022.  \\n\nGeography\nGuaynabo is on the northern side.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Guaynabo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a smaller barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , located near the center of the municipality.     \\n\n\\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion .

It is located in the central eastern region, north of San Lorenzo ; south of Trujillo Alto ; east of Caguas ; and west of Carolina and Juncos . Gurabo is spread over 9 barrios and Gurabo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nGurabo\\'s history dates as far back as the 17th century, when it was actually part of Caguas . Then, the area was known as Burabo . By 1700, transportation, medical and economic troubles were crippling the population of the Burabo area; traveling to Caguas\\' center for business and medical help was not easy and took hours. This led many of Burabo\\' s citizens to seek autonomy for the area.\\n\nIt would be long, however, before Gurabo was separated from Caguas. The separation movement was brought forward by an 1812 meeting of all 168 family leaders in Gurabo, who decided to have Luis del Carmen Echevarría lead them in their quest for independence, based on the large number of residents in Burabo .\\n\nIn 1815, Gurabo became a municipality. In 1822, the first Catholic church in town was erected. In 1903, the first Baptist church opened its doors in Gurabo town.\\n\nGurabo is also known as \" La Ciudad de las Escaleras \", or the \"City of Stairs\". Located in the town center district of El Cerro , the stairs ( step streets ) are about twenty-two floors high, and they are painted in bright colors.  \\n\nGurabo\\'s mayor is Rosachely Rivera Santana .  \\n\nThe significant amount of rainfall from Hurricane Maria triggered numerous landslides in Gurabo on September 20, 2017.

        "page_content": "Contents\nGuánica, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nGuánica  is a town and municipality in southern Puerto Rico , bordering the Caribbean Sea, south of Sabana Grande , east of Lajas , and west of Yauco . It is part of the Yauco metropolitan statistical area .\\n\nGuánica barrio-pueblo , also known as Pueblo de Guánica , is the downtown of the municipality. Guánica\\'s population in 2020 was 13,787 people. Guánica is located on a deeply indented harbor of the same name. The harbor resembles a tropical fjord , narrow and bordered by rugged hills, barely a quarter-mile wide, but about two miles (3.2 km) from mouth to the town. The town is about 100 miles (160 km) and over two hours\\' driving distance from San Juan , and about 20 miles (30 km) west of Ponce .\\n\nGuánica\\'s postal ZIP Code is 00653 and telephone area codes are 787 and 939. The urban settlement of Ensenada has a separate postal ZIP Code of 00647.\\n\nHistory\nJuan Ponce de León landed in the Guánica harbor on August 12, 1508, and founded a town called Guaynía , a word derived from the Taíno language that is popularly said to mean \" Here is a place with water \". The town, considered the first capital of the island of Puerto Rico (which was at that time named Isla de San Juan Bautista ), was destroyed during the indigenous uprising of 1511, and the area was abandoned by Europeans for some years, during which time San Juan (itself at first called Puerto Rico) became the capital of the island.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Guánica was 2,700.  The re-founded town of Guánica was at first a barrio of the municipality of Yauco until Guánica was established as a separate municipality on March 13, 1914. Víctor \\xc3\\x81ngel Sallaberry Safini was Guánica\\'s first mayor.\\n\n\\nOn July 25, 1898, American forces (who included the young poet-writer Carl Sandburg led by General Nelson A. Miles ) landed in Guánica as part of the course of the Puerto Rico campaign in the Spanish-American War . This invasion led to Puerto Rico being acquired by the United States. The invasion, just one small part of the war between Spain and United States, occurred in Guánica due to its sheltered harbor and proximity to Ponce , besides being such an unexpected site for such an attack, which had been anticipated at the heavily fortified city of San Juan . The Gloucester was the first ship to set anchor in the Bay of Guánica . Twenty-eight sailors and Marines , under the command of lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, departed from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the Spanish flag from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the American flag . They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed barbed wire around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. Méndez López and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. Méndez López and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco .   The invasion is commemorated by a contentious monument on the waterfront: along a broad paseo ( el malecón ), there is a large coral boulder known as the Guánica Rock ( Piedra de Guánica ) marked by the carved words, \"3rd Battalion, 1st U.S.V. Engineers, September 16, 1898.\" July 25 was subsequently commemorated in Puerto Rico as Occupation Day, later renamed Constitution Day (see Public holidays in Puerto Rico ).\nGuánica is a modern town that maintains roots and connections to a traditional past. Known as el pueblo de la amistad (\\'the town of friendship\\'), it is also occasionally referred to as el pueblo de las doce calles (\\'the town of the twelve streets\\'). The central part of town consists of five streets running north-south crossing seven other streets that run east-west, resulting in a compact grid of 24 square blocks, one of which is the main town square. Facing the square are the Catholic church, city hall, a school, and many shops; the plaza itself contains greenery, walks, and a music stand. In recent years this central area of the twelve streets has been extensively supplemented by suburbs in the south and west. Hills surround the town and harbor, including the 450-foot (140 m) hill to the east of town, itself topped by the tiny Fort Caprón . Two large factories, one producing fertilizer, partially distract the eye from the pleasant landscape, but both have been important to the economy of the town, at one time dominated by the sugar plantations of Central Guánica . The resort chain known as Club Med once attempted to set up a luxury resort on beaches east of the town but withdrew due to local opposition which was apprehensive about both environmental and community degradation. East of the town some 200 acres (80.9 ha) of land, including three miles (4.8 km) of beach, have been intermittently for sale. It is a fishing village; commercial fishermen still ply their traditional trade beyond the harbor entrance. Copamarina Beach Resort & Spa offers beach access and a short boat ride to Gilligan Island , the westernmost key of the Cayos de Caña Gorda , which is a great spot to go snorkeling . The water is crystal clear and shallow, in which old pieces of coral and fish can be seen. People can walk or swim from one island to another.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico.  In Guánica, 951 homes were damaged or destroyed.  \\n\nOn January 6, 2020, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake was felt in Guánica and nearby municipalities, and several residences and cars were destroyed.  On January 7, 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit.  \\n\nGeography\nGuánica has mountains and a dry forest. The Guánica State Forest ( Bosque Estatal de Guánica ) is also the name of a dry forest reserve east and west of the town, the largest remaining tract of tropical dry coastal forest in the world and designated an international Biosphere Reserve in 1981. The park comprising much of the dry forest is known as Bosque Seco de Guánica .   \\n\nHighway Route 116 , the nearest principal road, heads west toward Lajas and east toward Ponce , passing through the island of Puerto Rico\\'s driest area. The largely intact forest of the Guánica Dry Forest reserve hosts the greatest number of bird species found on the island, including several bird species seldom found anywhere else: the Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo , Puerto Rican woodpecker , the Puerto Rican nightjar , and the Puerto Rican emerald hummingbird. Other animals thought to be extinct in Puerto Rico have turned up in this forest. Many different types of cacti grow here, a stunning contrast to the lush Caribbean National Forest in the northeast part of the island, which is a tropical rainforest . The contrast is due to the mountain ridge Cordillera Central which separates Guánica from the northeast part of the island; while the northeast receives over 100 inches (2,500 mm) of precipitation each year, Guánica receives less than 30, and some regions of the forest reserve are said to receive only six inches.\\n\nThe forest reserve of some 9,500 acres (38 km 2 ) contains 36 miles (58 km) of trails through four different forest types: deciduous trees, a coastal region with tree-size milkweed and nine-foot-tall (2.7 m) prickly pear cactus , a mahogany forest, and twisted gumbo limbo trees . There are about 700 varieties of plants, including aroma ( acacia ) and guayacan ( Lignum vitae \\xe2\\x80\\x94Latin for \\'wood of life\\'). One guayacan is about 500-700 years old. The squat melon cactus and other cacti can be found here along with 40 species of birds, including the guabairo ( Puerto Rican nightjar ), found nowhere else. Also found in the area are the Puerto Rico crested toad ( Peltophryne lemur ) and, sometimes on the beaches, green and leatherback turtles , though their eggs suffer severe predation from mongooses one time introduced to fight rats in sugarcane fields.\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Guánica is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Guánica: Esperanza neighborhood, Callejón Magüeyes, El Batey, El Tumbao, Ensenada, Fuig, La Luna, and Playa Santa.  \\n\nTourism\n\\n\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Guánica page lists Bosque Seco de Guánica , Playa La Jungla , and Cayo Aurora \"Gilligan\\'s\" , as places of interest.  \\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , Guánica has 39 beaches, including Playa Santa .  \\n\nEconomy\nCulture\nGuánica celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Santiago Apostol is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as Cano Estremera , Tito Rojas , and Arcángel .  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Guánica include:\\n\nDemographics\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Guánica is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Ismael (Titi) Rodríguez Ramos , from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) . Rodríguez was elected in the 2020 general election after a close race with Santos Seda (Papichy) from the New Progressive Party (PNP) . While both candidates received almost the same share of the vote, 2,000 ballots where write in votes mostly for Edgardo Cruz Vélez an independent candidate.  This resulted in a vote recount and while the initial results signaled Vélez was the victor, after weeks of counting, Rodríguez was declared the winner.   Vélez initially conceded the race but then petitioned a court to adjudge early voting ballots to his count. This court case and subsequent court appeal where both dismissed.   \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two senators. In 2012 , Ramón Ruiz and Martín Vargas Morales , from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) , were elected as District Senators.  In 2020 , Marially Gozález and Ramón Ruiz , from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) , were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe five waves, blue and yellow represent the Guánica Bay, a fragment of the Official Shield of Guánica.  \\n\nShield divided in four quarters. In the superior right side, it has a \"bohío\" (a native hut) under a crown that represents Cacique Agüeybaná , whose yucayeque (Indian territory) was in this region. In the superior left quarter, a lion representing Juan Ponce de León . The red and yellow checkered strips over a silver-plated background in the inferior right side represent the shields of Don Cristóbal de Sotomayor , founder of the town of Tavara , the actual location of Guánica. The waved stripes represent the bay of this town. The branches surrounding the shield represent the sugarcane industry that was very important in this region.  \\n\nNotable \"Guaniqueños\"\nTransportation\nAt one time during 1937, Guánica received domestic, commercial airline flights from San Juan on Puerto Rico\\'s national airline, Puertorriqueña de Aviación .  \\n\nThere are 25 bridges in Guánica.  \\n\nGallery\nBooks\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nHatillo, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nHatillo  is a town and municipality located in Puerto Rico \\'s north coast, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Lares and Utuado to the south, Camuy to the west, and Arecibo to the east. According to the 2000 US Census Hatillo is spread over nine barrios and Hatillo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nAgustín Ruiz Miranda, a Canarian immigrant, founded Hatillo on approximately ten cuerdas (a cuerda is 0.97 acre, also called a Spanish acre) in 1823. Miranda granted this land on the condition that public buildings be erected and wide streets be built, and that the remaining land be sold or used for homes.  \\n\nIn its first year, Hatillo had 910 people; increasing to 2,663 inhabitants the following year distributed among the central town and the barrios of Carrizales , Capáez , Naranjito , Corcovado , Buena Vista (formerly Yeguada Occidental), Campo Alegre (formerly Yeguada Oriental), Pajuil, Bayaney , Aibonito , and the Pueblo . Barrio Pajuil had disappeared by the 1940 census being divided up between Buena Vista, Naranjito, Corcovado and Campo Alegre barrios. There were also two sugarcane plantations named \"Hacienda Santa Rosa\" measuring 150 cuerdas and \"Hacienda Perseverancia\" at 50 cuerdas .\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States .  In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Hatillo was 1,148.  \\n\nHatillo, like several other municipalities on the island, experienced boundary changes from the 1902 municipality consolidation law (Consolidación de Ciertos Términos Municipales de Puerto Rico) in which Hatillo was annexed temporarily into neighboring Camuy . Three years later the territorial legislature approved the reformation of Hatillo as a separate municipality (independent town) from Camuy in 1905.  In 1910, Barrio Pueblo (rural) changed its name to Hatillo barrio (rural). In 1930, Yeguadilla Occidental and Yeguadilla Oriental barrios\\' names were changed to Buena Vista and Campo Alegre, respectively. As mentioned before, Pajuil barrio disappeared by the 1940 census being divided up between barrios Buena Vista, Naranjito, Corcovado and Campo Alegre. In 1947 the Planning Commission of Puerto Rico issued a new map of Hatillo municipality and its barrios. As a result of this new map, the central town was expanded to include part of Hatillo barrio (rural) and the name of \"Corcovados\" was changed to \"Corcovado\".\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In Hatillo,  residences and municipal buildings sustained damage. The 75 dairy farms which produce much of the milk consumed in Puerto Rico were greatly affected. Ranchers said milk production would decrease by up to 45% in 2017.  The hurricane triggered numerous landslides in Hatillo.   \\n\nGeography\nHatillo is a coastal town on the northern side of Puerto Rico, on the Northern Karst region.  There are 9 bridges in Hatillo.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Hatillo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Hatillo: Altos de Fuego, Clan neighborhood, Aibonito, Naranjito, Bayaney, and Buena Vista.   \\n\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Hatillo page lists El Gran Parque del Norte , Hatillo Novalac , and Quesos Vaca Negra , as places of interest.  \\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , there are 10 beaches in Hatillo.  \\nOther places of interest in Hatillo include:  \\n\nEconomy\nToday, Hatillo is the major producer of milk on the island and produces a third of the milk consumed in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nPlaza del Norte is a shopping mall located in the barrio of Carrizales .\\n\nDemographics\nCulture\nHatillo celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Señora del Carmen is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as Sonora Ponceña , Andy Montañez , Pedro Capó , Sie7e and El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico .  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Hatillo include:\\n\nThe Mask Festival began in 1823, and was imported by the immigrants from the Canary Islands , where the traditional festival originated. The early tradition of the festival required that the male population dress as women and they would visit each residence where the owners would offer them food and drinks. Currently the festival is celebrated every year on December 28. The Masks are fashioned and based on the biblical story of King Herod ( Herod the Great ). The costumes used are very elaborate and the Masks represent the soldiers which were sent by the King Herod to kill all boys age three and younger, after hearing about a new king being born as told by the Three Wise Men . The festival, however is presented in humor and said soldiers only joke around and ride on chariots.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag consists of three broad stripes - Blue, Yellow and Green. Blue represents the sea, yellow represents the material and artistic wealth of the town, and green represents the vegetation of its fields in all its territorial extension.   \\n\nOn top of the shield is a gold crown with three towers over a silver field a Custard apple tree ( Annona reticulata ) and a field with two cows in gold which is over eight blue and silver-plated waves.

        "page_content": "Contents\nHormigueros, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nHormigueros  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the western region of the island, northeast of Cabo Rojo ; northwest of San Germán ; and south of Mayagüez . Hormigueros is spread over 5 barrios and Hormigueros Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center). It is part of the Mayagüez Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nThe region of what is now Hormigueros belonged to the Guaynia region, located on the southwest portion of Puerto Rico. Archaeological findings have established that there were tribes already settled in the region around 820 BC.\\n\nDuring the Spanish colonization at the beginning of the 16th century, European colonizers settled in the area. A coffin found underground the basilica was tested in laboratories and was dated prior to 1600. Historians also mention the Horomico River as one of the main sources of gold during the rush of the era.  In 1692, the settlement that would become the town of Hormigueros was first established as a village of San Germán . It was founded by Giraldo González de la Renta (sometimes spelled Geraldo).  \\n\nAfter its initial establishment, Hormigueros belonged to the municipality of San Germán .  From 1863 to 1873, residents of Hormigueros made formal petitions to be separated from San Germán and be declared an independent municipality. They were finally granted their independence as a municipality on April 1, 1874, being its first mayor Narciso Oller Serra.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Hormigueros was 3,215.  \\n\nAfter the American invasion of 1898 , Hormigueros was annexed this time to the town of Mayagüez . The annexation was ordered by Guy V. Henry , but according to Adolfo de Hostos, it was a town\\'s petition.  In 1912, they were granted their independence once again, although there were attempts to annex them again during 1928-29.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In minute Hormigueros, 651  residences were affected.  The hurricane triggered landslides in Hormigueros with its wind and rainfall.   \\n\nThere is folklore about the town\\'s founder, an explanation of why the church in the town, Basílica Menor de la Virgen de Monserrate , became so important. The legend has to do with the townspeople aiding Geraldo in finding his eight-year-old daughter, \"with eyes as blue as the turquoise skies\", when she disappeared. When his daughter was found 15 days later she was unharmed, not hungry, and unafraid and happily explained that a black woman had helped her. Geraldo and the townspeople imagined it was the Virgin of Montserrat and Geraldo said that for having helped his daughter she would be venerated for all ages. Many people heard of the tale and began praying for miracles at the place. Many pilgrimages have been made to the church, even as early as in the 17th century.  It had not been the first time Geraldo had experienced a miracle at the location where the church would be built. The first miracle was when a savage bull was going to attack him but when he prayed the bull bent its knees, bowed its head to the ground, and didn\\'t attack.  \\nSome versions of the story of the bull that would kill Geraldo state the bull\\'s legs actually broke and thus was unable to charge at him.  Since then, many Catholics perform penitence by walking the steps to the church on their knees.  \\n\nGeography\nThe municipality of Hormigueros can be divided in three areas: the northern mountainous region that covers one fourth of the town, with hills of relative height; a semi-mountainous region that extends from east to west covering downtown Hormigueros; and the flat, valley region that extends to the south covering 5.6 square miles.  \\n\nThe climate conditions of Hormigueros are hot and humid. The average temperature is 72 to 79 °F (22 to 26 °C).\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Hormigueros is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nThese residential areas are located outside Hormigueros downtown:\\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Hormigueros: Sector El Hoyo in Jagüitas, Lavadero, Salsipuedes and San Romualdo.   \\n\nCulture\nHormigueros celebrates its patron saint festival in September. The Fiestas Patronales Virgen de la Monserrate is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Hormigueros include:\\n\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Hormigueros page lists Basílica Menor de La Virgen de Monserrate , Casa de los Pelegrinos , and restaurants in Hormigueros, as places of interest.  \\n\nDespite its small size, Hormigueros does have several attractions for visitors including:  \\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Hormigueros is still developing. In the 1980s and 90s Allergan, Inc. had a subsidiary established in town boosting the economic development of Hormigueros. However, after Allergan left no other private industry has opened operations in the municipality. On the other hand, Hormigueros does provide abundant land, talent and accessibility for an economic development and expansion. Not far away there are two regional airports: Eugenio María de Hostos Airport at Mayagüez and Mercedita Airport at Ponce . In addition, there is the Rafael Hernández International Airport at Aguadilla . All three airports lie within 30 miles approximately.  \\n\nDemographics\nHormigueros is one of the least populated municipalities. The population, according to the 2000 census, was 16,614 with a population density of 1,510.3 people per square mile (580.9/km 2 ). Since the 1950s, the population has more than doubled.\\n\nStatistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 86.0% of Hormiguereños self-identify as Spanish or white origin, 4.9% as black , 0.2% as indigenous or other.\\n\nGovernment\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district IV , which is represented by two senators. In 2012, Gilberto Rodríguez and María Teresa González were elected as district senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe town\\'s flag is based on the towns shield. It consists of a blue cloth with a horizontal white rhombus . Superposed on the white rhombus is another blue rhombus with a white globe outlined in blue with a cross. The globe with the cross symbolises royalty and represents Christ\\'s domain over the world. This symbol is a traditional attribute to the Virgin of Montserrat.   \\n\nThe town\\'s shield is formed by a blue rhombus, with silver-plated edge. On the blue bottom there\\'s a green hill which is a representation of Our Lady of Monserrate de Hormigueros Sanctuary, with its silver stairway. The border has symmetrical black dots, on guard. On the top of the shield resides a crown formed by a wall, with three towers that have blue doors and windows. The joints of the stones are filled with blue lines. The shield is surrounded by two chains that begin at the crown and finish under the bottom part of the shield with the last links broken.   \\n\nThe name of Hormigueros means \" anthill \" in English. The town possibly derives its name from three concepts. The first one refers to the crowds that gathered at the Basilica Menor on September 8 to honor the Virgin of Montserrat . The second refers to the topographic formation of the town which consists of countless hills resembling \"anthills\" or mogotes , reason why it was called \"Valle del Hormiguero\" or \"Anthill Valley\". Third, it is possible that the name was originated from a Taíno word: Horomico, which means \"río de oro\" or \"river of gold\" due to the importance of the rivers in the area during the gold rush of the Spanish colonization .  \\n\nEducation\nHormigueros boasts several public and private schools within its territory. Public education is handled by the Puerto Rico Department of Education , specifically the Mayaguez Local Educational Agency (LEA).\\n\nThe local schools are:\\n\nElementary schools\\n\nMiddle schools\\n\nHigh schools\\n\nSecond unit (elementary and middle)\\n\nAt the same time, most of the population (21-35) has either a bachelor or a higher degree, [ citation needed ] making the town one of the most talented ones in the Island of Puerto Rico. [ citation needed ] \\n\nTransportation\nPuerto Rico Highway 2 provides access to Hormigueros from the nearby city of Mayagüez , or from Ponce . The rest of the roads in the town are mostly rural.\\n\nIt has a public transportation system consisting of public cars. Taxis are also available around the town.\\n\nThere are 16 bridges in Hormigueros.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nHumacao, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nHumacao  is a city and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the eastern coast of the island, north of Yabucoa ; south of Naguabo ; east of Las Piedras ; and west of Vieques Passage . Humacao is spread over 12 barrios and Humacao Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nThe region of what is now Humacao belonged to the Taíno region of Humaka, which covered a portion of the southeast coast of Puerto Rico.  The region was led by cacique Jumacao (also referred to as \"Macao\").  The Taíno settlement was located on the shores of what is called now the Humacao River . It is believed that the Taíno chief Jumacao was the first \"cacique\" to learn to read and write in Spanish, since he wrote a letter to the King of Spain Charles I complaining about how the Governor of the island wasn\\'t complying with their peace agreement. In the letter, Jumacao argued that their people were virtually prisoners of Spain. It is said that King Charles was so moved by the letter that he ordered the Governor to obey the terms of the treaty.   [ self-published source ] \\n\nDuring the early 16th century, the region was populated by cattle ranchers . However, since most of them officially resided in San Juan , a settlement was never officially organized. At the beginning of the 18th century, specifically around 1721-1722, the first official settlement was constituted in the area. Most of the residents at the time were immigrants from the Canary Islands , but due to attacks from Caribs , pirates , and other settlers, some of them moved farther into the island in what is now Las Piedras .  Still, some settlers remained and by 1776, historian Fray \\xc3\\x8dñigo Abbad y Lasierra visited the area and wrote about the population there. By 1793, the church was recognized as parish and the settlement was officially recognized as town.  \\n\nBy 1894, Humacao was recognized as a city. Due to its thriving population, buildings and structures like a hospital, a theater, and a prison were built in the city. In 1899, after the United States invasion of the island as a result of the Spanish-American War , the municipality of Las Piedras was annexed to Humacao. This lasted until 1914, when the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico voted on splitting both towns again.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Humacao was 14,313.  \\n\nHumacao was led by mayor Marcelo Trujillo Panisse for over a decade. A basketball star in his early years, Trujillo has pushed for the development of infrastructure facilities for sports and the fine arts in the city. In March 2008, a new Roman Catholic diocese was established as the Fajardo -Humacao diocese. Its first bishop is Monsignor Eusebio \\'Chebito\\' Ramos Morales , a maunabeño who was rector of the Humacao\\'s main parish in the 1990s.\\n\nIn 2019, Luis Raul Sanchez became interim mayor of Humacao after Marcelo Trujillo Panisse died in September 2019.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  Punta Santiago in Humacao saw a six-foot storm surge. The hurricane caused destruction of homes and infrastructure.  \\n\nGeography\nHumacao is located in the southeast coast of Puerto Rico . It is bordered by the municipalities of Naguabo to the north, Yabucoa to the south, and Las Piedras to the west. The Atlantic Ocean borders the city in the east. Humacao is located in the region of the Eastern Coastal Plains, with most of its territory being flat. There are minor elevations to the southwest, like Candelero Hill, and northwest, like Mabú. Humacao\\'s territory covers 45 square miles (117 km 2 ).  Two islands belong to Humacao: Cayo Santiago and Cayo Batata .  \\n\nHumacao\\'s hydrographic system consists of many rivers and creeks like Humacao , Antón Ruíz , and Candelero . Some of its creeks are Frontera, Mariana, and Del Obispo, among many others.  \\n\nIn 2019, updated flood zone maps show that Humacao is extremely vulnerable to flooding, along with Toa Baja , Rincón , Barceloneta , and Corozal . Located where most cyclones enter the island, Humacao is one of the most vulnerable areas of Puerto Rico.  Humacao was working on flood mitigation plans and shared that its barrios located on the coast; Antón Ruíz , Punta Santiago , Río Abajo , Buena Vista and Candelero Abajo barrios, are extremely vulnerable to flooding and destruction.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Humacao is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English).

The Humacao page lists Reserva Natural de Humacao , its Pueblo with historic architecture, and its cuisine, specifically Granito , as places and things of interest.  \\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , there are 8 beaches in Humacao including Punta Santiago .  Palmas del Mar Beach in Humacao is considered a dangerous beach due to its strong currents.  \\n\nDue to its location on the coast and relative short distance from the capital, Humacao is a frequent stop for tourists. One of the most notable tourist mainstays is the Palmas del Mar resort, which is Puerto Rico\\'s largest resort. This mega-resort is composed of over 3,000 acres (12 km 2 ) of land and occupies the entire southeastern portion of Humacao. The resort contains tennis courts, two world-class golf courses, beach access, several restaurants and a riding center.\\n\nAside from the beaches at the Palmas del Mar resort, Humacao has other beaches. The most popular ones are Punta Santiago , Buena Vista, Punta Candelero, and El Morrillo.  The Candelero Beach Resort, built in 1973, with its 107 rooms, 25 which are suites, was purchased and revitalized by the Suarez family.  \\n\nThe Astronomical Observatory at the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao ,  Casa Roig , the Guzmán Ermit, the Humacao Wildlife Refuge, and the Church Dulce Nombre de Jesús may be classed as other places of interest.\\n\nIn the 1980s, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources established the Humacao Nature Reserve (also called the Punta Santiago Nature Reserve) in the municipality.  The Palmas del Mar Tropical Forest is also located in Humacao.  \\n\nEconomy\nBurlington in Humacao employs under 100 people and reopened its doors in March 2019.

It is organized by the Mariana\\'s Recreational and Cultural Association (ARECMA), a community organization of the Mariana barrio. Its main theme is about the preparation of dishes whose main ingredient is breadfruit. Typical Puerto Rican music, crafts and foods as well as other cultural and sports activities can also be enjoyed. Most years it has been held at one of the highest elevations within the sector with views to Humacao, Las Piedras , Naguabo , Vieques and Yabucoa .\\n\nHumacao Grita is an urban art festival held in November.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Humacao include:  \\n\nThe Grises basketball team ( Humacao Grays ), founded in 2005, belongs to Puerto Rico\\'s National Superior Basketball league.

The gold represents the sun, Humacao is located in the island were the sun rises. Green symbolizes the native Indian heritage as well as the natural tropical valley where the city is located. The shield itself represents Humacao\\'s native and Indian name origin. The coat of arms was designed by Roberto Brascochea Lota in 1975 and approved by Humacao on November 13, 1975.  \\n\nTransportation\nHumacao\\'s airport is no longer used for daily flights to Vieques and Culebra as it was in the past. It is now used for private flights.\\n\nHumacao is served by two freeways and one tolled expressway, therefore is one of a few cities in Puerto Rico with good access. Puerto Rico Highway 30 , Autopista Cruz Ortiz Stella , serves as the main highway coming from the west ( Caguas , Las Piedras ), while Puerto Rico Highway 53 serves from the north ( Fajardo , Naguabo ) and south ( Yabucoa ). Puerto Rico Highway 60 , the Carretera Dionisio Casillas , is a short freeway located entirely in Humacao, and has exits serving downtown Humacao and Anton Ruiz .\\n\nPuerto Rico Highway 3 , the main highway bordering the east coastline of Puerto Rico from San Juan , passes through Humacao and has its only alt route in the town, known locally as the Bulevar del Rio (River Boulevard) where it has access to the main judiciary center of the city, as well as a future theatre that is being built, the Centro de Bellas Artes de Humacao (Humacao Fine Arts Center).

Although the actual date of the origins of the first Spanish settlement is not precisely known, a small settlement/hermitage is known to have existed by the end of the 17th century or beginning of the 18th century in a great extension of land into what encompass today the municipalities of Isabela, Camuy and Quebradillas . The settlement was bordered to the east with the shoreline of the Guajataca River and was located on the grounds of an earlier Taíno settlement.\\n\nAround 1725, José Antonio de Mendizábal y Azares, Governor of the Island of Puerto Rico granted authorization to base a population on the existing hermitage/village. Its given name, San Antonio de La Tuna , derives from the avocation of the Spanish settlers to the saint Anthony of Padua and in honor of a wild cactus growing in the region (Tuna is the Spanish term for cactus ). At the end of the 18th century San Antonio de la Tuna had a church, more than sixty houses, and almost 1,200 inhabitants, which was a considerable population for those times.\\n\nPrompted by economic and health factors, the decision to relocate the hermitage to a more favorable location was pursued. Around 1818, the village obtained authorization from then Governor Salvador Meléndez to transfer the population to a new location closer to the coast. Meléndez approved the transfer request and a new town was founded the following year on May 21, 1819. In the same year the construction of the church began, and was finished in 1824. In 1918 the church was damaged during a strong earthquake that affected the western region of the island, it was rebuilt soon after. [ citation needed ] \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Isabela was 14,888.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Isabela, the hurricane caused destruction of homes and infrastructure. Maria caused structural damage to the nearby Guajataca Reservoir and thousands of people were evacuated from their homes.  \\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2010 census, there were 45,631 people in the city. This represents an increase of more than 1,000 from the 2000 census.  The population density was 825.1 inhabitants per square mile (318.6/km 2 ). The 2020 census indicated the municipality had 42,943 residents, a decline of over 3,000.  \\n\nGeography\nIsabela is a hybrid town of sorts, with the rarity of being a coastline city that has beaches but is also known for its mountains (with peaks of over 1,000 ft [300 m] above sea level), rivers (surface and submarine), lakes, caves (surface and submarine), cliffs, coastal flats and forests (including mangroves ).  \\n\nGeographically, the municipality of Isabela belongs to the Northern Coastal Plains and the Northern Karst region. Running through the south, the Aymamón Mountains , a prolongation of the Jaicoa Mountain Range that begins in the neighboring town of Aguadilla , boasts peaks of over 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea level. The most prominent hills that are part of these mountains are La Bandera ( Galateo Alto ward) at 1,207 ft (368 m); La Silla ( Arenales Alto ward) at 1,106 ft (337 m); El Sombrero (in Galateo Alto ) at 1,083 feet (330 m); Indio ( Planas ward) at 1,017 feet (310 m); and Monte Encantado (in Arenales Altos) at 919 feet (280 m) of elevation above sea level. The central part of the territory consists mostly of flatlands, the mountains do not surpass 656 feet (200 m) in height and the coastline flats ( Bajuras ) are slightly above sea level.\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Isabela is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Isabela: Cerro del Sombrero in Arenales Alto, Pueblo Nuevo in Arenales Bajos, Barriada Corchado, Comunidad Poncito in Llanadas, Sector Las Parcelas and Sector Pastillo and Sector San Antonio de la Tuna in Coto, Sector Capiro and Sector Corea in Galateo Alto, Sector El Ramal in Guerrero, Parcelas Nuevas and Parcelas Viejas in Mora Guerrero, Comunidad Cristal, Sector Planas, Media Cuerda, Parcelas Jobos, Santa Bárbara, Sector El Cañón, Sector El Verdum, Sector La Mantilla, Sector La Marina, Sector La Mina, Sector La Sierra, Tocones, and Villa Pesquera.   \\n\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Isabela page lists Playa Montones , Tunel de Guajataca , and Mabodamaca , as places of interest.  \\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , there are 12 beaches in Isabela including Jobos .  \\nThe main attractions of Isabela include:\\n\nEconomy\nThe early economy of the hermitage had been based mainly on cattle [ranching], its derivative products and hogs products, but trading was limited due to many factors: its inland location and topography. The settlement was posted above a hill overlooking the river (now River Guajataca ) which made it difficult to use the river as a trading route, as did the location\\'s propensity to disease and outbreaks. [ citation needed ] \\n\nAfter the transfer to the present Isabela location the economic realities that resulted from the new land and property opportunities that were readily available, the healthier environment formed due to the wide open plains and prevalent northern winds, and the proximity to the coast and the natural sea port at the bay of Punta Sardina prompted for the diversification of the agricultural products and an increase in trade. The cultivation of sugarcane , coffee, tobacco, cotton, Cassava/yuca, coconut and other fruits was stimulated further. Isabela continued to flourish until recent years due to the island\\'s economic crisis, the closing of important factories and the rising crime rate.\\n\nIsabela also has a hi-tech plant, a higher education institution, a world-renowned agricultural research center and a major shopping center, Plaza Isabela.  \\n\nCulture\nIsabela celebrates its patron saint festival in June. The Fiestas Patronales de San Antonio de Padua is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Isabela include:\\n\nIsabela is also well known for its world-class surfing spots, and hosted two World Cup Surfing Championships , as well as some of the Rip Curl Pro competitions.  \\n\nIsabela had a basketball team that played at the Jose \"Buga\" Abreu Coliseum , the Isabela Roosters (\"Gallitos de Isabela\") Between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, the Bantams were serious championship contenders. In the late 1970s their star player, Mickey Coll, died in a motorcycle accident. The team\\'s first home court was named after him. The Bantams were Isabela\\'s home team until October 2005 when they moved the franchise to Guaynabo. \\n\nThe Playeras, a female volleyball team, played in Isabela for 2 seasons until they also moved to Aguadilla becoming Las Divas.\\n\nThe Isabela Muscle Cars Club, celebrating annual events since 2002, is a popular event in Isabela. [ citation needed ] On August 28, 2016, the club celebrated their 15th Anniversary at the Coliseum Jose \"Buga\" Abreu .\\n\nThe town also has its own classic car club, called \"Club de Autos Clasicos y Antiguos del Noroeste\" (Classic and Old Car Club from Northwest). They also celebrate their own Exhibition of Classic Cars at the coliseum in November.\\n\nThe local basketball team was called the \"Gallitos\" (\"Little Cocks,\" in reference to the slim, lightweight body of the fighting variety) due to the town\\'s fame for quality fighting cocks. The name was translated literally into English as \"Bantams\", a variety of dwarf cocks.\\n\nThe town has a cockfighting arena, traditionally called a gallera . Fights were customarily held on Sunday mornings, and the bets and stakes were controlled by the government of Puerto Rico. Prizes were paid based on the fighting record of the cocks. A law prohibiting cockfighting in the U.S. and its territories went into effect in early 2019.  \\n\nIsabela has amateur baseball teams. Also, Isabela is well known for its Fine Step Horses (\"Caballos de Paso Fino \") and its world class board, wind and kite surfing spots.\\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Isabela is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Miguel \"Ricky\" Méndez Pérez, from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD).  Méndez was elected in the 2020 general election .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district IV , which is represented by two senators. In 2012, María Teresa González and Gilberto Rodríguez were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nTransportation\nThere are 5 bridges in Isabela.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nIsabela\\'s flag derives its design, colors and symbolism from its coat of arms. It consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The top and bottom stripe are yellow and the center one green. The coat of arms may be superposed on the green stripe in the center.  \\n\nThe town\\'s coat of arms , dated 1819, is divided an olive tree in its center, symbolizes the first inhabitants of Isabela and of the island of Puerto Rico, the Igneris Indians. The gold represents the Taíno Indians (they made extensive use of gold), who lived in this area about two hundred years before the discovery of the island. The gold bell represented in the center stripe between two cactus is a symbol of the town of San Antonio de la Tuna . The two cocks represent the bravery of the inhabitants and Isabela\\'s famous fighting cocks . The horse represents the cattle wealth of the region and honors the fine step horses ( Paso Fino ) for which Isabela is known.  The coat of arms is embellished with a mural crown having three towers, the standard emblem at the time for formally established \\'pueblos\\' (townships) under Spanish rule. The revised mural crown with five towers represents a city, but historically, only 11 communities  in Puerto Rico were conferred this title when under Spanish rule.\\n\nOn the occasion of the celebration of 186 years of Isabela it was necessary to adopt an ordinance to establish properly the historical veracity and heraldic elements of the emblazoned shield and official seal of the City of Isabela. The following information was drafted pursuant to Ordinance Number 3, series 2005-2006 and approved by the Municipal Legislature on August 5, 2005:\\n\n\"The Mural Crown: Current mural crown that has the coat of Isabela has three towers. Due to population increase of over 50,000 inhabitants who had Isabela in this last decade, the HUD office in Washington DC, conferred status as a \"city\" to Isabela last year. Given this demographic reality and focused on the mural crown that represents the spirit of unity and growth of the inhabitants of our city of Isabela, we understand appropriate that the crown mural consists of \"five\" distinct towers that symbolize the passage from town to city.\"  \\n\nGallery\nNotable people\nSee also\nReferences\nBooks\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nJayuya, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nJayuya  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the mountainous center region of the island, north of Ponce ; east of Utuado ; and west of Ciales . Jayuya is spread over 10 barrios and Jayuya Pueblo   (the downtown and administrative center of the city). It is the principal city of the Jayuya Micropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nNamed after the Taíno tribal leader, Hayuya , Jayuya is known for its skilled wood carvers . Among its monuments are the statue of Nemesio Canales and the bust of Hayuya, both by the Puerto Rican sculptor Tomás Batista .\\n\nHistory\nThe town of Jayuya was founded in 1911, but history traces non-indigenous settlers living in the region as far back as 1878. At that time, a small community was established there, separated from the larger cities of the coasts with little to no communication. Near the end of the 19th century, the town focused on the production of coffee, which greatly boosted the local economy.\\n\nIn 1911, the town was officially declared a municipality with a population of more than 9,000.\\n\nIn 1950, the town was the setting of the Jayuya Uprising , in which Nationalists started a revolt against the Government of the United States led by Blanca Canales , a social worker, and her cousins, Elio and Doris Torresola. Canales led the group into the main town square and gave a speech, declaring Puerto Rico an independent republic . The police station was later attacked, telephone lines cut, and the post office burned to the ground. One police officer was killed and three others wounded in these attacks. The group held the town for three days, until it was bombed by U.S. planes supporting a ground attack by the Puerto Rico National Guard . Even though an extensive part of the town was destroyed, the news of the American bombing was not reported outside of Puerto Rico. Instead, it was reported by the American media stateside as an incident between Puerto Ricans.\\n\nWhen Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, the people of Jayuya had to resort to collecting spring water.  Immediately following the hurricane, rescue and restoration efforts began by community members who gathered at the local high school.  Most wooden structures were destroyed.  \\n\nGeography\nJayuya is located in the center of the island of Puerto Rico, in a valley in the middle of the Cordillera Central . Due to this location, its terrain is mostly rough and steep. Some of the highest mountains of the island are located in this region, including Monte Jayuya , Cerro Rosa , Tres Picachos and the highest mountain of the island, Cerro Punta , at 4,389 ft (1,338 m).  \\n\nThe town\\'s total area is estimated at 39.4 square miles (102.05 km 2 ) [ citation needed ] . Part of the Toro Negro State Forest is located within the municipality of Jayuya. Rivers like Río Naranjito and Río Yunes , as well as the Río Grande de Jayuya and its various affluents, flow through this municipality.\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Jayuya is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in the center of the municipality, in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Jayuya: Gripiñas, Puerto Plata, Saliente, Salientito, Las Arenas, Comunidad Mario Canals (Sector El Salto), Comunidad Márquez, Hoyo Frío, Sector El Nudo, Santa Clara, Sector San Felipe , and Sector Las Casitas in Vista Alegre .   \\n\nAs in most municipalities located in the mountain region, the climate is mostly cool with temperatures in the 80 to 70 °F (27 to 21 °C) range. However, they are known to go as low as 50 or 60 °F (10 or 16 °C) during some winters.\\n\nDemographics\nFestivals and events\nJayuya celebrates its patron saint festival in September. The Fiestas Patronales Nuestra Señora de la Monserrate is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as Victor Manuelle .  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Jayuya include:\\n\nTourism\nDue to its location, Jayuya is usually mentioned as the obligatory municipality to visit when visiting the center of the island of Puerto Rico .

Nearby, there\\'s a monument to Chief Hayuya , cacique of the region.\\n\n\\nIn the outskirts of the city, tourists can visit the Cerro de Punta , highest peak in the island of Puerto Rico, as well as the other mountains mentioned ( Tres Picachos , for example). The Toro Negro State Forest can also be reached through the city.\nJayuya is home to the first aerostat in Puerto Rico and one of the world\\'s largest. It is located in barrio Mameyes, at 3,200 feet above sea level. When the aerostat lifts, it reaches 3,500 feet where it has a panoramic view of 360 degrees.  \\n\nCoffee production can be seen at Hacienda San Pedro located in Jayuya.  \\n\nEconomy\nJayuya\\'s economy has always depended greatly on agriculture. Products like coffee, tomato, and other vegetables are produced and distributed in the region. Livestock is another part of the city\\'s economy.\\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, several manufacturing industries established in Jayuya, aiming to revitalize the economy as well as provide work for the residents. Some of the companies currently in the city are Baxter Healthcare and Abbott Laboratories . A bridge used by these companies for the delivery of their materials to their plants was destroyed by Hurricane Maria . Work was set to begin on the bridge in 2019.  \\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Jayuya is administered by a mayor.

It symbolizes the spirit of people proud of their Taíno heritage and their hospitality.  \\n\nJayuya\\'s coat of arms consists of a shield with a three tower crown above, which is standard for municipalities. Inside the shield, centered at the top, a crown representing Chief Hayuya \\'s monarchy. In the center a green band with a white border representing the Tres Picachos (Three Peaks) mountains. The green color symbolizes the countryside and the town\\'s matron, La Virgen de la Monserrate . At the bottom of the shield, is a petroglyph known as the Taíno Sun found in Jayuya.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

Juana Díaz is spread over 13 barrios and Juana Diaz Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the Ponce Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nJuana Díaz is known as \"La Ciudad del Maví\" (Maví City). Mabi is a fermented Taíno beverage made out from the bark of the mavi tree Colubrina elliptica .\\n\nHistory\nJuana Díaz was founded in 1798 and was known as Ciudad de Jacagua , in honor of the Taíno Cacique Jacaguax.  The civil government of this territory was established on April 25, 1798.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In August of 1898, Stephen Crane , a war correspondent for Hearst\\'s New York Journal , single-handedly took possession of the town before an American regiment arrived. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Juana Díaz was 27,896.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Juana Díaz, 2,500 homes lost their roof.  \\n\nGeography\nJuana Díaz is located on the southern coast. Several rivers run through the Juana Díaz territory, among them, Río Inabón and the Río Jacaguas , from which Juana Díaz takes it\\'s nickname, \"Ciudad del Jacaguas\". The Guayabal dam between Juana Díaz and Villalba is located in this river. Among its main tributaries are Río Toa Vaca in Villalba, also dammed. Both Guayabal and Toa Vaca lakes are visible in the map. Lake Toa Vaca is also the main source of drinking water for Juana Díaz, Ponce and other towns.  The highest point in the municipality is located close to the top of Cerro Maravilla .\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Juana Díaz is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  \\nand subbarrios,    are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English).

The Juana Díaz page lists Casa Museo de los Santos Reyes , Salto de Collores , and Casa de la historia Juanadina José Rafael Gilot , as places of interest.  \\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , there are 30 beaches in Juana Díaz.  \\n\nEconomy\nIn the past, Juana Díaz was a large producer of sugarcane but with industrial development the sugar cane industry disappeared. Local rums are now produced from raw materials imported from other countries. Juana Díaz produces plantains, bananas, mangoes, and other crops that are consumed in the local markets and also exported to other countries. Cattle and pigs are also raised in local farms.\\n\nJuana Díaz is a producer of beige marble , one of the finest marbles in the world.\\n\nCulture\nJuana Díaz celebrates its patron saint festival in late August / early September. The Fiestas Patronales de San Ramón Nonato is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Juana Díaz include:\\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Juana Díaz is administered by a mayor.

In 2012, Ramón Ruiz and Martín Vargas Morales , from the Popular Democratic Party , were elected as district senators.  The other part of the city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VI , which has been represented by Miguel Pereira Castillo and Angel M. Rodríguez since 2012.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag of Juana Díaz is rectangular in shape, formed by two triangles whose hypotenuse extends from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. The upper triangle is white, the symbol of silver and the lower triangle is yellow or gold. At its center is the coat of arms of Juana Díaz in its natural colors.   \\n\nThe coat of arms features The Nazarene Cross. It is in the center of the coat of arms. It stands out subtly between furrows and space, symbolizing the union of two races by means of the inalienable bond of the Christian faith. The cross also symbolizes the western Christian culture.  \\n\nThe woman represents - Mrs. Juana Díaz, the towns namesake - with her hands the woman strews thirteen grains of corn into thirteen furrows, symbolizing the seeds that germinated and were the base for the foundation and growth of our town. The woman dresses as those of her time.   \\n\nThe sun symbolizes a new horizon, hope in the formation of a town. The sun within the coat of arms has thirteen rays, each represents one of the barrios of Juana Díaz.   \\n\nThirteen knolls stand out in the coat of arms symbolizing each of the thirteen barrios or barrios of Juana Díaz. The mountains also symbolize that Juana Díaz has been one of the richest mineral towns in Puerto Rico.   \\n\nThe Indians represents the natives who settled the village before the arrival of the white man. The native carries on his back thirteen sheathed arrows and a bow, and an arrow on his head. The bow and arrow represent the only effective means of defense useful for survival.   \\n\nThe shackle and the whip represent Juana Díaz as the martyr of 1887 because the most heinous, repressive institution known at the time was enforced in our town, \"El Componte\". It was in Juana Díaz where liberal politicians and dedicated patriots were martyred because they fought against the tyranny imposed by Spanish General Romualdo Palacios . Palacios was the most tyrannical and cruel of all the governors of our nation. \"El Componte\", a military tribunal, was used to quiet the rebel voices of those who loved law and order.   \\n\nThe harp represents the music, the quill pen dipped in the ink well represents the verse, the poetry. Juana Díaz has generously given distinguished poets to Puerto Rican literature.   \\n\nCiudad del Jacaguas is the name by which Juana Díaz was known in the past. Many people knew Juana Díaz as the city of Jacaguas, but Luis Lloréns Torres dubbed it \"La Versalles de Ponce\" (Ponce\\'s Versailles).   \\n\nFour Castles Represent that Juana Díaz reached the stature of city. Cities have five castles in their coat of arms, villages have four and smaller towns have three.   \\n\nTransportation\nAmong the most important roads in Juana Díaz are the Luis A. Ferré Expressway ( PR-52 ) which connects Juana Díaz to Ponce and the airport in just minutes and San Juan in a little more than one hour. Other important roads include road PR-14 which runs through downtown Juana Díaz on its route between Ponce and Cayey , road PR-149 from Juana Díaz to Manatí running through Villalba and the \" Cordillera Central \" and road PR-1 which goes from Ponce to San Juan through the community of Pastillo in the south coast of Juana Díaz.\\n\nThere are 51 bridges in Juana Díaz.  \\n\nNotable people\nNatives of the Juana Diaz are referred to as \"Juanadinos\" within Puerto Rico.

Lares is located north of Maricao and Yauco ; south of Camuy , east of San Sebastián and Las Marias ; and west of Hatillo , Utuado and Adjuntas . Lares is spread over 10 barrios and Lares Pueblo (Downtown Lares). It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nA city adorned with Spanish -era colonial-style churches and small downtown stores, Lares is located on a mountainous, breezy area that is about 1.5 hours from the capital San Juan by car.\\n\nIn 1868, Lares was the site of the Grito de Lares (literally, The Cry of Lares , or Lares Revolt), an uprising brought on by pro-independence rebels members of the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico striving for Puerto Rican independence from Spain . Even though it was short-lived, it remains an iconic historical event in the history of the island . The flag of the revolt, known as the Bandera del Grito de Lares (Grito de Lares flag) , is the official flag of Lares.  \\n\nHistory\nLares was founded on April 26, 1827 by Francisco de Sotomayor and Pedro Vélez Borrero, who named the town after Amador de Lariz , a Spanish nobleman and one of its settlers.   \\n\nLares was the location of the Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares) revolt against Spanish rule in Puerto Rico on September 23, 1868. The revolt is recognized as the most important symbol of the Puerto Rican struggle for independence .  Historian Fernando Picó described it thus:\\n\nLares adopted the flag of the revolt as its official flag. The flag was proclaimed the national flag of a sovereign \"Republic of Puerto Rico\" by the revolting revolutionaries in 1868, making it the first flag of Puerto Rico. In 1895, the exiled revolutionaries replaced it with the current flag of Puerto Rico as the new revolutionary flag to represent an independent Puerto Rico. As the flag of the revolt, the flag of Lares is used by the independence movement in Puerto Rico to show support for the independence of the island from the United States .\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Lares was 20,883.  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Lares. In many areas of Lares there were more than 25 landslides per square mile due to the significant amount of rainfall.   Puerto Rico se levanta (Puerto Rico will stand up) became the slogan used across the island to communicate the island would rise again.  \\n\nWhen the hurricane hit, many areas in the Municipal Cemetery of Lares were damaged by landslides. Total affected were about 5,000 burial plots, with the burial places shifting and some plots opened. In response, the municipality closed the cemetery to the public.   In early 2019, El Nuevo Día newspaper in Puerto Rico began listing the names of the cadavers that would be exhumed and moved to other cemeteries, a long and delicate process. On March 4, an update was given by Lares officials on how the issue was being handled.  On May 10, 2019, it was announced that a decision had been made to build a temporary wooden structure separating the affected area so that family members could visit the plots that were unaffected by the hurricane-triggered landslides.  The Bravo Family Foundation sent relief to Lares, in the immediate aftermath.  \\n\nThe December 2019 and January 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes caused 28 families in Lares to lose their homes.  \\n\nGeography\nLares is a mountainous municipality located in the central western part of the island of Puerto Rico. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau , the municipality has a total area of 61.64 square miles (159.6 km 2 ), of which 61.45 square miles (159.2 km 2 ) is land and .09 square miles (0.23 km 2 ) is water.  \\n\nThere are 10 caves in Lares.

It is called Alturas de Castañer (Castañer Heights) and there the families work to grow coffee, bananas and other crops which are sold to markets, and restaurants nearby.  \\n\nDemographics\nLike most of Puerto Rico, Lares population originated with the Taino Indians and then many immigrants from Spain settled the central highland, most prominently the Andalusian , Canarian and Extremaduran Spanish migration who formed the bulk of the Jibaro or white peasant stock of the island.  The Andalusian, Canarian and Extremaduran Spaniards also influenced much of the Puerto Rican culture which explains the use of Spanish and the Spanish architecture that can be found in the city.\\n\nGovernment\nThe mayor of Lares for fifteen years was Roberto Pagán Centeno and he resigned in late 2019.  José Rodríguez Ruiz began serving his term as mayor of Lares on January 20, 2020.

The flag is modeled after the flag of the First Dominican Republic and the flag of Cuba , reflecting the revolutionaries idea to unite the Spanish-speaking Greater Antilles of Puerto Rico , Cuba , and the Dominican Republic in Hispaniola into an Antillean Confederation . The flag was first knitted by Mariana Bracetti at the behest of Ramón Emeterio Betances , leader of the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico . \\n\nTh flag consists of a white cross in the center that extends to its four sides, with four equal rectangles, two located on top and two below the arms of the cross.

Loíza is spread over five barrios and Loíza Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . It is renowned for its rich Afro-Puerto Rican culture and heritage.\\n\nHistory\nSome say its name comes from a female cacique , named Loaíza or Yuíza, who governed the region formerly called Haimanio, on the shores of the Río Grande de Loíza . It is said that this cacique might have married a mulatto conquistador called Pedro Mejías, but there is no evidence of this.

It is a small town set around a small square in hilly terrain, north of San Germán , Sabana Grande and Yauco ; south of Las Marías and Lares , southeast of Mayagüez , and west of Adjuntas . Maricao is spread over 6 barrios and Maricao Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city).\\n\nThe town borders the Maricao Fish Hatchery , a fish hatchery made up of tanks and pools in a garden setting, where some 25,000 fish are raised yearly to stock farm fishponds and island lakes.  The hatchery is part of the Maricao State Forest , also known as Monte del Estado . Though of dryer vegetation than the other mountain forest, Maricao is home to large number of bird species . Its stone observation tower provides far-flung views to the coast and the Mona Passage .\\n\nMaricao has a 2020 census population of 4,455.  \\n\nHistory\nMaricao was founded on April 1, 1874, when Bernardo Collado, Julián Ayala, Francisco M. Sojo, Napoleón Pietri and Leoncio S. Martínez requested the Provincial Deputation authorization to establish an official town. It originally belonged to the district of San Germán , but they alleged the roads were too long and almost impassable. Their request made references to a parish already established in 1866.\\n\nDuring the 19th century coffee boom, Maricao and other regions surged economically. When the spurt of coffee in the island ended by the start of the 20th century, the economic conditions deteriorated again. Many of the old plantation houses have been turned into museums to stimulate the tourism industry. While Puerto Rico still has a niche in the gourmet coffee market, the large scale coffee growing which built Maricao is no longer economically feasible.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a colony of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Maricao was 8,312.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.

Elderly were especially affected.  \\n\nGeography\nMaricao is mountainous and rugged and belongs to the Western portion of the Cordillera Central .  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Maricao is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .    \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Maricao: Llanadas, El 30 (Sector Los Mercados) in Indiera Alta, La Cuchilla, Los Cuadros-Montoso, and Villa Esperanza.   \\n\nCulture\nDue to its importance as a coffee producer in the past, some of Maricao\\'s coffee haciendas were turned into museums or guest houses: Hacienda Delicias and Hacienda Juanita , which has since closed. Other places for tourists to visit are the Bambúa Recreational Center and the Maricao Fish Nursery . Some natural spots to visit are the Monte del Estado forest reserve, the Maricao River Natural Protected Area, the Prieto Lake and the Salto de Curet waterfall.\\n\nMaricao celebrates its patron saint festival in June. The Fiestas Patronales de San Juan Bautista is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nKnown locally as the Festival del Acabe de Café , the End of the Coffee Harvest Festival is celebrated on President\\'s Day weekend in February.  It celebrates the tradition wherein the Hacienda owners would provide a feast for their workers at the end of the coffee harvest. The festival was founded in 1977 by then mayor, Vicente Byron.\\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Maricao include:\\n\nEconomy\nFor decades, Maricao\\'s economy has relied on agriculture , specifically coffee plantations. Fruits and vegetables are also grown in the town. Currently only one factory is established in Maricao, Fenwal Blood Technologies . Devices and materials that are used in blood donation, transfusion, transportation and storage are produced there. Tourism has also played an important role in the town\\'s economy.\\n\nFor two decades, this municipality has had the highest level of children living in poverty in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2000 census, Maricao is the second least populous municipality in Puerto Rico , above the island municipality of Culebra , with 6,449 inhabitants. The 2020 census shows the municipality remains the second least populated with a population of 4,455. The population of the town has decreased during the past decades in part due to the decline in coffee production and the deteriorating economy. In 1899, the population was 8,312. Making the population density is 174.2 people per square mile (67.0/km 2 ).\\n\nAs a whole, Puerto Rico is mainly made up of people from a Criollo (born on the Island of European descent) or Spanish and European descent, with small groups of African and Asian people . Statistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 90.3% of Maricaeños have Spanish or White origin, 3.0% are black , 0.2% are Amerindian etc. The majority of the local population are partly descended from pre Columbian indigenous inhabitants.\\n\nThere is a general consensus in Puerto Rico that the barrios of Indieras in Maricao have the most people of indigenous origin in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nGovernment\nMaricao\\'s first mayor was Juan Ferrer y Arnijas, whose term ran from 1874 to 1876. Gilberto Pérez Valentín , alias \"El Enano\" or the Dwarf,  was mayor for a seven consecutive terms until he lost his seat in 2020 to Wilfredo \"Juny\" Ruiz .  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two senators. In 2016, Luis Berdiel and Nelson Cruz , from the New Progressive Party , were elected as district senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag of Maricao derives its colors, design and symbolism from the municipal shield. It consists of a green cloth, with the three usual dimensions of the municipal flags of Puerto Rico , crossing from an end to another a yellow band with three points. The color green symbolizes the vegetation of the municipality and the yellow band symbolizes the mountains of the region.  \\n\nIn a silver field, resides an inverted V-shaped green band. Contained in the band are five golden huts. To either side and below the band are a total of three Maricao ( Byrsonima spicata ) tree branches with flowers. Surrounding the shield below and to either side are two coffee tree branches. Above it is placed a gold mural crown with three towers outlined in black with green doors and windows.  \\n\nThe origin of its name has two versions. It is said to come from the name of the Maricao tree ( Byrsonima spicata ) which has yellow flowers and grows in the region. The second version is a legend about a Taíno woman called María that, during the Spanish colonization , fell in love with a Spanish soldier. She informed him of an attack planned by her tribe and the Spanish took the offensive. María was then taken prisoner by her people and tried for treason . As was the tradition, she was tied to a tree and sacrificed. Allegedly \"cao\" means \" sacrifice \" so Maricao means \"María\\'s sacrifice\"; this is considered folk etymology .\\n\nEducation\nMaricao has several public and private schools distributed through several regions. Public education is handled by the Puerto Rico Department of Education .\\n\nTransportation\nThere is no direct highway connection to Maricao. Puerto Rico Highway 119 and Puerto Rico Highway 120 lead from the north, while Puerto Rico Highway 121 and Puerto Rico Highway 105 lead from the south. Maricao lies about three hours from San Juan .\\n\nThere are 13 bridges in Maricao.  \\n\nNotable natives and residents\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMaunabo, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nMaunabo  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Maunabo Valley on the southeastern coast, northeast of Patillas and south of Yabucoa . Maunabo is spread over eight barrios and Maunabo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . The current mayor of the town is Jorge L. Márquez Pérez and the population in 2020 was 10,589.\\n\nHistory\nMaunabo was founded in 1799. Maunabo derives its name from a Taino name Manatuabón for the Maunabo River .  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Maunabo was 6,221.  \\n\nMaunabo is known for its advances in media. Being almost \"disconnected\" from the rest of the island by its high mountains, the maunabeños created their own newspaper called La Esquina  (\"The Corner\" in English ) on August 30, 1975 by Ramón \"Chito\" Arroyo and José Orlando Rivera. It started as a community one-sheeter distributed free of charge only in Maunabo, but its popularity was so overwhelming that a year later it was transformed into a monthly tabloid. Today, the paper still is free of charge, home delivering 40,000 copies not only in Maunabo but also in the southeastern towns of Guayama , Arroyo , Patillas , Yabucoa and Humacao , and read by more than 190,000 people. Recently, the paper opened its new offices in Maunabo where they also work on La Esquina Online and other projects.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. The hurricane triggered numerous landslides in Maunabo with its 155 mph winds and rain.   The electric company ( Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica ) stated restoring power to Maunabo could take up to 9 months. The mayor said all small businesses were affected and all minor fruits were lost.  \\n\nGeography\nMaunabo is surrounded by high mountains on two sides.  The three major peaks are Pico Hutton on Sierra de Guardarraya with an elevation of 1,799 feet (548 m); Cerro Santa Elena also known as El Sombrerito (the \"little hat\" for its unusual shape) on Sierra Pandura with an elevation of 1,722 feet (525 m); and Cerro de la Pandura with an elevation of 1,692 feet (516 m). The wind on these high points is so strong that it is hard to hear anything else but it blowing past your ears. At Sierra Guardarraya the strong winds have affected the growth of vegetation and the tall grass only grows flat to the ground.\\n\nIn the lush and tropical vegetation of Cerro de la Pandura you will find one of the Island\\'s most endangered species of coquí . Known as the coquí Guajón ( Eleutherodactylus cooki ), this coquí frog can be found in the mountains shared by the neighboring municipalities of Yabucoa , Patillas and San Lorenzo . Though discovered in 1932 by Chapman Grant of the U.S. Army , it was not until 1997 that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared  it an endangered species .\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Maunabo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .    \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Maunabo: Matuyas, Sector García in Talante, and Batey Columbia in Calzada.   \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nMauna Caribe, a parador which is a local type of bed and breakfast , tropical inn, is located in Maunabo.  \\nWith an almost unspoiled culture\\xe2\\x80\\x94due to the high mountains that separate the town from the rest\\xe2\\x80\\x94Maunabo still is a bucolic city and the lack of large commercial chains gives it a unique personality compared to the rest of the island.\\n\nThe warm, unspoiled and untamed blue and green waters of the beaches of Maunabo are one of its major attractions. The three beaches (Los Bohios, Los Pinos and Playa Punta Tuna) are mostly visited by the locals all year round. The beaches also attract tourists that explore other regions beyond San Juan and other major cities. Surfers love these wild and dangerous waters. The Punta Tuna beach is also known by the locals as Playa Escondida or the \"hidden beach\", crowned by the Punta Tuna Lighthouse on one side and separated from the main road by lush sea grape trees on the other. The beach is only accessible by foot through a short dusty road.\\n\nThe sand at Los Pinos Beach (the name means \"the pines\" and it comes from a pine-tree-lined hill on the side of the beach) shines with black carbon minerals and legend has it that these come from sea volcanoes or from underwater fossil fuel deposits. The minerals tend to stick to anything that is wet and thus it is rarely visited.\\n\nThe Los Bohios Beach is another popular beach in the municipality, attracting thousands of visitors each year.   \\n\nThe town is also known for its Punta Tuna Lighthouse  built by the Spanish at the end of the 19th century before the Island was turned over to the United States as spoils of the Spanish-American War of 1898. Though it has never ceased working under the active management of the U.S. Coast Guard, for almost 30 years the lighthouse was not accessible to the public. Due to Law 180  presented by Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá , the doors of the lighthouse were opened once again to the public in February 2006. The lighthouse is also a permanent symbol in the town\\'s coat of arms.  \\n\nThe town is also known for its annual crab carnival \"Festi-Carnaval Jueyero \" which attracts thousands of visitors for a three-day celebration with live music, street fairs, contests and much crab-based food. The carnival is celebrated during the first week of September, at the peak of the summer heat.  \\n\nCulture\nMaunabo celebrates its patron saint festival in May. The Fiestas Patronales San Pedro y San Isidro Labrador is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Maunabo include:\\n\nEconomy\nComité Pro Desarrollo de Maunabo (The Committee for the Development of Maunabo) has been active for years and in 2018 worked on upgrades to Casa Verde , a hurricane relief location in Maunabo.   \\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Maunabo is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Jorge L. Márquez Pérez , from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Márquez was elected at the 2000 general election .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VII , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Jorge Suárez and José Luis Dalmau were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nMaunabo\\'s flag consists of a green cloth crossed diagonally by a white stripe. In each corner of the two remaining green triangles, there are two yellow ox yokes.  \\n\nThis municipality has a coat of arms. Silver and green are the main colors of the shield, representing flowered sugarcane.  The upside down V symbolizes the mountains of Maunabo: Sierra de Guarderraya and Sierra de la Pandura. A lighthouse is a representation of Maunabo\\'s oldest building, which is located on the Maunabo coast. The yokes are symbols of agriculture and Maunabo\\'s patron saint, San Isidro Labrador .  \\n\nTransportation\nThe town constructed a tunnel which goes under a mountain, in this case, the eastern side mountains, (there is a vehicular tunnel that was built previously, in San Juan, the Minillas Tunnel , but that one goes under some buildings instead) connecting it with the neighboring town of Yabucoa .  A Chilean construction company is in charge of the contract. The tunnels have been named Vicente Morales Lebrón, after an environmental activist who, as a result of the 1956 tropical storm Betsy that damaged the only road that connected the town with the north side of the island, proposed the tunnels to be built.  In September 2018, the tunnel was closed briefly for the filming of a music video.  \\n\nThere are 22 bridges in Maunabo.  \\n\nGallery\nNotable residents\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMayagüez, Puerto Rico\n\\n\\n\nMayagüez  is the ninth-largest  municipality in Puerto Rico . It was founded as Pueblo de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Mayagüez (Township of Our Lady of Candelaria ), and is also known as La Sultana del Oeste (The Sultaness of the West), Ciudad de las Aguas Puras (City of Pure Waters), or Ciudad del Mangó (Mango City). On April 6, 1894, the Spanish Crown granted it the formal title of Excelente Ciudad de Mayagüez (Excellent City of Mayagüez).   Mayagüez is located in the center of the western coast on the island of Puerto Rico. It has a population of 73,077, and it is the principal city of the Mayagüez Metropolitan Statistical Area (pop. 213,831) and the Mayagüez-Aguadilla, PR Combined Statistical Area (pop. 467,599).  \\n\nHistory\nThe Mayagüez Metro Area (and part of Añasco ) lies today on two former Taíno Cacicazgos (chiefdoms) : Yaguex and Yagüeca, a region noted for its record of colonial resistance (i.e., Urayoán and Legend of Diego Salcedo ). The Tainos constituted the majority of the island\\'s inhabitants at the time of contact with Europeans in 1493 and called it Borikén or Borinquen . Today, this appellation and its variations continue to designate the Island of Puerto Rico and its people. The Taínos came from South American branches of Arawakan speakers , more specifically from modern-day Venezuela , and lived in small villages, organized their society in clans and named their chiefs Cacique . They were farmers who domesticated crops as pineapples , cassava , and sweet potatoes supplemented by fish and seafood. [ citation needed ] \\n\nMayagüez was founded on September 18, 1760, by a group led by brothers Faustino and Lorenzo Martínez de Matos, Juan de Silva and Juan de Aponte, at a hill located about one kilometer inland from Mayagüez Bay and the outlet of the Yagüez River . The Spanish Crown granted the founders the right to self-government in 1763, formally separating the town from the larger Partido de San Germán . The settlement was named Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Mayagüez ( Our Lady of Candelaria of Mayagüez ) to evoke an apparition of the Virgin Mary on the island of Tenerife , one of the Canary Islands . Most of the town\\'s settlers, including its founders , migrated from the archipelago, whose patron saint is the Virgin of Candelaria .\\n\nOn May 7, 1836, the settlement was elevated to the royal status of villa , and Rafael Mangual was named its first mayor. At the time, the villa\\'s principal economic activity was agriculture. The famous patriot, educator, sociologist, philosopher, essayist and novelist Eugenio María de Hostos was born in Mayagüez in 1839. On July 10, 1877, the villa received its city charter from the Royal Crown of Spain.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States.In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Mayagüez was 35,700, making it one of the largest towns in Puerto Rico at the time.  \\n\nThe city\\'s main Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of the Candelaria , was built in a plot consecrated on August 21, 1760. Its first masonry building was erected in 1780. The current church was built in 1836, and was rebuilt in 1922. The redesign by architect Luis Perocier sought to restore the building to its original splendor. The 1918 San Fermín earthquake had destroyed the temple\\'s ceiling, and a lightning bolt struck and tore down a wedge-shaped corner of one of its two bell towers. However, lack of proper funding and the extent of the damage of the original structure forced the rebuilding to be scaled-down considerably.  \\n\n\\nIn 1911, the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts was founded in Mayagüez. Today it is known as the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM)\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Caribbean \\'s leading engineering institution.\nBetween 1962 and 1998 Mayagüez was a major tuna canning and processing center. At one time, 80% of all tuna products consumed in the United States were packed in Mayagüez (the biggest employer, StarKist , had 11,000 employees working three daily shifts in the local plant\\'s heyday). Mayagüez was also a major textile industry hub; almost a quarter of all drill uniforms used by the United States Army were sewn in the city. Today, Mayagüez is the fifth-largest city in Puerto Rico and is considered one of the most important cities in the island. The city is centered on the impressive Spanish-style main square Plaza Colón , a tribute to Christopher Columbus , whose statue stands in the middle of the square, surrounded by 16 bronze statues.\\n\nMayagüez has become a major college town with the establishment of the UPRM , the now closed Eugenio María de Hostos Law School  and the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico .\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Mayagüez, losses were described as \"catastrophic\".  The storm triggered numerous landslides in Mayagüez. In some areas of Mayagüez, there were over 25 landslides per square mile due to the deluge.   \\n\nGeography\nMayagüez is located near the geographical center of the west coast of Puerto Rico about two to three hours by automobile from San Juan . Its land area is 77.6 square miles (201.06 km 2 ).  The city\\'s terrain includes; coast plains, river valleys, marshland, hills and mountains. Of its multiple rivers and streams, the two most important are the Río Yagüez , which flows from the Central Mountain Range through downtown until it empties into the Mona Passage ; and the Río Guanajibo , which flows through several neighborhoods in the southern portion of the municipality until it empties in the Mona Passage .  \\n\nThe Desecheo National Wildlife Refuge on Desecheo Island is a protected area.\\n\nTo the north of the El Maní community in Mayagüez is the Boquilla Creek Wildlife Reserve ( Reserva Natural del Caño de la Boquilla ), a protected area and the habitat of endangered species .    \\n\nClimate\nMayagüez has a tropical savanna climate ( K\\xc3\\xb6ppen climate classification Aw ). The city has the most extreme weather of the island. The high frequency of severe storms in the summer can produce strong winds, floods , waterspouts , and sometimes hail and even tornadoes . The average annual temperature is 75 °F or 23.9 °C. Winter is usually quite dry and warm, with temperatures between 82 °F or 27.8 °C and 55 °F or 12.8 °C. Summer is usually very hot and humid, with temperatures reaching 95 °F or 35 °C, with heat index of up to 115 °F or 46.1 °C. From May to October, most evenings experience strong thunderstorms, due to heat, humidity and the topography of the area.\\n\nCityscape\nThe municipio has an estimated population of just over 100,000 spread over 21 barrios ( barrios ) including Mayagüez Pueblo (The downtown area and the administrative center of the city). One of the barrios is Isla de Mona e Islote Monito , which consists of the offshore islands of Mona Island and Monito Island . This is the largest ward by land area and at the same time the only one without any permanent population. Also, uninhabited Desecheo Island belongs to the municipality as part of Sabanetas barrio .     \\n\nMayagüez Pueblo is further subdivided into these barrios:\\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nThe sectors that comprise Mayagüez City are:\\n\nOther notable neighborhoods or sectors:\\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion .

It faced a major economic downturn due to the closure of its textile factories and tuna industry, which were the principal industries of the city for the greater part of the 20th century. Over 11,000 permanent jobs in these two industries were lost in the city during the 1990s, and because of this, Mayagüez became the jurisdiction of the United States with the second most industrial job losses during the time, second only to Flint, Michigan . Once the third city in population and importance in Puerto Rico, population numbers for it have been relatively stagnant, and it has lost population.\\n\nMayagüez has a floating population due to its universities, principally the University of Puerto Rico- Mayagüez Campus of about 15,000-20,000 which contributes considerably to its economy.\\n\nIn 2005 Winston-Salem Industries for The Blind was the first industry to move into the city\\'s industrial park in many years. In July 2007 Honeywell opened a customer support service center for its aerospace and information technology divisions in the city.\\n\nAs of 2022, Bureau of Labor Statistics data revealed that the Mayagüez metropolitan area had the worst-paid lawyers in the United States, with an annual average salary of only $53,850.  \\n\nCulture\nMayagüez\\'s contributions to Puerto Rican gastronomy have been many, and a few of these are known outside Puerto Rico.

In addition to running the city\\'s day-to-day operations and supervising associated departments, the mayor is also responsible for appointing a secretary-auditor and a treasurer.\\n\nMayagüez\\'s Municipal Assembly comprises sixteen elected officials, as defined in the Puerto Rico Law of Autonomous Municipalities of 1991.\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial District IV , which is represented by two Senators.\\n\nLaw enforcement in Mayagüez is the joint responsibility of the Mayagüez Municipal Police Department and the Puerto Rico Police Department . The first fire fighters corps in the city was created in 1876.  \\n\nThe city has three Puerto Rico Police (State Police) facilities and one Municipal Police station, it also has the regional office of the State Emergency Management Bureau(NMEAD) as well as the offices of the Puerto Rico Seismic Network(Red Sismica de Puerto Rico) and the Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program who share facilities in the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez Campus.\\n\nIt has numerous private ambulance service organizations which covered wide parts of the western coast of Puerto Rico and choose Mayagüez for its central location to the region.\\n\nThere are small volunteer organizations dedicated to aiding police and emergency services as requested by such.\\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe wide cross represents Christianity brought to the New World by Christopher Columbus ,  who signed his documents with the phrase and the motto Christ Ferens , which means: \"He who has Christ.\" The blue and white waves between the third and fourth quarters recall the coat of arms granted to Columbus by kings Ferdinand and Isabella . The waves represent the ocean (and particularly the Mona Passage ) through which he sailed to bring the gospel to these new lands. The blue and white waves symbolize the Yagüez River and evokes the nickname City of Pure Waters . The red and white flames on the flag symbolize the traditional bonfires of Day of Our Lady of Candelaria (\"Día de La Candelaria\"), ignited in honor of the city\\'s patron saint (a tradition started for Spanish settlers from the Canary Islands ).  The flag was officially adopted with the signing of City Ordinance 38, signed December 3, 1996.  \\n\nAccording to the Puerto Rican historian Federico Cedó Alzamora, the original version of the coat of arms of Mayagüez was given to the city December 19, 1894, by the Queen Regent of Spain Maria Christina of Austria .  The upper half of the coat of arms shows the columbine coat of arms recalls and commemorates the discovery of the Island of Borinquén (Puerto Rico) by Columbus in his second trip to the New World in 1493. The lower half of the coat of arms shows a stylized version of Columbus\\'s landing on Puerto Rico. The explorer\\'s crew disembarked at the western coast of the island,  where several rivers spill their waters in the Mona Passage, among them the Yagüez, from which the name of Mayagüez is derived. The present version was reinterpreted by heraldist Roberto Biascochea Lota.\\n\nThe city\\'s anthem was written by pianist and former music teacher Luciano Quiñones ,  a long-time resident and now \"adopted son\" of the city. Until this song\\'s adoption, the plena \" A Mayagüez \", written by César Concepción , was used by many as an unofficial city song. Quiñones\\' composition was the winner of a contest sponsored by the city\\'s municipality in 2003.  \\n\nMayor José Guillermo Rodríguez and the Municipal Legislature entrusted the Advisory Board of Art and Culture of Mayagüez to hold a contest to select an anthem for the city.  The selected composition was a danza by Mr Luciano Quiñones, who has a bachelor\\'s degree in music, a piano professor the Escuela Libre de Música de Mayagüez, he is a music composer already winning nineteen abarrios in competitions held by the Institute of Puerto Rican culture, and the Circulo de Recreo de San Germán.  The lyrics alludes to the emblematic symbols of Mayagüez; its nicknames, to its Patron Saint , its taste of mango , to its sunsets in the bay , to the Taíno , to Eugenio María de Hostos , their role as cultural cradle, the sympathy of the ladies and the dream of its valleys and its mountains.  \\n\nThe anthem was presented to the people in a memorable concert held in commemoration of the 239 anniversary of the founding of the city on the night of September 18, 1999, interpreted by tenor, Mayagüez adopted son, Rafael José Díaz, Mayagüezana lyric soprano, Hilda Ramos, accompanied by the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra conducted by its Associate Director, Mayagüezana Roselyn Pabón, in the same place where such Symphony Orchestra offered his first concert forty years earlier: the Plaza Colón .  This danza was recognized as the official anthem of Mayagüez through the Municipal Ordinance number 58, series 1999-2000, adopted on December 20, 1999, by the City Council, which was signed by the Mayor, Honorable José Guillermo Rodríguez on December 24, 1999.  \\n\nMIDI and recorded versions of the anthem can be listened to here.  \\n\nEducation\nThe Residential Center for Educative Opportunities of Mayagüez , ( CROEM ) is one of only two public boarding schools in Puerto Rico. The largest public high school in town is Eugenio María de Hostos High School. The other public high school in Mayagüez is Dr. Pedro Perea Fajardo Vocational High School. The former José De Diego High School was finally closed in 2009.\\n\nThe non-profit Southwestern Educational Society (SESO) maintains the Southwestern Community School, an English language college preparatory school. Other private schools include: Colegio San Benito , (CSB) ( Saint Benedict College), the Academia de la Inmaculada Concepción (Academy of the Immaculate Conception), Colegio De La Milagrosa (College of Our Lady of Miracles), the Academia Adventista del Oeste (Western Adventist Academy) and Academia Adventista de Bella Vista (Bella Vista Adventist Academy), Theopolis Christian Academy (TCA)\\n\nMayagüez has become a major college town , due in part to various higher learning institutions in the city.\\n\nThere are also a number of junior colleges in the city:\\n\nTransportation\nThe dominant mode of transportation in Puerto Rico is the automobile. Mayagüez is served by two highways linking it to other parts of the island.\\n\nPuerto Rico Highway 2 existing as an arterial road is a primary route between Ponce to the south-east and Aguadilla and Arecibo to the north and north-east respectively. PR-2 is undergoing a conversion to a freeway between Ponce and Mayagüez.  \\n\nAnother important route in Mayagüez is PR-102 . It begins at an intersection with PR-2, about 2 miles north of Mayagüez Pueblo at the Mar y Sol development and runs along Mayagüez\\'s coastal industrial areas to Joyuda , where it then turns east and terminates in Sabana Grande .\\n\nThe portion of the highway adjacent to the Estadio Isidoro Garcia was upgraded from a two-lane road into an urban boulevard in anticipation of the 2010 Centro-American and Caribbean Games celebrated in Mayagüez. In addition to this upgrade, an elevated by-pass was constructed from the coastal park site over the Yagüez River ending at the Concordia Housing Project.\\n\nThere are 41 bridges in Mayagüez.  \\n\nTransportation in Mayagüez is limited to a trolley service, various private taxi companies and an occasional daytime syndicated público service named Mayagüez Urbano (Urban Mayagüez) that provide transportation between the main points of the city at a cost of $2.00 per route. Passenger transportation between Mayagüez and San Juan is operated by the Linea Sultana, another syndicated service.  \\n\nThe city operates three trolleys, free of charge, which run as shuttles between the downtown area and the Palacio de Recreación y Deportes .  \\n\nThe University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM) also runs an internal network of trolleys to carry its students inside campus and between UPRM\\'s Mayagüez Terrace development and Palacio de Recreación y Deportes,  linking here with the city\\'s trolley service. There are some proposals to expand the municipal trolley service to serve inside the UPRM.  \\n\nFor the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games the Puerto Rico\\'s Department of Transportation and Public Works released an express public bus system operated with Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses (San Juan\\'s Metropolitan Bus Authority) buses specially assigned to serve the city of Mayagüez. During the Mayagüez 2010 Games , this bus network was carrying passengers in a corridor along Highway 2 and some main roads. The UPRM trolleybus network was integrated into this service too. Although suspended after the Mayagüez 2010 Games ended, the system is expected to be re-established shortly.  \\n\nThe Port of Mayagüez is the third busiest port in Puerto Rico.  It was base for several years to several tuna and fish companies who made the port a considerable busy one. It was normal to see 3 to 4 ships docked at any given day but due to the Section 936 termination the industries started to leave until 2000 approximately when only the ferry and the Federacion de Industria Agropecuaria silos pier were left. It is located northwest of the central business district along Puerto Rico routes 64, 341, and 3341, and stretches for 3.8 miles (6.1 km) along the coast. Its main canal is 0.4 miles (0.64 km) wide and its depth ranges from 47 to 120 feet (14 to 37 m), the water\\'s depth along the piers ranges between 28 and 29 feet (8.5 and 8.8 m). The port is protected from rough seas by reefs which run along its northern and western sections.  \\n\nOn March 16, 2011, a new ferry service to the Dominican Republic was launched by America Cruise Ferries .  \\nLate 2016 the municipal administration awarded an administration contract to a private company after years of legal disputes and non-complying groups involved. The municipal administration had plans of development for the port back to 2004 when they received a portion of port area from the central government (the ferry pier and terminal) but 12 years later the port has seen little to no progress.\\n\nMayagüez\\'s airport, Eugenio María de Hostos Airport , also known as El Maní Airport, has had regular airline services for more than thirty years.  It is located 4 miles (6.4 km) north of the central business district in the Sabanetas barrio. Before being inaugurated in 1955, the airport served as a military base. In the 1970s it had domestic service from Prinair , then from American Eagle and Eastern Air Lines \\'s regional carrier Eastern Metro Express in the 1980s. After Eastern went bankrupt in 1991, American Eagle remained the only airline serving the airport until it ended service to the city on April 30, 2005, due to poor loads.  For a while, Fina Air served flights to the Dominican Republic before the airline went bankrupt. Cape Air currently serves the airport with five daily flights to San Juan during the high season and three daily flights during the low season.  \\n\nNotable people\nInternational relations\nMayagüez serves as a host city for two foreign consulates with business in Puerto Rico:\\n\nBook\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

Moca is spread over 12 barrios and Moca Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center). It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nThe name comes from the Moca tree ( Andira inermis ) which are very common in this region.\\n\nThe Moca tree was officially adopted as the representative tree of the town on February 19, 1972. Moca is famous for its Mundillo lace. Mundillo is a Puerto Rican-style of handmade bobbin lace . Mundillo almost synonymous with the small town of Moca.\\n\nHistory\nMoca, known as La Capital del Mundillo (The Mundillo Capital), is famous for its lace or Mundillo . It was founded by Don José de Quiñones on June 22, 1772. Diverse versions exist on the date of its foundation. Manuel de Ubeda and Delgado , in his \" Isla de Puerto Rico. \"Estudio histórico, geográfico y estadístico\" , published in San Juan in 1878, says Moca was founded in 1774. On the other hand, Cayetano Coll y Toste , in the \" Boletín histórico de Puerto Rico \", maintains it was founded on June 22, 1772.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States .In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Moca was 12,410.  \\n\nOn May 16, 2010, Moca was the epicenter of a strong 5.8 earthquake . The earthquake was felt in the entire island and also in the Dominican Republic and the Virgin Islands . Damage was reported in various towns.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Moca, landslides and the flooding of the Río Culebrinas caused major destruction to bridges, roads and homes.    About 1300 homes were impacted by landslides and flooding, bridges collapsed, and residents were left without access to electrical power, telecommunication services and basic necessities. Close to a month and a half later, 25% of the 31,117 residents of Moca had electrical power and access to drinking water and 75% did not.  \\n\nGeography\nMoca is located on the northwest part of the island on the northern karst region of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nClimate: Tropical with hardly noticeable seasonal changes, temperatures in Moca range from highs of between76 and 98 °F (24 and 37 °C) and lows between 50 and 75 °F (10 and 24 °C).\\n\nHydrography: The Río Culebrinas crosses its territory from east to west, and its tributaries include the gorges of Los Gatos, Lassalle, de las Damas, Vieja, Los Romanes, the Morones, Higuillo, Chiquita, Yagruma, Echeverria, Aguas Frias, Las Marias, de los Méndez, La Caraíma, Grande, y Dulce. Cerro Moca, Monte El Ojo, Monte Mariquita of the Jaicoa Mountain Range.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Moca is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio called Moca barrio-pueblo.     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of Puerto Rico. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Moca: Aceituna, Sector Isleta in Cruz barrio, Parcelas Acevedo and Parcelas Mamey in Moca barrio-pueblo, and Loperena.  \\n\nDemographics\nIn 2020, the U.S. Census indicated that Moca had a total population of 37,012 inhabitants, a 7.7% decline from 2010.  \\n\nEconomy\nTourism\nCulture\nMoca celebrates its patron saint festival in late August or early September. The Fiestas Patronales Nuestra Señora de la Monserrate is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nMoca has a Double-A (baseball) team called the Moca Vampiros that play in the Superior Baseball League .\\n\nMoca also had a volleyball team named Los Rebeldes , which played in LVS (Liga de Voleibol Superior) from 1998 to 2005. The team went to the post season every year, and obtained a controversial second place in its 1998 final with Los Changos of Naranjito. In addition, Los Rebeldes were National Champions against Los Changos in the 2000 final. Los Rebeldes swept the Los Changos 4-0 in the finals.\\n\nMoca is famous for El vampiro de Moca (Spanish for \"Moca vampire \"), considered a predecessor to the Chupacabra urban legend. Although there have been reports of vampire-like attacks on farm animals from as early as the 1930s, El vampiro de Moca legend officially began on February 25, 1975, when newspapers reported that fifteen cows, three goats, two geese and a pig were found with puncture marks on their blood-drained bodies in Rocha, Moca . These events were also connected to UFO sightings and other supernatural reports by residents of Moca. Similar events were reported throughout 1975 in the towns of Corozal , Fajardo and even rural parts of San Juan .   The legend resurfaced in the 1990s after similar reports came from Canóvanas .  \\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Moca is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is José Avilés Santiago , from the New Progressive Party (PNP). Avilés was elected at the 2000 general election .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district IV , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, María Teresa González and Gilberto Rodríguez were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nTransportation\nThere are 12 bridges in Moca.  Moca, like the rest of Puerto Rico, had a public share taxi system or Carros Públicos , with set routes.   \\n\nAguadilla airport is a commercial airport which is nearby.\\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nAugusto Hernández Méndez designed Moca\\'s flag. The rectangular flag consists of a magenta equilateral triangular field, the color of the Moca tree flower. In this field appear five-point stars, silver-plated, surrounding a greater gold star, also with five points.  \\n\nIt has oblong form. Divided in a silver-plated field and blue sky united by a purple rhombus (diamond shape), the color of the Moca flower. The rhombus has religious symbolisms. The rhombus is surrounded, in its inferior part, by two branches of the Moca tree; in its superior part, an arc of eleven silver-plated five-point stars. Within the rhombus is a gold monogram (of the Virgin Mary ) topped by a Christian crown of the same metal. A silver-lined crown in form of a three-tower castle crowns the shield. On the frontal portion of the crown, carved in gold, the word Moca . The stones of the castle are lined in blue. The doors and windows are purple.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

Morovis is spread over 13 barrios and Morovis Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city).  It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nIn 1815, a group of residents, under the leadership of Don Juan José de la Torre, began the process to separate Morovis from Manatí . In 1817, the government of Puerto Rico approved the separation, but it was not until 1818 that the requirements of a population of one thousand residents and the construction of a church and several other public buildings was fulfilled, that the municipality of Morovis was officially founded. In 1822, the mayorship was constructed and in 1823, the new church was built, dedicated to Nuestra Señora del Carmen on lands donated by Don Juan Evangelista Rivera. Its first mayor was Don Juan José de la Torre, with its second mayor being Don Juan Evangelista Rivera.  \\nMorovis has a particular nickname. It was the only municipality in Puerto Rico that did not suffer from a cholera epidemic in 1853; as a result, a common phrase, \"la isla menos Morovis\" (\" (all of) the island but Morovis \") was coined. The phrase is believed by Puerto Ricans from outside of the town to have a negative connotation against moroveños , while, in reality, it is considered a positive motto.\\n\nIn 1875, Abino Casellas was mayor of Morovis and in 1879, Cruz Maria Castro was mayor.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Morovis was 11,309.  \\n\nMorovis is a mountainous municipality with an area of approximately 100.3 square kilometres (38.7 sq mi), located slightly north of the center of the island,  which was hit particularly hard by Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017. With a 2016 estimate of 31,603 residents at the time, 1500 to 2000 homes lost their roof and 500 wooden homes were completed destroyed. Roads and bridges were impacted by landslides and flooding, and residents were left without access to electrical power, telecommunication services and basic necessities for many months.  \\n\nThe community in San Lorenzo , a barrio of Morovis with about 1,000 people, was left isolated when the bridge into the barrio was washed away by the Morovis River .    \\n\nThen mayor of Morovis, Carmen Maldonado delivered food to residents, the municipal town hall became a food distribution center and she arranged for the purchase and delivery of a water truck to provide clean water daily to the residents who did not have access to clean water.    \\n\nMaldonado spoke to New York governor Andrew Cuomo , requesting his help and Cuomo responded by contacting H.e.a.r.t. 9/11 , a non-profit organization. In early 2019, Maldonado received and thanked volunteers from H.e.a.r.t. 9/11 , mostly carpenters who came to Morovis to repair and rebuild homes damaged by the hurricane.  In late 2019, H.e.a.r.t. 9/11 was still rebuilding roofs in Morovis.   \\n\nGeography\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Morovis is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located near the center of the municipality, in a small barrio referred to as \"Pueblo\" .    \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.     \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth.

It was built to replace the existing Puerto Rico National Cemetery located in Bayamón which reached capacity.   Construction was underway in 2019   with interments slated to begin in 2021.  \\n\nEconomy\nAn Energy Consortium was signed in late February, 2019 by the mayors of Villalba , Orocovis , Morovis, Ciales and Barranquitas municipalities. The consortium is the first of its kind for Puerto Rico. It is intended to have those municipalities work together to safeguard and create resilient, and efficient energy networks, with backups for their communities. This is part of the hurricane preparedness plan of these municipalities, which were hit particularly hard by Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017.  \\n\nTourism\nA well-known landmark in Morovis is The Red Bridge ( Puente Colorao ). It\\'s an iron bridge which was built in 1912 and is located on PR-155 in barrio Morovis Norte .\\n Cuevas Las Cabachuelas (Cabachuelas Caves) is a cave system in Puerto Rico which opened for tourism in 2019. It is located between the municipalities of Morovis and Ciales, Puerto Rico  in the Cabachuelas Natural Reserve, established in 2012  and is of cultural, archaeological, hydrological and geomorphological importance to Puerto Rico.  Guided tours are offered by the Diógenes Colón Gómez Cultural Center in Morovis, by reservation only.   \\n\nLa Patria Bakery, home of the Pan de La Patita Echa\\' , is a bakery established in 1862 in Morovis, that uses a brick oven for making bread. The bread has a curious name and look, resembling crossed legs.   \\n\nThe Julia M. Cheverez Electronic Library is located in the main square in Morovis barrio-pueblo also referred to as the pueblo .  \\n\nEach barrio had a mural painted by a group of local artists and ValorArte and the mural images depict values such as honor, peace, responsibility, leadership and culture.    \\n\nCasa Bavaria restaurant located in the central mountain range ( Cordillera Central ) in Morovis, has become a gathering place for Puerto Rico\\'s German community and was visited in 2009 by President Bill Clinton .   \\n\nCulture\nMorovis celebrates its patron saint festival in July.

The bridge collapse in Morovis\\' San Lorenzo barrio was one of the challenges faced by Maldonado.  Maldonado was reelected in 2020.  \\n\nTransportation\nThere are 15 bridges in Morovis.  Major routes that go through Morovis include PR-137 , PR-145 , PR-155 , PR-159 , and PR-160 .\\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag of Morovis is divided vertically in two equal parts. The immediate one to the mast is yellow and has the eagle of the coat of arms, in this case with the head facing left, toward the flagpole. The other half is divided in seven vertical stripes of equal width, four red ones alternated with three yellow ones.  \\n\nThe coat of arms of the Municipality of Morovis is formed by an eagle in the left partition, which symbolizes Saint John the Evangelist and sings in honor of the founder of the town, Don Juan Evangelista Rivera. The five cuatros observable in the right partition symbolize the fact that the town of Morovis is the main center of production of such typical Puerto Rican musical instruments. The shield in the center represents the Order of the Carmelite Nuns, and symbolizes as well the Our Lady of the Carmen, matron of the town. The left half is a field of yellow color (yellow for gold) in which resides a saber (black) eagle, beak and claws in red, its head enclosed with a halo.  \\n\nNotable moroveños\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

The town was founded in the neighborhood of the same name, on a land donated by Doña Manuela Rivera and Don Braulio Morales. Morales was named \"Captain Settler\" and at the same time was appointed mayor of the town in development.

The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds-eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the local community.   \\n\nNotable people\nBooks about Naranjito\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nOrocovis, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nOrocovis (from the Taino chief Orocobix ) is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the center of the island. Founded by Juan Rivera de Santiago in 1825. Orocovis is spread over 17 barrios. It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . It\\'s located north of Villalba and Coamo ; south of Morovis and Corozal ; southeast of Ciales ; east of Jayuya ; and west of Barranquitas \\n\nHistory\nSince before the Spanish colonization in the 16th century , the Taíno were already established in the region. They were led by the cacique Orocobix and his tribe known as the Jatibonicu . After Spaniards settled in the island, the region was part of the south of Manatí and the north region of Coamo. By 1823 Orocovis was a barrio of Barranquitas while Morovis (previously part of Manatí) had a barrio called Barros .  Both Orocovis and Barros were eventually united to establish a new town.\\n\nIn early 1825, Juan Rivera de Santiago sought and obtained legal power by the neighbors of the region to request the Governor authorization to found a municipality in the Barros area, where they had bought 14 acres of land from Eulalia (Olaya) de Rivera Melendez, who donated an additional acre to establish several municipal works. However, due to the distance from bodies of water, the settlement was moved to another place where it is today. On November 10, 1825, Governor Miguel de la Torre granted permission to found the new municipality of Barros.\\n\nIn 1838, the parish of San Juan Bautista de Barros was created and was blessed and inaugurated on October 29 of the same year. However, in 1875, a fire destroyed the church, the King\\'s House, the priest\\'s house and several homes.\\n\nMost of Orocovis nicknames stem from its location in the center of the island. Some of them are: \" Corazón de Puerto Rico \" (Heart of Puerto Rico) and \" Centro Geográfico de Puerto Rico \" (Geographical Center of Puerto Rico). Locals say the center of Puerto Rico is in a barrio called Pellejas , on Road 566 , Km 5.7 in Orocovis. That the center of Puerto Rico is in front of the Catholic church was determined to be false by engineers from the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus . [ citation needed ] \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Barros, as Orocovis was then called, was 14,845.  \\n\nIn 1928, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a resolution to change the name of Barros to Orocovis , to honor the Taíno cacique of the same name, who lived in that region.\\n\nGeography\nThe municipality Orocovis is mountainous with many valleys. Most of the Orocovis terrain runs through the Cordillera Central of the island. Most of the high peaks are in the southern region of the municipality within the limits of the municipality with Villalba and Coamo . The highest peak of the town is Cerro Mogote.  \\n\nThe rivers Toro Negro , Sana Muertos , Orocovis , Matrullas , and Bauta , and the creeks Doña Juana, Palmar and Cacaos are among the water bodies in the town. There are two lakes: El Guineo , a reservoir of the Toro Negro River, and the Matrullas Lake formed by the Bauta River. El Guineo is Puerto Rico\\'s highest lake.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Orocovis is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .   \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Orocovis: Ala de la Piedra, Alturas de Orocovis, Cacao, Sector Parcelas in Botijas 1, Botijas II, Comunidad Miraflores  and La Pica (Luis M. Alfaro) .  \\n\nEnergy consortium\nAn Energy Consortium was signed in late February, 2019 by Villalba , Orocovis, Morovis , Ciales and Barranquitas municipalities. The consortium is the first of its kind for the island. It is intended to have municipalities work together to safeguard and create resilient, and efficient energy networks, with backups for their communities.  \\n\nCulture\nOrocovis is sometimes called \" The Musical Capital of Puerto Rico \" because many major Puerto Rican performers were either born or raised in the town, particularly bandleader Bobby Valentín , folk singer Andrés Jiménez , merengue singer Manny Manuel , salsa legend William \"H. Christ\" Corchado, and the Colón-Zayas family of musicians, which includes Emma (singer, multi-instrumentalist) and Edwin (a cuatro player).\\n\nCelestino Avilés Meléndez (1925-2004), a santero from Orocovis, saved the dying art from his workshop. Santeros are folk artists who create wooden, religious statuettes called Santos .  The folk artists were dispersed around Puerto Rico and were few in number.  Avilés\\' initiative, in 1983, for santeros to meet continues to this day with the Encuentro Nacional de Santeros taking place in Orocovis, the third week in December annually. Also, Avilés\\' establishing the Museo Orocoveño Familia Avilés Inc. in 1982, a museum for santeros art, revived the culture and art of santeros and santos and by 2019, there were more than 300 santeros making santos in Puerto Rico.  \\n\n\"El Monstruo\" at Toro Verde Nature Adventure Park in Orocovis came in third for longest zip line in the world in 2018, at 2530 m (8,300 ft).  \\n\nOrocovis celebrates its patron saint festival in June. The Fiestas Patronales de San Juan Bautista is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.    \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Orocovis include:\\n\nEconomy\nCattle, coffee, fruits, tobacco, and wheat. A young business growing hydroponics lettuce was in negotiations to be a supplier for Walmart in 2019.  \\n\nSeveral small nutritional product industries.\\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2000 census, Orocovis has a population of 23,844 with a population density is 378.4 people per square mile (145.5/km 2 ). Although there was a decline in the population during the 1980s, it has steadily increased during the last decades.\\n\nStatistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 81.4% of Orocoveños have Spanish or White origin, 4.1% are black , 0.4% are Amerindian etc.\\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years.

Roads #137 and #155 lead from the north, while roads #138 and #155 lead from the south. Orocovis lies at about an hour and a half from San Juan , the capital of Puerto Rico.\\n\nThere are 17 bridges in Orocovis.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe Flag of Orocovis is formed by five vertical stripes: Two green stripes at the ends, representing the territories of Aibonito and Barranquitas ; and a blue one in the center representing the regional domain of the cacique Orocobix prior to the Spanish colonization. These stripes are divided by two narrower white stripes, representing the territories granted by Barranquitas and Morovis to form the municipality in 1825.  \\n\nOver the blue portion there\\'s an oval with a Sun . The Sun has seventeen rays that represent the different regions of the town. The Sun, being the center of the Solar System , represents Orocovis as the center of the island of Puerto Rico .  \\n\nThe oval is symbol of the letter \" O \", initial of the name of the town. In each quadrant appear representative elements of the town. In the left superior quadrant a Taíno Indian bust, symbol of the great \"Chief Orocobix\" and the Indian heritage of the town, silhouetted in gold on a silver-plated background. The Indian bust faces to the star or sun that appears in the superior right quadrant, which is in gold on a blue background and represents the territorial municipality with its seventeen rays or demarcations. In the inferior right quadrant, a plantain plant is observed representing the agriculture , silhouetted in gold on a silver-plated background. A bridge also silhouetted in gold on a blue background, above the river appears in the left inferior quadrant.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

It is spread over 15 barrios and Patillas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the Guayama Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nEuropeans had settled the area as early as 1760. There was, however, no permanent settlement until the town was officially founded in 1811. In 1841 a fire in Patillas killed a great many people.  \\n\nPatillas is located along the southeastern coast of the main island of Puerto Rico. There was an establishment of a sugar cane mill which took advantage of the agricultural potential the coastal valley provided. As this establishment provided a good source of income for the neighbors it also was the main reason for the town\\'s foundation in 1811. Doña Adelina Cintrón, owner of \"La Finca Patillas\", donated almost 8 acres (32,000 m 2 ) of land for the foundation. Most of the neighbors then relocated to the west side of the proposed site called Cacao Bajo .\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Patillas was 11,163.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico.  In Patillas, power was out and 341 homes were completely destroyed.

There is also the Patillas Reservoir called Lago Patillas which was built in 1914. The Patillas and Marín Rivers flow into the reservoir which is also used for fishing.\\n\nEconomy\nIn 2021 the Leader of the Association of Plantain Producers in Puerto Rico indicated the town was one of the main areas of production of plantains .  \\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2000 census, Patillas had a population of 20,152 with a population density is 426.0 people per square mile (163.9/km 2 ). There was a decline in the population during the 1960s and the 1990s and most recently in the 2010 and 2020 census.\\n\nPuerto Rico is primarily made up of a mix of ancestors from Indigenous , European or African descent. Statistics from the 2000 census shows that 67.7% of Patillenses self-identify as European or white origin; only 12.3% self-identify as Afro Puerto Rican and 0.5% self-identify as Amerindian .\\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Patillas is administered by a mayor.

These rectangles are separated by a golden cross symbolizing the fidelity to the town\\'s religious patron \"El Santo Cristo de la Salud\". Superimposed in the middle of the golden cross is an emerald , thus the nickname \"La Esmeralda del Sur\".  \\n\nThe art design of the flag was a creation of Pedro de Pedro in 1977. Each symbol on the flag was defined by Pedro J. Rivera Arbolay. The legal assessor was the attorney Roberto Beascochea Lota.  \\n\nThe coat of arms features a crow with a piece of bread in its beak , which represents the bird that saved the life to San Benito Abad, patron of the town, from being poisoned with a piece of bread. The castle with three windows symbolizes the captivity of Santa Barbara, matron of Patillas in the first years of the foundation and the devotion to the Holy Trinity . The cross represents Santo Cristo de la Salud. The two crossed machetes underneath the cross represent the peasants \\' struggle in the sugar cane plantations and the origins of economic development . The three towers in the superior part mean that Patillas is categorized as a town. The watermelon leaf, fruit that abounded in the west of Patillas, is the reason for the name of the town. The motto \"Ora et Labora\", means \"Pray and Work\"; motto of the religious order of San Benito Abad.  \\n\nThe name Patillas is originally an indigenous name for a native type of watermelon . The large abundance of this fruit in the area, along with the land donation from the original owner, lead to the town\\'s name.\\n\nAlthough it is both a mountain town and a beach town, Patillas is known as the \"Emerald of the South\" for its majestic green color that stands out from the mountains with the reflection of the sun. This town has natural resources that invite the disconnection of the bustle of the city, such as beaches, forests, and the Patillas Lake. The coastal waters and the lake are used by many for recreational fishing.\\n\nBy Andrés Plaud Soto\\n\n\"Patillenses, \\xc2 1Veis la luz, de la antorcha y su esplendor, \\nque ilumina en noble gesta de amor... la ruta que recorrió, \\nel que por ti ayer luchó, en las lides de los campos del honor!\\n\nNo olvidéis otras proezas en las Artes del Saber, \\nproducto de otros hermanos, que este pueblo vio nacer. \\nSus conquistas celebramos con solemne admiración: \\n\\xc2 1Hosana mis compueblanos...

        "page_content": "Contents\nPeñuelas, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nPeñuelas  is a town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the Peñuelas Valley on the southern coast of the island, south of Adjuntas , east of Guayanilla , west of Ponce and north of the Caribbean Sea . Peñuelas is spread over 12 barrios and Peñuelas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the Yauco Metropolitan Statistical Area . Peñuelas is known as \" La Capital del Güiro \" (The Güiro Capital) and \" El Valle de los Flamboyanes \" (The Valley of the Royal Poinciana trees ). In 2020, Peñuelas had a population of 20,399.\\n\nHistory\nIn 1754, a group of workers had settled over the Bay of Tallaboa . Later gradually retreated deeper into the valley, heading tobarrios the most fertile land which would then be part of the town of Peñuelas. For the year 1788, approximately 80 families inhabiting the valley, which focused mainly on agriculture and livestock.\\nPeñuelas Township was founded August 25, 1793 by Diego de Alvarado.  \\n\nBy 1874, the town had been developed and had a population of 9,206, according to a census of that year. The town had four main roads, some streets, a brick church and the town hall, which also served as a prison, barracks and a cemetery.\\n\nOn March 1, 1902 the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a law to consolidate certain municipal districts, so Peñuelas neighborhoods were attached to the municipality of Ponce . In 1905, the same Assembly repealed the law and Peñuelas became once again a municipality.\\n\nThe first incident of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolt of 1950 occurred during the early hours of October 29, 1950 in Peñuelas when the insular police of that town surrounded the house of the mother of Melitón Muñiz Santos, the president of the Peñuelas chapter of the Nationalist Party in the barrio Macaná, under the pretext that he was storing weapons for the Nationalist Revolt. Without warning, the police fired upon the Nationalists in the house and a firefight between both factions ensued, which resulted in the death of two Nationalists and the wounding of six police officers.  Nationalists Melitón Muñiz Santos, Roberto Jaume Rodríguez, Estanislao Lugo Santiago, Marcelino Turell, William Gutiérrez and Marcelino Berríos were arrested and accused of participating in an ambush against the local insular police.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Peñuelas, an estimated 1,500 homes were completely destroyed and 500 were partially destroyed.  With its winds and rainfall, the hurricane triggered numerous landslides in northern Peñuelas.   \\n\nGeography\nPeñuelas is located on the southern coast, slightly west of the center.  \\n\nRivers near Peñuelas include:\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Peñuelas is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nWithin barrios are communities: For example, the Santo Domingo comunidad (\\'community\\') in Santo Domingo barrio and the Tallaboa community in the barrio of Encarnación .\\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Peñuelas: Maldonado neighborhood (Los Chinos), Santo Domingo barrio, Comunidad Caracoles, and Comunidad La Moca in Tallaboa Alta.  \\n\nDemographics\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Peñuelas was 12,129.\\n\nTourism\nThere are 15 beaches in Peñuelas.  \\nThe main attractions in Peñuelas are:\\n\nEconomy\nManufacturing, refinery.\\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico, Peñuelas is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Gregory Gonsález Souchet, from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Gonsález was elected at a special election in 2018 after the incumbent Walter Torres Maldonado stepped down from the mayoral position.\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Ramón Ruiz and Martín Vargas Morales , from the Popular Democratic Party , were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nIt has a rectangular bottom in canary yellow and stands for the sun, symbol of the physical life. In the center it has a purple or violet cross: symbol of Christianity and its ecclesiastical order; it represents the spiritual life. The cross purple extends to all the points of the yellow rectangle.  \\n\nThe adornment above the shield, a stone wall, represents the perpetuity. The cross represents Santo Cristo de la Salud that \"stopped the sea from flooding Peñuelas\". The purple arm represents the priesthood and the town of Peñuelas. The canary yellow represents the sun. The blue and white symbolize the choppy sea and the regal ensign represents the faith in Christianity, \" In God We Trust \".  \\n\nCulture\nPeñuelas celebrates its patron saint festival in late October / early November. The Fiestas Patronales de San Jose is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Peñuelas include:  \\n\nSports\nPeñuelas AA Amateur Baseball team is called Los Petroleros de Peñuelas (The Peñuelas\\' Oilers.)

        "page_content": "Contents\nPonce, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nPonce  is a city and a municipality on the southern coast of Puerto Rico .  The most populated city outside the San Juan metropolitan area, was founded on August 12, 1692 [ note 1 ]     and is named after Juan Ponce de León y Loayza ,  the great-grandson of Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León . [ note 2 ] Ponce is often referred to as La Perla del Sur (The Pearl of the South), La Ciudad Señorial [ b ] (The Manorial City [ c ] ), and La Ciudad de las Quenepas ( Genip City). \\n\nThe city serves as the governmental seat of the autonomous municipality as well as the regional hub for various Government of Puerto Rico entities, such as the Judiciary of Puerto Rico . It is also the regional center for various U.S. Federal Government agencies. Ponce is a principal city of both the Ponce Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Ponce-Yauco-Coamo Combined Statistical Area .\\n\nThe municipality of Ponce , officially the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce , is located in the southern coastal plain region of the island, south of Adjuntas , Utuado , and Jayuya ; east of Peñuelas ; west of Juana Díaz ; and bordered on the south by the Caribbean Sea . The municipality has 31 barrios , including 19 outside the city\\'s urban area and 12 in the urban area of the city. It is the second largest in Puerto Rico by land area, and it was the first in Puerto Rico to obtain its autonomy , becoming the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce in 1992.\\n\nThe historic Ponce Pueblo district, located in the downtown area of the city, is composed by several of the downtown barrios , and is located approximately three miles (4.8 km) inland from the Caribbean coast. The historic district is characterized for its Neoclásico Isabelino and Ponce Creole architectures .   \\n\nHistory\nThe region of what is now Ponce belonged to the Taíno Guaynia region, which stretched along the southern coast of Puerto Rico.  Agüeybaná , a cacique who led the region, was among those who greeted Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León when he came to the island in 1508. Archaeological findings have identified four sites within the municipality of Ponce with archaeological significance: Canas , Tibes , Caracoles , and El Bronce .  \\n\nDuring the first years of the colonization , Spanish families started settling around the Jacaguas River , in the south of the island.  For security reasons,  these families moved to the banks of the Rio Portugués , then called Baramaya.   Starting around 1646 the whole area from the Rio Portugués to the Bay of Guayanilla was called Ponce.   In 1670, a small chapel was raised in the middle of the small settlement and dedicated in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe .  Among its earliest settlers were Juan Ponce de León y Loayza , and the Portuguese Don Pedro Rodríguez de Guzmán, from nearby San Germán .  \\n\nOn September 17, 1692, the King of Spain Carlos II issued a Cédula Real (Royal Permit) converting the chapel into a parish, and in so doing officially recognizing the small settlement as a hamlet.  It is believed that Juan Ponce de León y Loayza, Juan Ponce de León\\'s great-grandson, was instrumental in obtaining the royal permit to formalize the founding of the hamlet .  Captains Enrique Salazar and Miguel del Toro were also instrumental.  The city is named after Juan Ponce de León y Loayza,   the great-grandson of Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León.  \\n\nIn the early 18th century Don Antonio Abad Rodriguez Berrios built a small chapel under the name of San Antonio Abad. The area would later receive the name of San Antón , a historically important part of modern Ponce.  In 1712 the village was chartered as El Poblado de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Ponce (The Village of Our Lady of Guadalupe of Ponce).  \\n\nIn the early 19th century, Ponce continued to be one of dozens of hamlets that dotted the Island. Its inhabitants survived by subsistence agriculture , cattle raising , and maritime contraband with foreigners. Mayor José Benítez categorized the jurisdiction into cotos , hatos , criaderos , monterías , and terrenos realengos .  Cotos were lands awarded to residents as reward for their services to the king. They were developed into estancias or lands apt to be cultivated for agricultural use. Hatos were lands not granted to anyone in particular, but available for communal use where cattle could roam at will. Monterías were hilly areas located next to hatos were cattle could be reigned in or gathered together with the help of trained dogs. Criaderos were lands were cows could be herded for milk production. Goats, sheep, pigs, asses, and mares were also herded in criaderos . Terrenos realengos were lands that belonged to the state (to the king).   \\n\nHowever, in the 1820s, three events dramatically changed the size of the town. The first of these events was the arrival of a significant number of white Francophones , fleeing the Haitian Revolution of 1791-1804.  The effect of this mass migration was not felt significantly until the 1820s. These French Creole entrepreneurs were attracted to the area because of its large flatlands, and they came with enough capital, slaves , and commercial connections to stimulate Ponce\\'s sugarcane production and sales.  \\n\nSecondly, landlords and merchants migrated from various Latin American countries. They had migrated for better conditions, as they were leaving economic decline following the revolutions and disruption of societies as nations gained independence from Spain in the 1810s-1820s.  \\n\nThird, the Spanish Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 attracted numerous European immigrants to Puerto Rico. It encouraged any citizen of a country politically friendly to Spain to settle in Puerto Rico as long as they converted to the Catholic faith and agreed to work in the agricultural business. With such mass migrations, not only the size of the town was changed, but the character of its population was changed as well. Europeans, including many Protestants , immigrated from a variety of nations.  On July 29, 1848, and as a result of this explosive growth, the Ponce hamlet was declared a villa (village) by Queen Isabella II ,   and in 1877 the village obtained its city charter.   \\n\nSome of these immigrants made considerable fortunes in coffee , corn and sugarcane harvesting, rum production,  banking and finance , the importing of industrial machinery, iron foundries and other enterprises. At the time of the American invasion of the Island in 1898, Ponce was a thriving city,  boasting the Island\\'s main financial center,  the Island\\'s first communications link to another country,  the best capitalized financial institutions, and even its own currency.  It had consular offices for England, Germany, the Netherlands, and other nations.  \\n\nFollowing trends set in Europe and elsewhere, in 1877, Don Miguel Rosich conceived an exposition for Ponce. This was approved in 1880, and the Ponce Fair was held in the city in 1882. It showed several industrial and agricultural advancements. \\n\n\"It is important to establish a relationship between the European exhibitions that I have mentioned and the Ponce Fair, as the Fair was meant as a showcase of the advancements of the day: Agriculture, Trade, Industry, and the Arts. Just as with the 1878 World\\'s Fair in Paris, the electric grid of the city of Ponce was inaugurated on the first day of the Ponce Fair. In this occasion the Plaza Las Delicias and various other buildings, including the Mercantile Union Building, the Ponce Casino , and some of Ponce\\'s homes were illuminated with the incandescent light bulb for the first time\". \nAt the time of the U.S. invasion and occupation of Puerto Rico in 1898 during the Spanish-American War , Ponce was the largest city in the island with a population of 22,000. Ponce had the best road in Puerto Rico, running from Ponce to San Juan , which had been built by the Spaniards for military purposes.  The taking of Ponce by American troops \"was a critical turning point in the Puerto Rican campaign. For the first time the Americans held a major port to funnel large numbers of men and quantities of war material into the island.\" Ponce also had underwater telegraph cable connections with Jamaica and the West Indies , putting the U.S. forces on the island in direct communication with Washington, D.C. , for the first time since the beginning of the campaign.  Just prior to the United States occupation of the island, Ponce was a flourishing and dynamic city with a significant number of public facilities, a large number of industries and commercial firms, and a great number of exquisite residences that reflected the high standing of its bourgeoisie.  \\n\nOn July 27, American troops, aboard the Cincinnati , Dixie , Wasp , and Gloucester , disembarked at Playa de Ponce.  General Nelson Miles arrived the next day with reinforcements from Guánica and took possession of the city. There were some minor skirmishes in the city, but no major battle was fought. Three men were killed and 13 wounded on the Spanish side, while the Americans suffered four wounded. The American flag was raised in the town center that same day and most of the Spanish troops retreated into the surrounding mountains. The U.S. Army then established its headquarters in Ponce.  \\n\nAfter the U.S. invasion , the Americans chose to centralize the administration of the island in San Juan ,  the capital, neglecting the south and thus starting a period of socio- economic stagnation for Ponce.  This was worsened by several factors:\\n\nAt least one author has also blamed the stagnation on \"the strife between the U.S. and the local Nationalist Party .\"  \\n\nThe 20th century financial stagnation prompted residents to initiate measures to attract economic activity back into the city. Also, a solid manufacturing industry surged that still remains. Examples of this are the Ponce Cement , Puerto Rico Iron Works , Vassallo Industries , and Destilería Serrallés . El Dia was also founded in Ponce in 1911.\\n\nOn March 21, 1937, a peaceful march was organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party to celebrate the 64th anniversary of the abolition of slavery and protest the incarceration of their leader, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos , in a federal prison on charges of sedition .  \\n\nThe march turned into a bloody event when the Insular Police, a force somewhat resembling the National Guard of the typical U.S. state and which answered to U.S.-appointed governor Blanton Winship , opened fire on\\nunarmed and defenseless members of the Cadets of the Republic and bystanders.   \\n\nWhen the shooting stopped, nineteen civilians had been killed or mortally wounded.  Over two hundred others were badly wounded.  Many were shot in their backs while running away, including a seven-year-old girl named Georgina Maldonado who was \"killed through the back while running to a nearby church.\"   \\n\nThe US commissioned an independent investigation headed by Arthur Garfield Hays, general counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union , together with prominent citizens of Puerto Rico. The members concluded in their report that the event was a massacre, with the police acting as a mob. They harshly criticized Winship\\'s actions as governor and said he had numerous abuses of civil rights.  The event has since been known as the Ponce massacre .  It was the largest massacre in Puerto Rican history.  As a result of this report and other charges against Winship, he was dismissed from his position in 1937 and replaced as governor.  \\n\nThe history of this event can be viewed at the Ponce Massacre Museum on Marina Street. An open-air park in the city, the Pedro Albizu Campos Park , is dedicated to the memory of the president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. As a result of this event, Ponce has been identified as \"the birthplace of Puerto Rican national identity.\"  Ponce history in general is expressed at the Ponce History Museum , on the block bordered by Isabel, Mayor, Cristina, and Salud streets in the historic downtown area.\\n\nPonce has continued to be a hub of political activity on the island, and is the founding site of several major political parties. It has also been the birthplace of several important political figures of the island, including Luis A. Ferré and Rafael Hernández Colón , both former governors of Puerto Rico , as well as the childhood town of governor Roberto Sanchez Vilella .\\n\nStatistics taken from the 2010 census show that 82.0% of Ponceños are white and 9.0% are African-American , with Taínos , Asians , people of mixed race and others making up the rest.  At 82.0% vs. 76.2% for the island as a whole, Ponce has the highest concentration of white population of any municipality in Puerto Rico.  However, the US Census Bureau changed the definitions of its racial makeup categories for the 2020 Census  resulting in 19.0% of Ponceños being classified as white and 13.3% as Black/Afro Puerto Rican\\' , 0.3% as Asian , and people of mixed race making up the rest.\\n\nThe 1970s brought significant commercial, industrial and banking changes to Ponce that dramatically altered its financial stability and outlook of the city, the municipality and, to an extent, the entire southern Puerto Rico region. After Luis A. Ferre concluded his term as governor of Puerto Rico on January 1, 1973, he closed the Puerto Rico Iron Works foundry on Avenida Hostos , and transferred the offices of Ponce\\'s island-wide El Dia newspaper that he owned, as well as the headquarters of his Empresas Ferré , to San Juan. In 1976, CORCO \\xe2\\x80\\x94southern Puerto Rico\\'s main source of economic vitality\\xe2\\x80\\x94shut down its industrial operations in Guayanilla leaving thousands of area residents without work; its impact on indirect sources of employment was even greater. Also, the sugar cane industry, also suffered a major downturn. Sugar cane had until 1976 been grown and refined at Ponce\\'s Central Mercedita , but in that year agricultural production of sugar cane was halted in the lands of the municipality of Ponce and adjacent towns. Also, the headquarters of Banco de Ponce and Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño were moved to San Juan. Unemployment of Ponce jumped to 25% as a result of these changes.  \\n\nOn October 7, 1985, Ponce was the scene of a major tragedy, when at least 129 people lost their lives to a mudslide in a sector of Barrio Portugués Urbano  called Mameyes . International help was needed to rescue people and recover corpses. The United States and many other countries, including Mexico, France, and Venezuela , sent economic, human, and machinery relief. The commonwealth government, subsequently, relocated hundreds of people to a new community built on stable\\nground.  In 2005, the National Science and Technology Council\\'s Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the United States reported that the Mameyes landslide held the record for having inflicted \"the greatest loss of life by a single landslide\" up to that year.  \\n\nThe municipality of Ponce became the first in Puerto Rico to obtain its autonomy  on October 27, 1992, under a new law ( The Autonomous Municipalities Act of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  ) enacted by the Puerto Rican legislature. Ponce\\'s mayor for 15 years, Rafael Cordero Santiago (\"Churumba\"), credited for leading the municipal government to that accomplishment, died in office on the morning of January 17, 2004, after suffering three consecutive strokes. Vice-mayor Delis Castillo Rivera de Santiago finished his term. Cordero was succeeded by Francisco Zayas Seijo . In the 2008 general elections María \"Mayita\" Meléndez was elected mayor of the city of Ponce and served three terms.  The current (2021) mayor is Luis Irizarry Pabón who became the first mayoral candidate in the modern history of Ponce to win with more than 60% of votes cast.  \\n\nThe city is also the governmental seat of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce, and the regional hub for various commonwealth entities. For example, it serves as the southern hub for the Judiciary of Puerto Rico.    It is also the regional center for various other commonwealth and federal government agencies.  \\n\nPonce has improved its economy in the last years. In recent years, Ponce has solidified its position as the second most important city of Puerto Rico based on its economic progress and increasing population.  Today, the city of Ponce is the second largest in Puerto Rico outside of the San Juan metropolitan area.  Its nicknames include: La Perla del Sur (The Pearl of the South)  and La Ciudad Señorial (The Noble or Lordly City).  The city is also known as La Ciudad de las Quenepas ( Genip City),   from the abundant amount of this fruit that grows within its borders. The complete history of Ponce can be appreciated at the Museo de la Historia de Ponce , which opened in the city in 1992. It depicts the history of the city from its early settlement days until the end of the 20th century.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Ponce, $1,000 million in damages were the initial estimates. An estimated 3,500 homes were completely or partially destroyed.  The hurricane triggered numerous landslides in Ponce.   \\n\nGeography\nThe Municipality of Ponce sits on the Southern Coastal Plain region of the Puerto Rico, on the shores of the Caribbean Sea. It is bordered by the municipalities of Adjuntas, Utuado, Jayuya, Peñuelas, and Juana Díaz.  \\nPonce is a large municipality, with only Arecibo larger in land area in Puerto Rico.  In terms of physical features, the municipality occupies a roughly rectangular area in south-central portion of the Island of approximately 10 miles (16 km) wide (east-to-west) by 13 miles (21 km) long (north-to-south).  It has a surface area of 116.0 square miles (300 km 2 ).  The main physiographic features of the municipality of Ponce are: (1) the mountainous interior containing the headwaters of the main river systems, (2) an upper plain, (3) a range of predominantly east-west trending limestone hills, (4) a coastal plain, and (5) a coastal flat.  The northern two-thirds of the municipality consists of the mountainous interior, with the southern third divided between hills, coastal plains, and the coastal flat.  \\n\nPonce\\'s municipal territory reaches the central mountain range to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. Geographically speaking, the southern area of the territory is part of the Ponce-Patillas alluvial plain subsector and the southern coastal plain, which were created by the consolidation of the valleys of the southern side of the central mountain range and the Cayey mountain range. The central area of the municipality is part of the semi-arid southern hills. These two regions are classified as being the driest on the island. The northern part of the municipality is considered to be within the rainy western mountains.  Barrio Anón is home to Cerro Maravilla , a peak that at 4,085 feet (1,245 m) is Puerto Rico\\'s fourth highest peak.  \\n\nNineteen barrios  comprise the rural areas of the municipality, and the topology of their lands varies from flatlands to hills to steep mountain slopes. The hilly barrios of the municipality (moving clockwise around the outskirts of the city) are these seven: Quebrada Limón , Marueño , Magueyes , Tibes , Portugués Rural , Machuelo Arriba , and Cerrillos . The barrios of Canas , Coto Laurel , Capitanejo , Sabanetas , Vayas , and Bucaná also surround the outskirts of the city but these are mostly flat. The remaining six other barrios are further away from the city and their topology is rugged mountain terrain. These are (clockwise): Guaraguao , San Patricio , Monte Llano , Maragüez , Anón , and Real . The ruggedness of these barrios is because through these areas of the municipality runs the Central Mountain Range of the Island.  The remaining barrios are part of the urban zone of the city.   There are six barrios in the core urban zone of the municipality named Primero , Segundo , Tercero , Cuarto , Quinto , and Sexto . They are delimetered by streets, rivers, or major highways. For example, Barrio Tercero is bounded in the north by Isabel Street, in the east by the Rio Portugués, in the south by Comercio Street, and the west by Plaza Las Delicias .  Barrio Tercero includes much of what is called the historic district.\\n\nThere is a seismic detector that the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus, has placed in Barrio Cerrillos.  \\n\nElevations include Cerro de Punta at 4,390 feet (1,340 m), the highest in Puerto Rico, located in Barrio Anón in the territory of the municipality of Ponce.   Mount Jayuya, at 4,314 feet (1,315 m) is located on the boundary between Barrio Anón and Barrio Saliente in Jayuya. Cerro Maravilla , at nearly 3,970 feet (1,210 m) above sea level, is located to the east of Barrio Anón. There are many other mountains at lower elevations in the municipality, such as the Montes Llanos ridge and Mount Diablo, at 2,231 feet (680 m) and Mount Marueño, at 2,100 feet (640 m), and Pinto Peak, among others. Part of the Toro Negro Forest is located in Barrio Anón. Coastal promontories include Cuchara, Peñoncillo, Carnero, and Cabullón points.  Fifty-six percent of the municipality consists of slopes 10 degrees or greater.  \\n\nThe 14 rivers comprising the hydrographic system of Ponce are Matilde , Inabón , Bucaná , Jacaguas , Portugués , Cañas , Pastillo , Cerrillos , Chiquito , Bayagan , Blanco , Prieto , Anón and San Patricio  The Jacaguas River runs for a brief stretch on the southeast area of the municipality. The Inabón River springs from Anón ward and runs through the municipality for some 18 mi (29.0 km); the tributaries of the Inabón are the Anón and Guayo rivers and the Emajagua Brook. The Bucaná River springs from Machuelo Arriba ward and runs for 18.5 mi (29.8 km) into the Caribbean Sea. The tributaries of the Bucaná are the San Patricio, Bayagán , and Prieto Rivers and Ausubo brook. The Portugués River springs from the ward of that name in Adjuntas, and runs for 17.3 mi (27.8 km) into the Caribbean sea at Ponce Playa ward. The Matilde River, also known as the Pastillo River, runs for 12 mi (19 km); its tributaries are the Cañas River and the Limón and del Agua brooks. Lakes in Ponce include Bronce and Ponceña as well as lakes bearing numbers: Uno, Dos, Tres, and Cinco; and the Salinas Lagoon, which is considered a restricted lagoon.  Other water bodies are the springs at Quintana and the La Guancha and El Tuque beaches.  There is also a beach at Caja de Muertos Island . Lake Cerrillos is located within the limits of the municipality,  as will be the future lake resulting from the Portugués Dam . The Cerrillos State Forest is also located in the municipality of Ponce.\\n\nCoastal geographic features in Ponce include Bahía de Ponce , Caleta de Cabullones (Cabullones Cove), and five cays: Jueyes , Ratones ,  Cardona , Gatas , and Isla del Frio .  Caja de Muertos Island and Morrillito islet are located at the boundary between Ponce and Juana Díaz. There is a mangrove covering an area of approximately 100 acres (40 ha) at Cabullón promontory and Isla del Frio. The Salinas Lagoon, part of Reserva Natural Punta Cucharas , has a mangrove that expands about 37 acres (15 ha). The lagoon itself consists of 698 cuerdas (678 acres; 274 ha).  The Rita cave is located in Barrio Cerrillos.  \\n\nPonce features a tropical savanna climate ( Koppen Aw/As ). Ponce has summer highs averaging 92 °F (33 °C)  and winter highs, 87 °F (31 °C).  It has lows averaging 67 °F (19 °C) in the winter  and 74 °F (23 °C) in the summer.  It has a record high of 100 °F (38 °C), which occurred on 21 August 2003,  and a record low of 51 °F (11 °C) which occurred on 28 February 2004, tying the record low of 51 °F (11 °C) from 25 January 1993.  The mean annual temperature in the municipality is 79 °F (26 °C).  \\n\nCityscape\nDuring the 19th century, the city was witness to a flourishing architectural development, including the birth of a new architectural style later dubbed Ponce Creole . Architects like Francisco Valls, Manuel Víctor Domenech , Eduardo Salich, Blas Silva Boucher , Agustín Camilo González, Alfredo Wiechers, Francisco Porrata Doria and Francisco Gardón Vega used a mixture of Art Nouveau and neoclassic styles to give the city a unique look. This can be seen in the various structures located in the center of the city like the Teatro La Perla . To showcase its rich architectural heritage, the city has opened the Museum of Puerto Rican Architecture at the Wiechers-Villaronga residence.   \\n\nMany of the city\\'s features (from house fa\\xc3 7ades to chamfered street corners) are modeled on Barcelona \\'s architecture, given the city\\'s strong Catalan heritage. In 2020, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named the Ponce Historic Zone as one of America\\'s most endangered historic places.  \\n\nWith 31 barrios , Ponce is Puerto Rico\\'s municipality with the largest number of barrios.     Ponce\\'s barrios consist of 12 located in the urban area of the city plus 19 outside the urban zone.   Of these nineteen, seven were considered suburban in 1999. The suburban barrios were: Canas , Magueyes , Portugués , Machuelo Arriba , Sabanetas , Coto Laurel , and Cerrillos .  A 2000 report by the U.S. Census Bureau provides detailed demographics statistics for each of Ponce\\'s barrios.  \\n\nThe 2000 Census showed that Montes Llanos is the least populated barrio in the municipality. Thanks to its larger area, barrio Canas was by far the most populated ward of the municipality.  At 68 persons per square mile, San Patricio was the least populated, while Cuarto was the most densely populated at 18,819 persons per square mile.\\n\nPonce has nine barrios that border neighboring municipalities. These are Canas , Quebrada Limón , Marueño , Guaraguao , San Patricio , Anón , Real , Coto Laurel , and Capitanejo . Canas and Capitanejo are also coastal barrios, and together with three others ( Playa , Bucaná , and Vayas ) make up the municipality\\'s five coastal barrios.\\n\nThere are also five barrios within the city limits ( Canas Urbano , Machuelo Abajo , Magueyes Urbano , Portugués Urbano , and San Antón ) that in addition to the original six city core barrios \\xe2\\x80\\x94 named Primero , Segundo , Tercero , Cuarto , Quinto , and Sexto \\xe2\\x80\\x94 make up the 11 urban zone barrios of the municipality. The historic zone of the city is within these original six core city barrios. These eleven barrios composed what is known as the urban zone of the municipality.\\n\nThe remaining eight barrios ( Magueyes , Tibes , Montes Llanos , Maragüez , Portugués , Machuelo Arriba , Cerrillos , Sabanetas ) are located in the interior of the municipality. These last eight are outside the city limits and are neither coastal nor bordering barrios.  \\n\nA summary of all the barrios of the municipality, their population, population density, and land and water areas as given by the U.S. Census Bureau is as follows:    \\n\nTourism\nDue to its historical importance throughout the years, Ponce features many points of interest for visiting tourists.  The downtown area contains the bulk of Ponce\\'s tourist attractions.  Tourism has seen significant growth in recent years. In 2007, over 6,000 tourists visited the city via cruise ships.  Passenger movement at the Mercedita Airport in FY 2008 was 278,911, a 1,228% increase over fiscal year 2003 and the highest of all the regional airports for that 5-year period.  Though not all of these were tourists, it represents a volume larger than the population of the city itself.\\n\nTo support a growing tourist industry, around the 1970s, and starting with the Ponce Holiday Inn , several hotels have been built. Newer lodging additions include the Ponce Hilton Golf & Casino Resort, home to the new Costa Caribe Golf & Country Club, featuring a 27-hole PGA championship golf course . The Hotel Meliá has operated in the city continuously since the early 20th century. It has also been studied that the Intercontinental Hotel , which opened in February 1960 and closed in 1975, could be refurbished and re-opened atop the hill near Cruceta del Vigía as the \"Magna Vista Resort\".  The Ponce Ramada also opened in 2009, and other hotel projects in the works include the Four Points by Sheraton , and Marriott Courtyard, among others.  In 2013, the downtown Ponce Ramada Hotel added a casino to its 70-room structure.   Ponce is part of the Government of Puerto Rico\\'s Porta Caribe tourist region.\\n\nIn recent years an intensive $440 million   revitalization project called \" Ponce en Marcha \"  (\"Ponce on the Move\") has increased the city\\'s historic area from 260 to 1,046 buildings.  The Ponce en Marcha [ d ] project was conceived in 1985 by then governor Rafael Hernández Colón during his second term in La Fortaleza and Ponce mayor Jose Dapena Thompson .   The plan was approved by the Ponce Municipal Legislature on January 14, 2003. It was signed by Governor Sila Calderon via Executive Order on December 28, 2003, and went into effect on January 12, 2004. The plan incorporates one billion dollars in spending during the period of 2004 through 2012.  A significant number of buildings in Ponce are listed in the National Register of Historic Places .  The nonprofit Project for Public Places  listed the historic downtown Ponce city center as one of the 60 of the World\\'s Great Places , for its \"graciously preserved showcase of Caribbean culture\".  The revitalized historic area of the city goes by various names, including \"Ponce Centro\" (Ponce Center),  \"Historic Ponce\",  and \"Historic District.\"  The name \"Ponce en Marcha\" comes from the revitalization plan of Zona Atocha in Madrid called Atocha en Marcha .  \\n\nThe city has been christened as Museum City for its many quality museums.   All museums in Ponce are under municipal government administration. On 15 September 2004, the last four museums not under local control were transferred from the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture to the Ponce Municipal Government by act of the Puerto Rico Legislature.  However, these four museums ( Casa Armstrong Poventud , Casa Wiechers-Villaronga , Museo de la Música Puertorriqueña , and Casa de la Masacre ) continue to be controlled by the ICP.   Downtown Ponce in particular features several museums and landmarks.  \\n\nPlaza Las Delicias , the town\\'s main square, features a prominent fountain (namely, the \"Lions Fountain\"), the Ponce Cathedral , and Parque de Bombas , an old fire house, now a museum, that stands as an iconic symbol of the city and a tribute to the bravery of its firefighters. This plaza is also a usual gathering place for \"ponceños\". Other buildings around Ponce\\'s main plaza include the Casa Alcaldía ( Ponce City Hall ), the oldest colonial building in the city, dating to the 1840s, and the Armstrong-Poventud Residence , an example of the neoclassical architectural heritage of the island.\\n\nJust north of downtown Ponce lies the Castillo Serrallés and the Cruceta del Vigía , a 100-foot (30 m) observation tower which overlooks the city. The Serralles castle is reported to receive nearly 100,000 visitors every year.  The hill on which the Cruceta is located was originally used by scouts to scan for incoming mercantile ships as well as invading ones. The invasion of American troops in 1898 was first spotted from there.\\n\nPonce is home to Puerto Rico\\'s oldest cemetery; in fact, it is the oldest cemetery in the Antilles . In the city outskirts, the Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center was discovered in 1975 after hurricane rains uncovered pottery .  The center is the site of the oldest cemetery uncovered up to date in the Antilles. With some 200 skeletons unearthed from the year 300 AD, it is considered the largest and the most important archaeological finding in the West Indies.   Two other cemeteries in Ponce worth noting are the Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro and the Cementerio Catolico San Vicente de Paul , both of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places . The Cementerio Catolico San Vicente de Paul has the most eye-catching burial constructions of any cemetery for the wealthiest families, both local and foreign-born, of southern Puerto Rico.  \\n\nAlso in the city outskirts is Hacienda Buena Vista , an estate built in 1833 originally to grow fruits. It was converted into a coffee plantation and gristmill in 1845. It remained in operation until 1937, then fell into disrepair, but was restored by the government\\'s Fideicomiso de Conservación de Puerto Rico . All the machinery works (the metal parts) are original, operated by water channeled from the 360m Vives waterfall; there is a hydraulic turbine which makes the corn mill work.\\n\nPaseo Tablado La Guancha is located in the town\\'s sea shore. It features kiosks with food and beverages, an open-space stage for activities, and a marina called Club Náutico de Ponce . From the observation tower on the boardwalk, Cardona Island Light can be seen. A 45-minute boat ride is also available to Isla de Caja de Muertos (Coffin Island), a small island with several beaches and an 1887 lighthouse .\\n\nAs of 2008 [update] , the city had also engaged in the development of a convention center with a capacity for 3,000 people. It is also to include two major hotels, apartment buildings and recreational facilities.  Puerto Rico Route 143 ( PR-143 ), known as the Panoramic Route , runs edging near the municipality\\'s northern border.  \\n\nCulture\nThe city is home to a long list of cultural assets including libraries, museums, galleries, and parks, hundreds of buildings of historical value including schools, residences, bridges, and estates, and frequent activities such as festivals and carnivals. The municipality invests close to half a million dollars in promoting its cultural assets.  It established its first library in 1894  and, as of 2007 [update] had a new central library  with seven other branches scattered throughout the municipality.  \\n\nA number of cultural events take place during the year, most prominently:   \\n\nThe city values its cultural traditions as evidenced by the revitalization project Ponce en Marcha. It is deeply rooted in its traditional cultural, artistic, and musical heritage. The love for art and architecture, for example, can be appreciated at its museums of art, music, and architecture.\\n\n\"Over the last century or so, the north [i.e., San Juan] willingly accepted the influence of western culture with its tendency toward large sprawling metropolises, and the displacement of old values and attitudes. Ponce, on the other hand, has been content to retain its old traditions and culture . Ponce is not concerned about losing its long standing position as the second largest city in population after San Juan. On the contrary, she prefers to maintain her current size, and stick to its old traditions and culture.\"  \nSome argue that the Ponceño culture is different from the rest of the Island: \\n\n\"Ponceños have always been a breed apart from other Puerto Ricans. Their insularity and haughtiness are legendary, and some Puerto Ricans claim that even the dialect in Ponce is slightly different from that spoken in the rest of the Island. They are also racially different: you\\'ll see more people of African descent in Ponce than anywhere else in the Island except Loiza .\" \nOthers claim that Ponceños exhibit considerable more civic pride than do residents of other locales.  Luis Muñoz Rivera , the most important statesman in the Island at the close of the 19th century, referred to Ponce as \"the most Puerto Rican city of Puerto Rico.\"  [ e ] \\n\nArtistic development also flourished during this period. The surging of popular rhythms like Bomba and Plena took place in the south region of the island, mainly in Ponce. Barrio San Antón is known as one of the birthplaces of the rhythm. Every July, Ponce celebrates an annual festival of Bomba and Plena, which includes various musicians and parades.\\n\nImmigrants from Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and England came to Ponce to develop an international city that still maintains rich Taíno and African heritage. The African personality, belief, and music add flavor and colorful rhythm to Ponce\\'s culture. Part of this are the influences of the Bomba and Plena rhythms. These are a combination and Caribbean and African music.  \\n\nPonce has also been the birthplace of several singers and musicians. From opera singers like Antonio Paoli , who lived in the early 20th century, to contemporary singers like Ednita Nazario . Also, Salsa singers like Héctor Lavoe , Cheo Feliciano , and Ismael Quintana also come from the city.\\n\nDating back to 1858, Ponce\\'s Carnival is the oldest in Puerto Rico, and acquired an international flavor for its 150th anniversary.  It is one of the oldest carnivals celebrated in the Western Hemisphere. It features various parades with masked characters representative of good and evil.\\n\nThe Museum of Puerto Rican Music , located at the Serrallés-Nevárez family residence in downtown Ponce, illustrates music history on the Island, most of which had its origin and development in Ponce.  \\n\nNo discussion of music in Ponce would be complete without rendering honor to the great performances of King of Tenors Antonio Paoli and danza master Juan Morel Campos , both from Ponce. Today, there is a statue of Juan Morel Campos that adorns the Plaza Las Delicias city square, and the home where Paoli was born and raised functions as the Puerto Rico Center for Folkloric Research, a research center for Puerto Rican culture.\\n\nA municipal band presents concerts every Sunday evening, and a Youth Symphony Orchestra also performs.  \\n\nPonce\\'s love for the arts dates back to at least 1864 when the Teatro La Perla was built. Ponce is also the birthplace of artists like Miguel Pou , Horacio Castaing, and several others in the fields of painting , sculpture , and others. The City is one of only seven cities in the Western Hemisphere (the others being Mexico City , Havana , Valparaíso , Buenos Aires , Mar del Plata , and Rosario ) in the Ruta Europea del Modernisme,  an international non-profit association for the promotion and protection of Art Nouveau heritage in the world.  \\n\nToday, Ponce has more museums (nine) than any other municipality in the Island.  Ponce is home to the Museo de Arte de Ponce (MAP), founded in 1959 by fellow ponceño Luis A. Ferré . The museum was operated by Ferré until his death at the age of 99, and it is now under the direction of the Luis A. Ferré Foundation. Designed by Edward Durell Stone , architect of Radio City Music Hall  and the Museum of Modern Art in New York , MAP is the only museum of international stature on the Island, the only one that was accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM),  and the only one that has received a design prize of honor from the American Institute of Architects (AIA).  It houses the most extensive art collection in the Caribbean with 4,500 pieces.  \\n\nMost of Ponce\\'s professional teams are called the Leones de Ponce ( Ponce Lions , or Ponce Lionesses as the case may be) regardless of the sport. The Leones de Ponce basketball team is one of the leading teams of the island, winning 12 championships during their tenure.  The team\\'s venue is the Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium . The Leones de Ponce (men\\'s) baseball and the Leonas de Ponce (women\\'s) baseball teams have also been fairly successful.  The baseball teams\\' venue is the Francisco Montaner Stadium .  The stadium is located next to the Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium.  \\n\nIn 1993 the city hosted the Central American and Caribbean Games , from November 19-30.  \\n\nThe city also hosts two international annual sporting events. In the month of May, it hosts the Ponce Grand Prix , a track and field event in which over 100 athletes participate. During the Memorial Day Weekend in the month of September, the city hosts Cruce a Nado Internacional , a swimming competition with over a dozen countries represented. Also, the Ponce Marathon takes place every December, sometimes as part of the Las Mañanitas event on December 12.\\n\nThe Francisco \"Pancho\" Coimbre Sports Museum , named after the baseball player of the same name, was dedicated to the honor of Puerto Rico\\'s great sports men and women.  It is located on the grounds of the Charles H. Terry Athletic Park on Lolita Tizol Street, just north of the entrance to Historic Ponce at Puente de los Leones (Lions\\' Bridge) and the Ponce Tricentennial Park . In 2012 the city commenced construction of the multi-sport complex Ciudad Deportiva Millito Navarro . No date has been announced for its completion yet, but its skateboarding section opened in March 2013.\\n\nThe main annual sports events are as follows:\\n\nThe municipality is home to several parks and beaches, including both passive and active parks. Among the most popular passive parks are the Julio Enrique Monagas Family Park on Ponce By-pass Road ( PR-2 ) at the location where the Rio Portugués feeds into Bucaná . The Parque Urbano Dora Colon Clavell , another passive park is in the downtown area. Active parks include the Charles H. Terry Athletic Field, and several municipal tennis courts, including one at Poly Deportivos with 9 hard courts, and one at La Rambla with six hard courts.  There are also many public basketball courts scattered throughout the various barrios of the municipality.\\n\nThe municipality has 40 beaches including 28 on the mainland and 12 in Caja de Muertos.  Among these, about a dozen of them are most notable, including El Tuque Beach in the El Tuque sector on highway PR-2, west of the city, La Guancha Beach at the La Guancha sector south of the city, and four beaches in Caja de Muertos : Pelicano, Playa Larga, Carrucho, and Coast Guard beach.  A ferry must be boarded at La Guancha for transportation to the Caja de Muertos beaches.\\n\nDuring and after colonization, the Roman Catholic Church became the established religion of the colony. Gradually African slaves were converted to Christianity, but many incorporated their own traditions and symbols, maintaining African traditions as well. Ponce Cathedral , listed in the National Register of Historic Places , was built in 1839.   The Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 allowed for non-Catholics to immigrate legally to Puerto Rico, but it required those who wanted to settle on the island to make a vow of alliance to the Catholic Church. Ponce was the first city in Puerto Rico where Protestant churches were built.  \\n\nWith the U.S. invasion, there was a significant change in the religious landscape in the City and in Puerto Rico. \"The Protestant missionaries followed the footprints of the United States soldiers, right after the Treaty of Paris was ratified and Puerto Rico was ceded to the American government.\"  By March 1899, eight months after the occupation, executives from the Methodists , Episcopalians , Baptists , Presbyterians , and others, had arranged for an evangelical division whereby Ponce would have Evangelical, Baptist, and Methodist \"campaigns\". With the passing of the Foraker Act in 1900, which established total separation between Church and State, the absolute power of the Catholic Church eroded quickly.  \\n\nVarious Protestant churches were soon established and built in Ponce; today many are recognized as historic sites. Among them are the McCabe Memorial Church (Methodist) (1908),  and the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church (Methodist) (1907).  \\n\nThe bell of the Episcopalian Holy Trinity Church in Barrio Cuarto , rang again  when the Americans arrived on 25 July 1898. Built in 1873, the church was allowed to function by the Spanish Crown under the conditions that its bell would not be rung, its front doors would always remain closed, and its services would be offered in English only.  \\n\n\\nToday, Ponce is home to a mix of religious faiths: both Protestants and Catholics, as well as Muslims , have places of worship in Ponce. Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Pentecostals , Adventists , Evangelicals , Disciples of Christ , and Congregationalists are among the Protestant faiths with a following in Ponce. Catholicism is the faith of the majority of ponceños. In 2009, the Catholic Church had 18 parishes in the municipality, two bishops and 131 priests.  In his Memoirs , Albert E. Lee summed up Ponce\\'s attitude towards religion:\nPonce was not only tolerant, it was indifferent in religious matters. Protestants and Catholics, and even atheists, lived together socially on the friendliest terms. Religion was strictly a personal affair in Ponce while in San Juan at times gave the impression that it was ready to practice the auto-de-fe [sic].\" \nEconomy\nTraditionally the city\\'s economy had depended almost entirely on the sugarcane industry.  Since around the 1950s, however, the town\\'s economy has diversified and today its economy revolves around a mixed-industry manufacturing sector, retail, and tourism.   The building of a mega port , anticipated to be completed in 2012,  is expected to add significantly to the area\\'s economy. Agriculture, retail, and services are also significant players in the local economy. It is considered an agricultural, trade, and distribution center, with manufacturing that includes electronics, communications equipment, food processing, pharmaceutical drugs, concrete plants, scientific instruments and rum distilling as well as an established gourmet coffee agricultural industry.  The city, though, suffers from an unemployment rate that hovers around the 15 percent mark.  \\n\nThe municipality is considered one of the most developed municipalities in Puerto Rico.  Its manufacturing sectors include electronic and electrical equipment, communications equipment, food processing , pharmaceutical drugs , concrete plants , and scientific instruments .  It also produces leather products , needlework , and fish flour to a lesser extent. Ponce is home to the Serralles rum distillery, which manufactures Don Q , and to Industrias Vassallo , a leader in PVC manufacturing. Other important local manufacturers are Ponce Cement , Cristalia Premium Water , Rovira Biscuits Corporation , and Café Rico . Ponce was once the headquarters for Puerto Rico Iron Works , Ponce Salt Industries , and Ponce Candy Industries .\\n\nIn the agricultural sector, the most important products are coffee , followed by plantains , bananas , oranges , and grapefruits . A mix of public and private services, as well as finance, retail sales, and construction round up Ponce\\'s economic rhythm.  Cafe Rico , which metamorphosed from coffee-grower Cafeteros de Puerto Rico, has its headquarters in Ponce.\\n\nFor many years commercial retail activity in Ponce centered around what is now Paseo Atocha . This has shifted in recent years, and most retail activity today occurs in one of Ponce\\'s various malls , in particular Plaza del Caribe . Centro del Sur Mall is also a significant retail area, as is Ponce Mall.  \\n\nPonce is home to Puerto Rico\\'s chief Caribbean port, the Port of Ponce .  The port is expanding to transform it into a mega port, called the Port of the Americas that will operate as an international transshipment port. When fully operational, it is expected to support 100,000 jobs.  \\n\nDemographics\nPonce has consistently ranked as one of the most populous cities in Puerto Rico. Ponce\\'s population, according to the 2010 census, stands at 166,327, with a population density of 1,449.3 persons per square mile (559.6 persons/km 2 ), ranking third in terms of population among Puerto Rican municipalities. As of 2000, speakers of English as a first language accounted for 13.89% of the population.  \\n\nGovernment\nThe municipal government has its seat in the city of Ponce.   Since its foundation in 1692, the city of Ponce has been led by a mayor . Its first mayor was Don Pedro Sánchez de Matos . The 2008 election of María Meléndez Altieri ( PNP ), brought Ponce the first woman to be elected to the mayoral office in the city\\'s history. She was re-elected in 2012 and again in 2016 , and serve as mayor until 2021. In the 2020 election Luis Irizarri Pabón ( PPD ) was elected as mayor and is currently serving as mayor.  Ponce\\'s best known mayor of recent years is perhaps Rafael \"Churumba\" Cordero Santiago ( PPD ), who held office from 1989 until his sudden death on the morning of 17 January 2004, after suffering three successive brain strokes.\\n\nThe city also has a municipal legislature that handles local legislative matters. Ponce has had a municipal council since 1812.  [ f ]  The municipal legislature is composed of 16 civilians elected during the general elections, along with the mayor, state representatives and senators. The delegations are, until the 2020 general election, distributed as follows: 13 legislators of the Popular Democratic Party , two legislators of the New Progressive Party , and one legislator from the Movimento Victoria Ciudadana .\\n\nThe Ponce City Hall has one of the most unusual histories of any city hall throughout the world. \"Originally built in the 1840s as a public assembly hall, Ponce\\'s City Hall was a jail until the end of the 19th century. Current galleries were former cells, and executions were held in the courtyard. Four U.S. presidents spoke from the balcony - Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt and George Bush.\" It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places .  \\n\nIn 2005, the municipality\\'s budget was US$152 million.  In 2010-2011 it was $158 million.  In 2016-2017 the proposed budget was $140 million.  From a business perspective, the Ponce municipal government is generally praised for its efficiency and speediness, thanks to its adoption of the Autonomous Municipality Law of 1991.  \\n\nThe municipality of Ponce is the seat of the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two senators. During the 2020 Puerto Rico Senate election , Marially González and Ramón Ruiz , both from the Popular Democratic Party , were elected as District Senators and are currently serving.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe coat of arms of the municipality is based on the design of the official mayoral seal that was adopted in 1844 under the administration of mayor Salvador de Vives .  \\n\nThe coat of arms of Ponce consists of an escutcheon (shield) in the Spanish tradition. This shield has a field with a party per bend division. The division runs from top left to bottom right. The field is red and black, bordered with a fine golden line. In the center of the shield is the figure of an erect lion standing on a bridge. The top of the bridge is a golden, the middle is red bricks, and the base foundation is gray rocks. Under the bridge there are gray wavy lines. Over the shield rests a five-tower golden stone wall with openings in the form of red windows. To the left of the shield is a coffee tree branch with its fruit, and to the right of the shield is a sugarcane stalk. The symbols of the shield are as follows: The field represents the flag of the municipality of Ponce, divided diagonally in the traditional city colors: red and black. The lion over the bridge alludes to the last name of the conqueror and first governor of Puerto Rico, Juan Ponce de Leon. The waves under the bridge allude to the Rio Portugues, on the banks of which the city was born. The coronet in the form of a five-tower mural crown above the shield allude to the Spanish crown , through which the settlement obtained its city charter. The coffee tree branch and the sugarcane stalk represent the main agricultural basis of the economy of the young municipality.  \\n\nPonce has two official flags, one for the municipality and one for the city proper. The municipal flag, \"the 1692 flag\", was adopted in 1967 via a municipal ordinance . This flag, designed by Mario Ramirez, was selected from among a number of public proposals. It consisted of a rectangular cloth divided by a diagonal line into two equal isosceles triangles . The line ran from the top right-hand corner to the bottom left-hand corner. The top triangle was black; the bottom right triangle was red. On the top triangle was the figure of a lion over a bridge. On the bottom triangle was the word \"Ponce\" with the number \"1692\", the date when the municipality was founded. Ponce Municipal Assembly Order No. 5, Section 5, of Municipal Assembly Year 1966-1967 established that the last Sunday in April is \"Día de la Bandera de Ponce\" (Ponce Flag Day).  \\n\nTen years later, in 1977, a new municipal ordinance introduced a flag, \"the 1877 city flag\" to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the declaration of the city charter. This (1977) flag consisted of a rectangular cloth divided by a diagonal line, creating two equal isosceles triangles, starting from the top left hand corner and ending on the lower right hand corner. The top triangle is red; the bottom triangle is black. In the center of the flag sits the shield of the municipality. Under this shield is the number \"1877\", the year of the founding of the city, and above the shield is the word \"PONCE\". Some flags have the \"1877\" date on the left border of the bottom triangle and the name of the city on the right border of the triangle, as illustrated in the insert on the left.  \\n\nMunicipal services\nThe city\\'s fire department has a history of firsts, including being the first organized fire department in the Island. As the largest city in the island at the time, and de facto economic and social center of Puerto Rico, this in effect also created the first Puerto Rico Fire Department . The Ponce Fire Department also built the first fire station in the Island,   which still stands to this day, and is now open as the Parque de Bombas museum. Also, in 1951, Ponce\\'s Fire Chief Raúl Gándara Cartagena , wrote a book on the firemen\\'s service, which became a firemen\\'s manual in several Latin American countries.  In recognition of the service rendered by its fire fighters, the City of Ponce built them homes resulting in the creation of the 25 de Enero Street near the city\\'s historic district.\\n\nThe city has withstood some nearly catastrophic fires.\\n\nA major fire took place on February 27, 1820,   that \"almost destroyed the early Ponce settlement\". It destroyed 106 \"of the best homes in town.\"  In 1823, then Governor of Puerto Rico, Miguel de la Torre mandated that \"every male from 16 to 60 years old must be a firefighter\".  Those firefighters had to supply their own fire fighting equipment (essentially picks, buckets, and shovels). Once De la Torre left office, this first fire fighting institution started to decay.  \\n\nAnother major fire occurred in La Playa in March 1845,  that destroyed \"most of the Ponce vicinity.\" It significantly damaged the Spanish Customs House in Ponce , this being one of the few buildings left standing after the fire.  The fire burned down the major buildings of the \"Marina de Ponce\".  After this fire, then governor of Puerto Rico Conde de Mirasol (born Rafael de Aristegui y Velez),  created a new fire fighting organization staffed by volunteers.  In 1862, the Ponce Firefighters Corps was reorganized under the administration of Ponce mayor Luis de Quixano y Font , and Tomás Cladellas was named fire chief.  In 1879 the Ponce Fire Corps reorganized again, with a new fire chief, the local architect Juan Bertoli .\\n\nOn September 25, 1880 another fire, took place destroying most of the older civil records (births, baptisms, marriages, etc.) of the Ponce parish.  In 1883, the Ponce firefighter corps reorganized once more, this time in a more definitive fashion when Máximo Meana was mayor of Ponce. During this time the Ponce Fire Corps was made up of 400 firefighters. Its leadership consisted of Julio Steinacher, fire chief, Juan Seix, second fire chief, Oscar Schuch Olivero, Chief of Brigade, and Fernando M. Toro, Supervisor of the Gymnastics Academy. Concurrent with this, the firefighter corps music band was organized. In September 1883, Juan Morel Campos formally organized the Ponce Fire Corps Municipal Band which exists to this day.  \\n\nThe fourth Ponce fire of large proportions occurred on January 25, 1899.  The fire was fought by a group of firefighters among whom was Pedro Sabater and the civilian Rafael Rivera Esbrí , who would later become mayor of the city. The fire started at the U.S. munitions depot on the lot currently occupied by the Ponce High School building and grounds. The heroes in that fire, believed to have saved the city from certain annihilation, are remembered to this day with monuments on their tombs as well as in a monument in the city square Plaza Las Delicias .  As a further gesture of gratitude, a neighborhood of distinctive Victorian-style cottages were constructed to house the firefighters and their families. These houses, painted in the red and black colors of the city, are located along a street named Calle 25 de Enero ( 25 de Enero street ); they are still owned and occupied by the descendants of these firefighters and are a scenic attraction in Ponce\\'s historic center.\\n\nThe Ponce Municipal Police consists of a force of some 500 officers.  This force is complemented by the Puerto Rico Police force. The Ponce Municipal Police has its headquarters at the southwest corner of the intersection of PR-163 ( Las Americas Avenue ) and PR-2R (Carretera Pámpanos). In addition it has three precincts as follows: Cantera , La Guancha , and Coto Laurel , plus specialized units at Port of the Americas (maritime unit), Mariani (transit unit), Belgica (motorcycle unit), and Parque Dora Clavell (tourism unit).\\n\nThe Puerto Rico Police had its Ponce area regional headquarters from 1970 until 2011 on Hostos Avenue.  In 2011 it moved its command center to a new and larger facility further west on Urbanizacion Los Caobos in Barrio Bucana . It commands five precincts in the city: Villa , Playa , Morel Campos , La Rambla , and El Tuque . The Ponce municipal coverage of the Puerto Rico Police force is as follows:\\n\nIn 2002, most of the homicides in Puerto Rico were occurring in San Juan and the greater metropolitan areas of Bayamón, Carolina and Caguas, but Ponce also had a high homicide rate. Also in 2002, Puerto Rico law enforcement officials drafted plans to increase the number of forensic investigators by 25%. The investigators, assigned to the Institute of Forensic Sciences in San Juan, covered homicides in about 65 percent of the island, but the Institute was considering assigning Ponce its own unit.  By mid-year 2005, there had been 25 more murder cases in Ponce than for all of 2004, a significant increase.  \\n\nThe police acknowledged that most crime cases in Puerto Rico are linked to drug-trafficking and illegal weapons. In mid-July 2005, Gov. Aníbal Acevedo Vilá announced a series of measures aimed at lowering Ponce\\'s high murder rate. Some of those measures included the permanent transfer of 100 agents to the area, the appointment of a ballistics expert from the Institute of Forensic Sciences and of two prosecutors for the Department of Justice in Ponce. Puerto Rico Police Superintendent Pedro Toledo admitted that more than 100 agents are actually needed in the Ponce region in 2005, but that \"there would be no additional transfers at the moment to avoid affecting other police areas.\"  \\n\nPonce is a convenient transition point for drug smugglers due to its location on the Caribbean Sea and its proximity to Colombia and Venezuela .  From there packages are then transported to the United States by various means including the United States Postal Service .  The city is included in the area\\'s HIDTA region.  \\n\nAs most of the crime in Ponce is connected to the drug-trade, police have an eye on illegal smuggling through the Port of Ponce  A 2008 government report stated that, \"Drug smuggling in containerized cargo is a significant maritime threat to the HIDTA (High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area) region. The vast and increasing quantity of goods transshipped through the region every year provides drug traffickers with ample opportunity to smuggle illicit drugs into, through, and from the area.  In July 2005, local police scored some points in their fight against drug-trafficking.  \\n\nBy 2007, Ponce had experienced a 61% decline in the rate of violent crimes ( Type I ).  In 2010, there was a further reduction of 12 percent in violent crimes over 2009 statistics.  In August 2013, the Ponce Area Police Region , which includes Ponce and seven other adjacent municipalities, registered 27 fewer Type I crimes that it had by the same period in 2012.  \\n\nFor the Ponce MSA , which includes the city of Ponce, its nineteen surrounding municipal barrios, the municipality of Juana Diaz, and the municipality of Villalba , crime data was tabulated in 2002 (Total MSA Population: 364,849). No data is available for the city or for the municipality of Ponce alone. The following statistics are registered:\\n\n\\nNotes: \\n^ Violent crimes include: murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. \\n^^ Property crimes include: burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. \\n^^^ NNMS, non-negligent manslaughter \\nSource: FBI  \\n\nThere is an FBI satellite office located in Ponce.  \\n\nEducation\nPonce\\'s first school for boys was established in 1820.  Today there are over a hundred public and private schools.  As with the rest of Puerto Rico, public education in Ponce is handled by the Puerto Rico Department of Education . However, the local government is taking on a greater role in public education. On June 13, 2010, the mayor of Ponce announced the creation of a Municipal Education System and a School Board with the objective of obtaining accreditation for what would be the first free bilingual school in the city.  \\n\nThere are also several colleges and universities located in the city, offering higher education, including professional degrees in architecture , medicine , law , and pharmacy . Some of these are:\\n\nThere are also several other technical institutions like the Instituto de Banca y Comercio , Trinity College,  and the Ponce Paramedical College.\\n\nNova Southeastern University , based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida , has a School of Pharmacy campus in Ponce.  \\n\nHealth care\nThe city is served by several clinics and hospitals. There are four comprehensive care hospitals: Hospital Dr. Pila , Hospital San Cristobal, Hospital San Lucas ,  and Hospital de Damas . In addition, Hospital Oncológico Andrés Grillasca specializes in the treatment of cancer,  and Hospital Siquiátrico specializes in mental disorders.  There is also a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic that provides health services to U.S. veterans.  The U.S. Veterans Administration will build a new hospital in the city to satisfy regional needs.  In 2009, Hospital Damas was listed in the U.S. News & World Report as one of the best hospitals under the U.S. flag.  \\nPonce has the highest concentration of medical infrastructure per inhabitant of any municipality in Puerto Rico.\\n\nTransportation\nDue to its commercial and industrial significance, Ponce has consistently been a hub of transportation to the rest of the island.\\n\nPuerto Rico Highway 52 provides access to Salinas , Caguas , and San Juan. PR-2 grants access to southwestern and western municipalities as a full-access freeway. The PR-10 highway, which is still under construction as a faster alternative to PR-123 , provides access to the interior of the island as well as points north of the island, such as Arecibo . PR-1 provides access to various points east and southeast of Puerto Rico, while PR-14 provides access to Coamo and other points in the central mountain region. PR-132 grants country-side access to the town of Peñuelas. PR-123 is the old road to Adjuntas and, while treacherous, it does provide an appreciation for countryside living in some of the municipality\\'s barrios, such as Magueyes and Guaraguao .   \\n\nThe city is served by a network of local highways and freeways. Running entirely within the municipal limits are PR-12 , PR-9 , PR-133 , and PR-163 and a few others. Freeway PR-12 runs northbound starting at the Port of Ponce to connect with PR-14 on the northeastern part of the city. PR-9, also known as the Circuito de Circumnavegación de Ponce (Ponce\\'s Circumferential Highway ), is a highway still partly under construction. It runs mostly north of the city and connects PR-52 to PR-10 in an east-to-west fashion; when completed it will run as a beltway around most of the eastern and northern sections of the city.  PR-133 (Calle Comercio) connects PR-2 in west Ponce to PR-132. It is an extension of PR-1 from its PR-2 terminus into the city center. PR-163 crosses the City east-to-west connecting PR-52 and PR-14.     The municipality has 115 bridges.  \\n\nPonce\\'s public transportation system consists of taxicabs and share taxi service providing public cars and vans known as públicos  and a bus-based mass transit system.  There are five taxi companies in the city.  Most públicos depart from the terminal hub located in downtown Ponce, the Terminal de Carros Públicos Carlos Garay .   During the 1990s and 2000s, there was also a trolley system reminiscent of the one the city used in the 19th century and which traveled through the downtown streets, and which was used mostly by tourists.  Today it is used mostly during special events. There is also a small train that can bring tourists from the historic downtown area to the Paseo Tablado La Guancha on the southern shore,  As with the trolley, today the train is used mostly during special events. A ferry provides service to Isla de Caja de Muertos .  The new intra-city mass transit system, SITRAS , was scheduled to start operating in November 2011,  and, after a 3-month delay, the $4 million SITRAS system, was launched with 11 buses and three routes in February 2012.  A fourth route was to be added for the El Tuque sector according to a June 30, 2012 news report.  \\n\nMercedita Airport sits 3 miles (4.8 km) east of downtown Ponce and handles both intra-island and international flights. The airport, used to be a private airfield belonging to Destilería Serralles rum distillery before it became a commercial airport serving the Ponce area in the 1940s. There is daily commercial non-stop air service to points in the United States.  \\n\nSince 1804, Ponce already boasted its own port facilities for large cargo ships.  The Port of Ponce is Puerto Rico\\'s chief Caribbean port.  It is known as the Port of the Americas and is under expansion to convert it into a major international shipping hub.  It receives both cargo as well as passenger cruise ships.

        "page_content": "Contents\nQuebradillas, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nQuebradillas  is a town and municipality of the island of Puerto Rico located in the northern shore bordering the Atlantic Ocean, north of San Sebastián ; east of Isabela ; and west of Camuy . Quebradillas is spread over seven barrios and Quebradillas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nQuebradillas is called \" La Guarida del Pirata \" (The Pirate\\'s Hideout). A well-known beach in the area, Puerto Hermina , is home to an old structure known to have been a hiding place for pirates and their contraband.\\n\nHistory\nThe town was founded in 1823 by Felipe Ruiz.  There were many factors that cause the inhabitants of this territory of Puerto Rico to be independent from the towns that formed the Hato de la Tuna resulting in the formation of a new municipality. The town lacked chapels or churches, religious services nor priests, a place to bury the dead, a post office, and quality roads to transport. They relied on the neighboring municipalities of Camuy , Hatillo and Isabela . This would however be a problem during the rainy seasons when the Río Camuy and Río Guajataca water level rose resulting in closed off passage to the other municipalities and would sometimes take up to a week for the water level to return to normal. This led the residents of the area to organize a corporation that would look after the political, economic and administrative interests of \"Las Quebradillas\" and its jurisdiction.  This town derives its name from the large number of streams flowing through it. Quebradillas means \"small streams\".\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States.  In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Quebradillas was 7,432.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico.  In Quebradillas, 800 concrete barriers had to be built to stabilize the Guajataca reservoir which suffered a structural failure and was causing a \"life-threatening situation\".    \"It's a structural failure. I don't have any more details,\" Governor Ricardo Rosselló stated. \"We're trying to evacuate as many people as possible.\"  Rosselló ordered the Puerto Rico National Guard and the Police to help assist in the evacuation effort downstream.  The dam lies across the Guajataca River to form a reservoir that can hold roughly 11 billion gallons of water.  \\n\nIn Quebradillas, infrastructure and about 2200 homes were damaged or completely destroyed.  \\n\nGeography\nQuebradillas, located in the Northern Karst , borders on the Atlantic Ocean, is north of San Sebastián ; east of Isabela , and west of Camuy . Quebradillas is home to one of the 20 designated forest preserves in Puerto Rico, the Guajataca State Forest . The forest serves as a great example of an unusual topography known as karst country . Karst is characterized by dissolved limestone formations such as sinkholes and haystack-shaped hills known as \"mogotes\" . It is also home to the beautiful man-made reservoir, Guajataca Lake (2.5 mi or 4.0 km long), where you can fish for largemouth bass , peacock bass , tilapia and bluegill (in Spanish known as \"chopa\"). You can also go hiking or camping . The Puerto Rico Council of the Boy Scouts of America maintains a campground on the lake known as Camp Guajataka . The name Guajataca comes from the name Wahataka , a Taíno chief who lived in this area. This Indian chief also gives his name to Guajataca Beach to the north where Río Guajataca flowing from Guajataca Lake meets the Atlantic Ocean. Guajataca Beach is popular with surfers and is known for its white sands and wild waves. This beach is ideal for sunning and collecting seashells.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Quebradillas is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .    \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Quebradillas: Guajataca, Montadero, Parcelas Italas in Terranova, San Antonio, and Sector Las Piedras Barrio Cocos.  \\n\nClimate\nThe general climate of the town is tropical.\\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nThere are 6 beaches in Quebradillas.  \\n\nThe town of Quebradillas had a private zoo called El Arca de Noé (Noah\\'s Ark), which was in operation for about 50 years. In 2012 it was closed after its owners turned 90 years old and could no longer care for the animals, as a result they were moved to the Dr. Juan A. Rivero Zoo .   The town also had El Museo de Muñecas (Quebradillas Doll Museum) which housed over 1,000 Barbie dolls in Cocos .\\n\nThe main attractions of Quebradillas are:\\n\nEconomy\nA small shopping center called Quebradillas Plaza is located in this municipality.\\n\nAn event which negatively affected the region in the decade of the 1990s was the disappearance of tax exemptions to the private corporations Section 936 of the code of the US Internal Revenue Service , which at the time was the resulted in the closure of one of the greater manufacturers of textiles in the northwest area of the island. This decline of the industry of the needle occurred similarly in the bordering cities like Isabela and Camuy , generating a regional economic decline as the locals greatly depended on these jobs. In nearby towns like Hatillo , Mayagüez and Aguadilla , the arrival of mega stores and new shopping centers attracted the jobs that used to be in Quebradillas.\\n\nThe island lacks mass public transportation, people must resort to private cars. The only road to access the important cities, the Puerto Rico Highway 2 suffers from congestion. The town possesses one tunnel that at the beginning of the 20th century was used by steam driven trains that traveled throughout the Island. This absence aggravates the problem of mass transit and the dependence on privately owned vehicles as these are the only method of transportation.  \\n\nThe economy, entering into the 21st century, is based on retail sales. Many small businesses are located along the two main thoroughfares that cross Quebradillas. These consist mainly of light hardware, bakeries, pharmacies, seafood restaurants, American fast food chains and automobile car repair shops.\\n\nThe town has bank branches for Banco Popular and local savings and credit Unions . These credit unions are most noted for their involvement in common and cultural activities, sponsoring and participating in festivals of typical music such as \"Festival of the Gourd in December\", sports and educational activities.\\n\nCulture\nQuebradillas celebrates its patron saint festival in October. The Fiestas Patronales de San Rafael Arcangel is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Quebradillas include:\\n\nThe town\\'s official basketball team is Los Piratas\\'  who have won a dramatic number of tournaments in the past. Presently the team has made a \"comeback\" and has won the championship of the island (2013).\\n\nGovernment\nThe town\\'s government is a small unit with few powers it can execute. Elections are hosted in specific schools every four years to choose a town mayor.\\n\nThere are several versions detailing different individuals who have served as mayor. An official promotional booklet details 46,  while another source states 47.  It has also been asserted that a woman, Francisca Lamela de Cordero, served between 1944-1945, in a source that presents 56 incumbents,  however she is not included in the municipal-approved list, which expresses that since its founding the town has elected 61 mayors:  \\n\nTransportation\nThere are 4 bridges in Quebradillas.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nIt has two red quarters. The red stands for struggle, effort and sacrifice. The other two-quarters have each five green and white wavy stripes, similar to those that appear in the shield.  \\n\nThe three waved stripes represent the quebradillas (Spanish for creeks or streams), over the green background of the vegetation. The fish and the walking stick (distinctive of the traveler), are insignias of the angel Saint Raphael , by allusion from the episodes narrated in the Book of Tobias in the Old Testament .  \\n\nEducation\nThe town features various public and private schools. There is also a public electronic library near Los Chorritos Pirata water park. In 2021 the municipal government opened a child daycare center.   Some schools have been remodeled as a result of a government initiative to have \"21st century\" schools.\\n\nPrivate schools:\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

It is located in the Western Coastal Valley, west of Añasco and Aguada . Rincón is spread over 9 barrios and Rincón Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nThe municipality is home to many of the surfing beaches in Puerto Rico, including Domes , Marias,  Tres Palmas, Sandy Beach, Pools Beach, Córcega Beach and Rincón Town Beach. The word \"Rincón\" means \"nook\" in Castilian Spanish . Rincón is in the north, on the westernmost tip of Puerto Rico.\\n\nRincon has a large population of Non-Hispanic whites(most from the mainland United States and United Kingdom) when compared to the rest of the Island. Its known to suffer strong gentrification from the increasing Mainland US population moving to the Municipality(Puerto Ricans & Non-Hispanic combined) leading to higher rent prices and higher prices in other commodities such as groceries when compared to neighboring cities.    \\n\nHistory\nRincón was founded in 1771 by Don Luis de Añasco. In 1885, Benito Cumpiano was mayor of Ríncon and in 1890, Victor Cumpiano was Ríncon\\'s mayor.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Rincón was 6,641.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Rincón, infrastructure was damaged and about 400 homes were damaged or completely destroyed. Intense rainfall and winds triggered numerous landslides.   The storm surge bought 4 feet of water into homes on the coast.  \\n\nGeography\nRincón is located on the western coast of Puerto Rico,  on the westernmost tip.  \\n\nUpdated flood zone maps (as of 2019) show that Rincón is extremely vulnerable to flooding , along with Humacao , Toa Baja , Barceloneta , and Corozal . For its high levels of erosion, Rincón is vulnerable in the case of a major hurricane .  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Rincón is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, main central square and large Catholic church are located in a downtown barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English).

Since then, surfers from around the world have been visiting Rincón.\\n\nRincón has a tourism economy which also boasts scuba diving, snorkeling, and sunsets.  Rincón has also been an area for internet-based companies to set up shop.\\n\nIn 2007, Rincón was the site for the ISA World Masters where local surfer Juan Ashton won first place in the Masters division.\\n\nFruits and sugarcane are the primary sources of agriculture in Rincón. Cattle ranching also is popular.\\n\nThe major industry of Rincón is tourism.   \\n\nThe Boiling Nuclear Superheater (BONUS) Reactor Facility , also known to the locals as \"the Domes\", is a decommissioned nuclear plant . The construction of BONUS started in 1960, and the reactor had its first controlled nuclear chain reaction on April 13, 1964, achieving full power operation in September 1965. Operation of the BONUS reactor was terminated in June 1968 because of technical difficulties and the ensuing need for high-cost modifications.  General decontamination of the reactor was performed with the goal of meeting unrestricted use criteria in all accessible areas of the building. Residual radioactive materials remaining in the structure were isolated or shielded to protect site visitors and workers. During subsequent years, more radioactive contamination was identified in portions of the building, and additional clean-up and shielding activities were conducted in the 1990s and early 2000s.  It was Puerto Rico\\'s only nuclear reactor.\\n\nDemographics\nRincón reported the smallest decline in population of any Puerto Rican municipality between the 2010 and 2020 censuses (no municipality recorded an increase). The population fell by only 13, less than 0.1% of the overall population.  \\n\nAs of 2020, 5.1% of the population is of non-Hispanic origin, making Rincón the least Hispanic municipality on the Puerto Rican mainland. This represents an increase from 2010, when only 3.6% of the population was non-Hispanic.  \\n\nTourism\n\"Art Walk\", a community initiative to build the social fabric of Rincón, takes places every Thursday. Locals and tourists mingle in the main town square Plaza de recreo in downtown Rincón to enjoy food, drinks, music and local art.  \\n\nThere are 53 beaches in Rincón.  \\nMain attractions of Rincón include:\\n\nCulture\nRincón is well known as a surfing destination. Rincón rose to international recognition through the 1968 World Surfing Championship , which was held at Domes and Maria\\'s Beaches. The winter surf along Rincón\\'s coast is some of the best in the region. Generally regarded as one of the best surf spots across the globe, Rincón draws surfers from around the world and is the center of the island\\'s surf scene. Dubbed the \" Caribbean \\'s Hawaii,\" winter waves here can approach 25-30 feet (6.7m) in height, sometimes equaling the force of the surf on Oahu \\'s north shore. Famed surfing beaches in town include Little Malibu , Tres Palmas, Maria\\'s, Indicators, Domes, Pools, Sandy Beach and Antonio\\'s. The best time to surf is from November through March, but summer storms can also kick up the surf during the late summer.\\n\nRincón celebrates its patron saint festival in September. The Fiestas Patronales de Santa Rosa de Lima is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Rincón include:\\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Rincón is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Carlos López Bonilla , from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). López was elected at the 2000 general election .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district IV , which is represented by two senators. In 2016, Luis Daniel Muñiz Cortés and Evelyn Vázquez were elected as district senators.  \\n\nTransportation\nThere are 8 bridges in Rincón.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nCreated and designed by Evaristo Cardona Moreno and art performed by Jose Luis Cardona Martinez (his eldest son). The colors of the Rincón flag are red, orange, yellow, green and white. The triangle has a five-pointed white star representing the urban zone. There are white stars of equal size which represent the 9 barrios. The red and orange symbolize the vitality and vigor of its people. The yellow symbolizes Christianity, the green symbolizes vegetation and hope for progress and the white symbolizes the integrity between its barrios and urban zone.  \\n\nCreated and designed by Angel L. Cardona Moreno, the shield consists of a green and orange Spanish blazon, with a yellow band inclined left to right. To the right and on a green background a cross, symbol of Christendom. To the left and on an orange background a Spanish ship, symbol of the discovery of Puerto Rico, in the coasts of Rincón (this is greatly disputed, as the towns of Aguada , Rincón, and Añasco all claim entry-point status).  \\n\nNotable people\nGallery\nSome of the scenes in Rincón:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nSabana Grande, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nSabana Grande  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located north of Lajas and Guánica ; south of Maricao ; east of San Germán ; and west of Yauco . Sabana Grande is spread over seven barrios and Sabana Grande Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Germán-Cabo Rojo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nThe municipality\\'s name comes from the extensive plain that occupies the southern part of the municipality which extends towards the west to San German and Hormigueros , better known as the Sabana Grande Valley ( Spanish for the big savanna valley ; the word sabana and the English savanna both come from the Taino word for plains ). According to historian Mario Villar Roces, before 1808 there was a community with its own church on the land today known as Sabana Grande Arriba (literally upper great savanna ). Evidence of this is the oldest baptismal registry preserved from the area, as Sabana Grande was originally a sector of the municipality of San Germán.\\n\nBecause the community was so far from the center of San Germán, residents felt a need to build a church, which was established as an auxiliary to the San Germán parish . The church was built and was devoted to San Isidro Labrador and Santa María de la Cabeza .\\n\nDuring Spanish rule , in order for a town to be established, the following had to take place: A group of vecinos (\"neighbors\" or residents) that wanted to found a town had to grant a power of attorney to one or more other vecinos to represent them before the governor and viceroy . This person could authorize the founding of the town and the establishment of a parish. The grantors of the power of attorney had to be a majority in the given territory and more than ten in number. Once the case had been made, the governor appointed a \"capitán poblador\" or settlement official to represent the vecinos and one or more delegates, who usually lived in nearby aldeas, or hamlets. Proof was required that the settlement was so far from a church that it was very difficult for the settlers to partake of sacraments and municipal services. In general, proof was provided of the absence or bad condition of roads and bridges. If the petition was approved, it was required that the vecinos mark off the new municipality and build public works such as a church, a parish house, a government house (Casa del Rey), a slaughterhouse, and a cemetery, and to set aside land for the town square or plaza and the commons (ejidos). The vecinos were expected to cover the cost of building these works by levying special assessments. Usually one of the land owners donated some land for the founding. Once the requirements had been met, the governor authorized the founding of the town and the parish, and he appointed a Lieutenant at War who usually was the same capitán poblador.\\n\nThere is some debate as to when Sabana Grande was founded. Some say that it was established in 1808, while others say it was established in 1813, a year after the town was politically established in 1812. Historian Villar Roces posits that although the exact date of the founding of the town is not found in any document in the municipal archives, 1813 should be considered the year it was legally founded because it coincides with the date of the first registry document. In entry number 23 in the third book of marriages, dated July 1, 1813, the priest is identified as \"Priest Ecónomo of the Sabana Grande Parish Church,\" while previous entries were called \"Attending Priests\" or \"Coadjutants of the Villa of San Germán.\"\\n\nSabana Grande became an independent parish, under its own jurisdiction, in June 1813, with the first parish priest of the San Isidro Labrador y Santa María de la Cabeza Church being Martín Antonio Borreli.\\n\nOn December 21, 1814, the first captain general of Sabana Grande, Pedro de Acosta, took office. Some local historians assert that he donated seventy cuerdas of land where the Kings House, priests house, a plaza, a butcher shop and a cemetery were established. Others say that this land was donated by Joaquín P. Rodríguez de la Seda y Almodóvar. Villar Roces adds that Juan Francisco de Acosta, brother of the mayor and parish priest of Sabana Grande, donated his house to the town so it could be used as the Kings House or council house.\\n\nThe first families of Sabana Grande were the Vélez Borrero, García Almodóvar, Nazario de Figueroa, Acosta, Sanabria, Lugo, Rivera, Sepúlveda, del Toro, Montalvo, Irizarry, Borreli, Ramírez, Torres, Matos, Pabón-Dávila, Quiñones, Rodríguez de la Renta, Soltero, Segarra, Ortiz de la Renta, Ortiz de Peña, Saavedra and others. Also, Catalan families with the surnames of Busigó, Malaret and Serra, and a group of Greek immigrants with the surname Soto, all settled in the town from the time of its founding.   \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Sabana Grande with the significant amount of rainfall.   \\n\nGeography\nSabana Grande is on the south west side of Puerto Rico, in the Lajas Valley . There are a number of rivers there: Río Guanajibo and its tributaries, Coco River , Flores River , and Río Grande .  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Sabana Grande is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .    \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English).

In the center is the municipal coat of arms. The meaning of the flag comes from the coat of arms.  \\n\nThe municipality\\'s coat of arms contains the elements that represent the town\\'s patron saints. The shovel and rake allude to San Isidro Labrador. It is believed this representation arose from the faith of the workers in the Sabana Grande countryside. When a bad drought came, they made promises in the hopes that their patron saint would save their crops. The urn represents the domestic tasks of Santa María de la Cabeza , the wife of San Isidro.  \\n\nIn the center is the leaf of the petate palm as an icon of a traditional industry of Sabana Grande. Above is the crown wall which, as a symbol of solidarity, civic unity and common defense, is a heraldic tribute that is part of the coat of arms of towns.

San Germán is spread over eighteen barrios plus San Germán Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is both a principal city of the San Germán-Cabo Rojo Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Mayagüez-San Germán-Cabo Rojo Combined Statistical Area .\\nSan Germán is the second oldest city of Puerto Rico, after San Juan , and its historic downtown is preserved as the San Germán Historic District .  \\n\nPuerto Rico was, at one time, divided administratively between the San Juan and the San Germán municipalities. The latter covered the western half of Puerto Rico and extended from the western shores of the island to Arecibo in the north and Ponce in the south.  \\n\nHistory\nThe population of San Germán when Alonso Manso was named the first bishop of Puerto Rico in 1511 was \"about 50 residents\".  Outside of San Juan, Puerto Rico, San Germán was one of the largest settlements in the 16th century, as well as Coamo and Aguada .  \\n\nSpanish settlement in San Germán occurred early in the conquest and colonization of Puerto Rico. After the destruction of a small early settlement of the same name near modern-day Añasco during a Taíno uprising which started in February 1511, in 1512  the new settlement was built by Miguel Díaz at Guayanilla  \\nand was named after Germaine of Foix , the second wife of King Fernando II , and in reference of Saint Germanus of Auxerre .   This town was attacked by French corsairs in August 1528, May 1538 and 1554. The construction of a small fort began in 1540, but work stopped in 1546 when the population of the town began moving inland to the current modern location. [ citation needed ] \\n\nOn May 12, 1571, the Royal Audience ( Real Audiencia ) of Santo Domingo authorized that both the populations of San Germán and Santa María de Guadianilla be merged into a single city due to the constant French attacks.  The new city was built on the Hills of Santa Marta , next to the Guanajibo River in 1573. Its official name was Nueva Villa de Salamanca , named after the city of Salamanca in Spain. However, the population called the city San Germán el Nuevo ( New San Germán ) and, eventually, the Villa de San Germán (City of San Germán).\\n\nSan Germán is also known as the \" founder of towns \", given the fact that in 1514 the Spanish Crown separated the island into two administrative territories ( Partidos ). The borders of the two partidos were established as the Camuy River to the north and the Jacagua River to the south. They were named the San Juan Partition and the San Germán Partition .

        "page_content": "Contents\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico\nPage version status\nThis is an accepted version of this page\n\\n\\n\nSan Juan  is the capital city and most populous municipality in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , an unincorporated territory of the United States . As of the 2020 census , it is the 57th-largest city under the jurisdiction of the United States, with a population of 342,259. San Juan was founded by Spanish colonists in 1521, who called it Ciudad de Puerto Rico (\"City of Puerto Rico\" , Spanish for rich port city ).\\n\nPuerto Rico\\'s capital is the second oldest European-established capital city in the Americas, after Santo Domingo , in the Dominican Republic , founded in 1496,  and is the oldest European-established city under United States sovereignty . Several historical buildings are located in the historic district of Old San Juan ; among the most notable are the city\\'s former defensive walls , Fort San Felipe del Morro and Fort San Cristóbal , and La Fortaleza , the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas. These historic sites were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.  \\n\nToday, San Juan is Puerto Rico\\'s most important seaport  and is the island\\'s financial, cultural, and tourism center . The population of the metropolitan statistical area , including San Juan and the municipalities of Bayamón , Guaynabo , Cataño , Canóvanas , Caguas , Toa Alta , Toa Baja , Carolina and Trujillo Alto , is about 2.443 million inhabitants; thus, about 76% of the population of Puerto Rico now lives and works in this area.  San Juan is also a principal city of the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area . The city has been the host of events within the sports community, including the 1979 Pan American Games ; 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games ; events of the 2006, 2009 and 2013 World Baseball Classics ; the Caribbean Series and the Special Olympics and MLB San Juan Series in 2010.\\n\nHistory\nThe Taíno people were the original inhabitants of the area before the arrival of the Europeans to the island of Puerto Rico in 1493. Remains of a small indigenous fishing village have been found in Puerta de Tierra where the Puerto Rico National Guard Museum stands today, however most archaeological sites in the region have been destroyed and lost throughout the colonial history.  The area of San Juan used to be the boundary between the tribal regions (yucayeques) of Guaynabo and Haimanio , led by the chiefs ( caciques ) Mabo and Yuisa (also known as Loaíza), respectively, at the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors .   \\n\nIn 1508, Juan Ponce de León founded the original settlement which he called Caparra . It was named after a former Roman city in the province of Cáceres in Spain,  the birthplace of Nicolás de Ovando , then the Governor of Spain\\'s Caribbean territories.  Today, it is part of the Pueblo Viejo district of Guaynabo , directly to the west of the modern municipality of San Juan. A year later, the settlement was moved to a site then called Puerto Rico , Spanish for \"rich port\" or \"good port\", after its similar geographical features to the town of Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands .  \\n\nThe local Catholic diocese , the second oldest in the Americas and the oldest in the United States, was founded in the newly built settlement on August 8 of 1511.  In 1521, the newer settlement was given its formal name: Ciudad de Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista . Many of the oldest European-founded institutions in the Western Hemisphere, such as the Santo Tomás de Aquino Convent and the Nuestra Señora de la Concepción Hospital, were established during this time in San Juan.  \\n\nThe ambiguous use of San Juan Bautista and Puerto Rico for both the city and the island in time led to a reversal in practical use by most inhabitants: by 1746 the name for the city (Puerto Rico) had become that of the entire island, leading to the city being identified as Puerto Rico de Puerto Rico on maps of the era.    \\n\nSan Juan, as a settlement of the Spanish Empire , was used by merchant and military ships traveling from Spain as the first stopover in the Americas . Because of its prominence in the Caribbean, a network of fortifications was built to protect the transports of gold and silver from the New World to Europe. Because of the rich cargoes, San Juan became a target of the foreign powers of the time.  \\n\nSan Juan underwent attacks from the English led by Sir Francis Drake in 1595 (in what is known as the Battle of Puerto Rico ) and by George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland , in 1598. Artillery from San Juan\\'s fort, El Morro , repelled Drake; however, Clifford managed to land troops and lay siege to the city.  After a few months of English occupation, Clifford was forced to abandon the siege when his troops began to suffer from exhaustion and sickness. In 1625 the city was sacked by Dutch forces led by Captain Balduino Enrico (also known as Boudewijn Hendricksz/Bowdoin Henrick), but El Morro withstood the assault and was not taken. The Dutch were counterattacked by Captain Juan de Amézqueta and 50 members of the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico with a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of Amézqueta.  [ unreliable source? ] \\n\nThe Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city\\'s militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze. Captains Amézqueta and Andrés Botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy\\'s front and rear guard. They drove Enrico and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in their haste to reach their ships.  \\n\nThe British attack in 1797, during the French Revolutionary Wars , led by Sir Ralph Abercromby (who had just conquered Trinidad ). His army laid siege to the city but was forced to withdraw in defeat as the Puerto Rican defenses proved more resilient than those of Trinidad. Various events and circumstances, including liberalized commerce with Spain, the opening of the island to immigrants as a direct result of the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 , and the colonial revolutions, led to an expansion of San Juan and other Puerto Rican settlements in the late 18th and early 19th century.\\n\nOn May 8, 1898, United States Navy ships, among them USS Detroit , USS Indiana , USS New York , USS Amphitrite , USS Terror and USS Montgomery , commanded by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson arrived at San Juan Bay.   USS Yale captured the Spanish freighter Rita in San Juan Bay, thus being the first hostile encounter between the warring sides in Puerto Rico. On May 9, Yale fought a brief battle with an auxiliary cruiser of Spain, name unknown, resulting in a Spanish victory. Around this time, Captain \\xc3\\x81ngel Rivero Méndez was assigned the command of the Spanish forces in the fortress of San Cristóbal in San Juan. On May 10, Yale returned to San Juan Bay, Rivero-Méndez ordered his men to open fire upon Yale using an Ordoñez 15-centimeter cannon, thus becoming the first attack against the Americans in Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War .  \\n\nFor his actions, Captain Rivero-Méndez was awarded the \"Cruz de la Orden de Mérito Militar\" (The Cross of the Order of the Military Merit) first class.  The residents of San Juan were furious with Rivero and blamed him for the destruction caused to their city by the American bombardments. Nothing came of those accusations and Capt. Rivero-Méndez was ordered to turn over the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed.  \\n\nOn July 25, General Nelson A. Miles landed at Guánica (in southwestern Puerto Rico) with 3,300 soldiers in what was known as the Puerto Rican Campaign . The American troops found some resistance and engaged the Spanish and Puerto Rican troops in battle, the most notable of these the battles of Yauco and Asomante . All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended August 13, 1898, after President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon , acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice .   Spain ceded the island to the United States later the same year by signing the Treaty of Paris .\\n\nCamp Las Casas , located in the district of Santurce , served as the main training camp for the Puerto Rican soldiers prior to World War I and World War II; the majority of the men trained in this facility were assigned to the \"Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry\" which was renamed the 65th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army by the Reorganization Act of June 4, 1920. The 65th Infantry was deactivated in 1956 and became the only unit ever to be transferred from an active Army component to the Puerto Rico National Guard .  \\n\nLieutenant Teófilo Marxuach (retired as a Lieutenant Colonel), a native of Arroyo, Puerto Rico , fired what is considered to be the first shot of World War I fired by the regular armed forces of the United States against any ship flying the colors of the Central Powers .  Marxuach, who was a member of the \"Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry\" and Officer of the Day, on March 25, 1915, opened fire on the Odenwald , an armed German supply vessel, when it was trying to force its way out of San Juan\\'s bay.  The shots ordered by Lt. Marxuach were the first fired by the United States in World War I.  \\n\nIn 1919, Félix Rigau Carrera , \"El Aguila de Sabana Grande\" (The Eagle from Sabana Grande ), the first Puerto Rican pilot, became the first native Puerto Rican to fly an aircraft in the island when he flew his Curtiss JN-4 from Las Casas. At the time, the area was used by the military as an air base and it was also Puerto Rico\\'s first commercial airport, and Rigau Carrera was allowed to perform his historic flight from the airfield.  Camp Las Casas was eventually closed down, and in 1950 a public housing project by the name of Residencial Fray Bartolome de Las Casas was constructed on its former location.\\n\nOn January 2, 1947, the people of San Juan elected Felisa Rincón de Gautier (also known as Doña Fela) (1897-1994) as their mayor. Thus, she became the first woman to be elected as the mayor of a capital city in any of the Americas.  During the Cold War era, she ordered the establishment of the island\\'s first Civil Defense system under the directorship of Colonel Gilberto José Marxuach (Teófilo\\'s son).  Rincón de Gautier served as mayor until January 2, 1969.\\nOn October 30, 1950, San Juan was the scene of the San Juan Uprising , one of many uprisings which occurred in various towns and cities in Puerto Rico, by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party against the governments of Puerto Rico and the United States. Among the uprising\\'s main objective was to attack La Fortaleza and the United States Federal Court House Building in Old San Juan . The \"La Fortaleza battle\", which ensued between the nationalists and the police lasted 15 minutes and ended when four of the five attackers were killed.  \\n\nSan Juan has experienced periods of both stagnation and development in the recent years. Gentrification has been noticeable in areas of the city such as Loíza Street in Santurce  and Santa Rita in Río Piedras.   In recent years the city has been the location of multiple strikes and protests, such as the 2001 protests against the United States Navy in the island municipality of Vieques , the 2010 and 2011 University of Puerto Rico strikes , and the 2019 protests against Governor Ricardo Rosselló which resulted in his resignation.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made a direct impact in Puerto Rico, causing widespread damage and a collapse of the infrastructure in San Juan and the rest of Puerto Rico. The damage caused in 2017 was extensive, affecting the electricity, potable water supplies, transportation, and communication, but significant progress had been made in the capital by April 2019, and particularly by October 2019. This was significant for tourism, which had rebounded by October of that year and was close to the pre-Maria era.  \\n\nSan Juan today remains an important cultural, financial and industrial center not only of Puerto Rico but of the Caribbean region. As the biggest industrial center of Puerto Rico, it is the home of industries such as tobacco processors, breweries, refining facilities for petroleum and sugar, and distillers of rum as well as manufacturers of metal products, cement, pharmaceuticals, and clothing.  The Puerto Rico Convention Center , opened in 2005, is the largest of its kind in the Caribbean and one of the most advanced in the Americas.   \\n\nGeography\nSan Juan is located along the north-eastern coast of Puerto Rico in the Northern Plains region. It lies south of the Atlantic Ocean; north of Caguas and Trujillo Alto ; east of Guaynabo ; and west of Carolina . The city occupies an area of 76.93 square miles (199.2 km 2 ), of which, 29.11 square miles (75.4 km 2 ) (37.83%) is water. San Juan\\'s main water bodies are San Juan Bay and two natural lagoons, the Condado and San José .  At almost 1,030 feet (314 m) above sea level, the highest point in the municipality of San Juan is located on an unnamed hill on the Morcelo sector of Caimito , close to the municipal border with Caguas .  \\n\nThe municipality of San Juan is surrounded by the San Juan metropolitan area , particularly the highly urbanized municipalities of Guaynabo , Trujillo Alto and Carolina . These municipalities, together with Bayamón and Cataño , form what is locally referred to as the \\xc3\\x81rea Metro , the core of the wider San Juan metropolitan area. In total 41 municipalities are included in the entire metropolitan area extends throughout the island\\'s northern coast and central eastern regions.   \\n\nSan Juan has a tropical monsoon climate ( Am ) with year-round growing season . It has an average temperature of 81.0 °F (27.2 °C). Temperatures of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher are seen on an average 79 days annually, more commonly occurring during the wetter months of the northern summer, especially if the winds come from the south.  \\n\nIn the winter, temperatures can drop to around 60 °F (16 °C). The average winter low is 71 °F (22 °C). The coolest temperature officially recorded was 60 °F (16 °C) on March 3, 1957, and the hottest was 98 °F (37 °C) on October 9, 1981.  The record cold daily maximum is 71 °F (22 °C) on February 4, 1935. The record warm daily minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) on August 11, 1995, the most recent of four occasions.  \\n\nWith a mean minimum of 67 °F (19 C), San Juan is in USDA plant hardiness zone 13B, which is the highest category. Rainfall is well-distributed throughout the year. The months of January, February, and March are the driest. As March averages just 1.95 inches (49.5 mm) of rain, the city falls under the tropical monsoon category.  \\n\nRainfall averages 56.35 inches (1,431.3 mm), falling on an average 198.5 days per year.  Despite this dampness, the city averages 2,970 hours of sunshine per year, or just over 2 ⁄ 3 of the possible total.  Annual rainfall has historically ranged from 35.53 in (902 mm) in 1991 to 89.50 in (2,273 mm) in 2010.  \\n\nAs with other parts of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, San Juan is often blanketed by waves of Saharan dust coming from the Sahara across the Atlantic Ocean in Northern Africa . Although beneficial to the tropical environment,  these dust storms have recently become hazardous to human health causing haze and overheating in urban areas of the island. Due to San Juan\\'s relatively flat geography, the dust often settles in these flat coastal regions of Puerto Rico as its flow is blocked by the higher altitude Cordillera Central to the south, causing intense episodes of haze to settle for long periods of time, especially during periods of more scarce rainfall.  Recent advancements include early warning systems to prepare the population for these intense episodes by both local authorities and the EPA .  \\n\nHurricane Maria made landfall in southeastern Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017.   Gusts of up to 113 mph (182 km/h) were reported in the capital city shortly before landfall in the municipality of Yabucoa .  The municipality of San Juan experienced widespread flooding in most coastal areas, and roofs were blown off from numerous structures.   The neighborhood of La Perla was largely destroyed.  In the wider metropolitan area, flooding from Lake La Plata produced flash floods that trapped residents of Toa Baja , and in Cataño the Juana Matos neighborhood was estimated to be 80% destroyed.  At least eight people died from the flooding, while many were unaccounted for.  \\n\nSee or edit raw graph data . \\n\nSan Juan is home to numerous beaches , all of which are open to the public.  All beaches of San Juan face the Atlantic Ocean. The Islet of San Juan hosts Los Cables Beach and La Perla Beach next to the Old San Juan district of La Perla , the Capitolio Beach located immediately north of the Puerto Rico Capitol, Puerta de Tierra Beach along the Paseo de Puerta de Tierra , and El Escambrón Beach at the northeastern edge of the islet. The latter is the most popular beach in the islet due to its shore being protected from the strong Atlantic Ocean waves by reefs that serve as natural breakwaters .  From east to west, the beaches in Santurce include Ocean Park Beach (also known as \\xc3\\x9altimo Trolley Beach), Condado Beach and Playita del Condado . Ocean Park Beach and El Condado Beach are the largest in the city and they host a large number of hotels and businesses that cater to tourists and beachgoers.   \\n\nAs with other beaches across Puerto Rico and the Caribbean,  the beaches of San Juan are currently under the threat of coastal erosion , particularly that of Ocean Park.  The threat has become more evident recently and there are currently no state reports dedicated to the documentation or mitigation planning, according to oceanographer and geologist Maritza Barreto.  \\n\nThe municipality of San Juan contains numerous parks, including public parks, historic and heritage parks, nature reserves, protected natural areas, and recreational parks. These parks are managed by a number of entities such as the Municipality, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources , the National Park Service , the University of Puerto Rico and conservation easements .\\n\nThe San Juan Ecological Corridor is a conservation project by the Government of Puerto Rico consisting in 6 different units found within the municipality of San Juan: the Cupey Arboretum, which protects the riparian ecosystems along the Río Piedras ; the Doña Inés Mendoza Urban Forest , a small urban forest located next to the Luis Muñoz Marín Foundation in Sabana Llana Sur ; Los Capuchinos Forest , a forest which covers a small karst area also in Sabana Llana Sur; the New Millennium State Forest , one of the 20 state forests of Puerto Rico ; the San Juan Waterworks , consisting of the Old Piedras River Aqueduct and adjacent historic district ; and the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden, also known as the San Juan Botanical Garden .  \\n\nThe San Juan National Historic Site is home to El Morro Esplanade , a large open area located between El Morro and Ballajá in Old San Juan . The esplanade is located in the promontory which gives El Morro its name and it offers views of the San Juan Bay and the rest of San Juan. It is very popular for activities such as picnics, stargazing  and kite flying .  \\n\nThe district of the Capitol of Puerto Rico is home to the Iglesias Pantín and Rafael Hernández Marín parks, and a line of monuments located along Constitución Avenue which includes the Walkway of the Presidents , the Puerto Rico Police Memorial Monument and The Holocaust Memorial Monument. The Loma de los Vientos , or Loma del Viento (Spanish for \"hill of winds\"), is a small open green area located northwest of the Capitol, next to Castle San Cristóbal , and it often hosts events such as the Epiphany celebrations.  \\n\nLuis Muñoz Rivera Park is a 27.2 acre recreational and historic park located in Puerta de Tierra , between Luis Muñoz Rivera, Ponce de León and Constitución avenues. It is the largest public square in Puerto Rico, and it is home to several historic sites such as the Polvorín San Gerónimo de Boquerón , which used to supply gunpowder to the nearby Fortín de San Gerónimo . The park used to host a small zoo, and currently hosts gazebos, gardens, restaurants and access to the beach. The park has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since November 14, 2007.  \\n\nThe Polvorin de Miraflores is a historic district and park located next to the Puerto Rico Convention Center in Isla Grande , Santurce . The ammunition storage house dates to the mid-18th century and it is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  \\n\nAnother historic district currently under revitalization is the San Juan Waterworks historic district which contains the Old Piedras River Aqueduct. There are plans to revitalize the old aqueduct structures and its surroundings to create a historic park open to visitors and researchers.  \\n\nSome of the recreational parks of the municipality include Bahía Urbana , a waterfront park located in Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra by the San Juan Bay; the Paseo de Puerta de Tierra , a recreational walkway along the Atlantic Ocean cliffs of Puerta de Tierra that connects the Puerto Rico Capitol with El Escambrón Beach and Luis Muñoz Rivera Park.\\n\nVentana al Mar , Laguna del Condado Jaime Benítez Park, Parque del Indio are some of the parks located in El Condado district of Santurce. Dr. José Celso Barbosa Park is located in Ocean Park , also in Santurce. Parque Central , also known as the San Juan Municipal Central Park, is a large park and recreational complex located in southern Santurce near the mouth of the Puerto Nuevo River and the Martín Peña Channel . The Enrique Martí Coll Linear Park connects the Central Park to Hato Rey through the Caño Martín Peña Nature Reserve .  \\n\nLuis Muñoz Marín Park , La Merced Park, Dr. José N. Gándara Park, Santiago Iglesias Pantín Park are some of the parks located in Hato Rey.  Luis Muñoz Marín Park is one of the largest in the municipality. It is located in the Gobernador Piñero district between Hato Rey and Puerto Nuevo . The park has gazebos that can be rented for events, green areas for strolls, biking and picnics, an artificial lake with paddleboats for rent ($6), and a number of playgrounds for children. Its main attraction is the cableway that crosses the park and offers scenic views of the Piedras River and the city while providing transportation to the Roberto Clemente Coliseum and the Hiram Bithorn Stadium .  \\n\nThe municipality of San Juan is home to various important ecosystems and preserved natural areas. Some of the ecosystems of the San Juan Bay National Estuary , which is the only tropical estuary in the National Estuary Program network, are protected by numerous nature reserves and protected areas such as the Caño Martín Peña Nature Reserve . Other areas protected under the San Juan Bay National Estuary include El Condado Lagoon , the San José Lagoon and El Boquerón where the San Antonio Creek and the Condado Lagoon connect with the Atlantic Ocean.  \\n\nTwo of the 20 state forests of Puerto Rico are located in the municipality of San Juan: the New Millennium Urban Forest , which is also part of the San Juan Ecological Corridor, and the San Patricio Urban Forest , a secondary forest located next to a mogote . The Hermanas Sendra and San Juan Park Protected Natural Areas are located inland within the municipality of San Juan in the barrios of Caimito and Cupey .  \\n\nCityscape\nThe architecture of San Juan is very diverse, due to its size and all the cultural influences received during its existence. The oldest part of the city, known as Old San Juan , mostly features the influence of Spanish architecture . This part of the city is comprised by a network of \"setted\" roads usually surrounded by colonial, two-storied houses built on masonry . Some colonial structures have been restored and serve either as government offices or museums.  Some examples are the Ballajá Barracks , which now serve as museum and headquarters of several cultural organizations; La Fortaleza , which has served as the residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico since the 16th Century; and the Ancient Welfare Asylum, which now houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, among others. Old San Juan also features several public squares, like the Plaza de Armas , located in front of San Juan City Hall; and cathedrals, like the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista .  Old San Juan is also notable for being partly enclosed by massive walls and fortifications built by the Spanish government . The colonial Walls of the city of San Juan had five gates. The main was the Puerta de San Juan, today preserved, built in 1635. It also had the Puerta de San José, the Puerta de Santa Rosa, the Puerta de San Justo and the Puerta de Santiago, the latter built between 1635 and 1641 by Spanish Captain General \\xc3\\x8dñigo de la Mota Sarmiento.\\n\nThe architecture is more varied in other districts of the city, and the different Spanish , American and Puerto Rican construction styles that reflect the historic architecture trends are most evident in the districts of Puerta de Tierra , Santurce , Hato Rey and downtown Río Piedras , with Gothic , Baroque , Art Deco , and Mid-Century Modern being the most popular styles.  Many of the buildings that best exemplify these architectural trends in San Juan are also inscribed in the United States National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), such as the Nuestra Señora de Lourdes Chapel ( Gothic Revival , 1907),  the Antiguo Casino de Puerto Rico ( Beaux-Arts , 1917),  the Normandie Hotel ( Art Deco , 1942),  and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Building ( Modern , 1955).  The University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus is also home to a rich variety of buildings that showcase the history of Puerto Rican architecture throughout the past 120 years, with buildings designed by notable architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright \\'s student Henry Klumb , Edward H. Bennett , William E. Parsons ,  and Rafael Carmoega who designed the distinctive clock tower and the university quadrangle , both of which were inscribed in the NRHP in 1984.  \\n\nAs with the other Puerto Rican municipalities, San Juan is administratively divided into barrios . What is now known as Old San Juan occupied the western end of a rocky islet, the Isleta de San Juan , at the mouth of San Juan Bay. During the 20th century, the main population centers surged well beyond the walls of the old city and onto Puerto Rico\\'s main island and merged with the existing settlements east and south of Old San Juan. Together with Puerta de Tierra , Old San Juan comprises the barrio of San Juan Antiguo .\\n\nWith the annexation of Río Piedras in 1951, the municipality of San Juan grew to four times its previous size. As a result, the municipality also went from 2 to 18 barrios (barrios),  16 of which fall within the former municipality of Río Piedras . Eight of the 18 barrios are further subdivided into subbarrios, including the two barrios ( San Juan Antiguo and Santurce ) that belonged to the original municipality of San Juan.\\n\nThe 18 barrios are:\\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial times most of the urban population resided in what is today known as Old San Juan . This sector is located on the western half of a small island called the Isleta de San Juan , which is connected to the mainland by two bridges and a causeway . The small island, which comprises an area of 47 square miles (120 km 2 ), also hosts the working-class neighborhood of Puerta de Tierra and most of Puerto Rico\\'s central government buildings, including the Commonwealth\\'s Capitol . This is also the largest and most populated subbarrio of San Juan Antiguo.  \\n\nThe main central part of the old city is characterized by narrow streets made of blue cobblestone and picturesque colonial buildings, some of which date back to the 16th and 17th century. Sections of the old city are surrounded by massive walls and several defensive structures and notable forts. These include the 16th-century Fort San Felipe del Morro and the 17th-century Fort San Cristóbal , both part of San Juan National Historic Site , and the 16th-century El Palacio de Santa Catalina , also known as La Fortaleza , which serves as the governor\\'s mansion.  \\n\nOther buildings of interest predating the 18th century are the Ayuntamiento or Alcaldía ( San Juan City Hall ), the Diputación Provincial and the Real Intendencia buildings, which house the Puerto Rico Department of State ,  the Casa Rosa , the San José Church (1523) and the adjacent Hotel El Convento , the former house of the Ponce de León family known as Casa Blanca , the Teatro Tapia , the former Spanish barracks (now Museum of Ballajá ), La Princesa (former municipal jail, now headquartering the Puerto Rico Tourism Company ), and the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery , located just outside the city walls.    The Cathedral of San Juan Bautista (construction began in the 1520s) is also located in Old San Juan and contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer and settlement founder Juan Ponce de León .  Old San Juan, also known as the \"old city\", is the main cultural tourist attraction in Puerto Rico; its bayside is lined by dock slips for large cruise ships .\\n\nSanturce is the largest and most populated barrio in the municipality of San Juan, and one of the most densely populated areas of the island (13,257.4 persons per square mile).  Santurce, originally named San Mateo de Cangrejos (Saint Matthew of the Crabs), was a settlement for freed African slaves during the early days of the city. After Pablo Ubarri Capetillo, a Spanish railroad developer and Count of San José de Santurce under the Spanish colonial period, sought permission to link San Juan with Río Piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878, the time it took to travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization and growth of the district. At the beginning of the twentieth century an electric trolley was installed, the township was split into three parts, and its main settlement, merged with the city, was renamed using the Spanish spelling of Santurtzi ( Saint George in Basque), Ubarri\\'s birthplace in Vizcaya , Spain. The \"Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico\" ( Puerto Rico Museum of Art )  and other important cultural venues are located in Santurce.\\n\nThis barrio is further divided into subbarrios such as the tourist-oriented neighborhood of Condado , which occupies land that used to be owned by Ubarri Capetillo. Beaches such as nearby Ocean Park , popular with swimmers, surfers and kitesurfers , are found all along the district\\'s Atlantic coastline which is also the locus of numerous hotels.  Miramar is mainly a residential area rising south of the Condado Lagoon. It comprises the former barrio of Miraflores, as well as drained marshland and landfill over which was built San Juan\\'s first airport, the Isla Grande airport, which was renamed Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport in honor of Major Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci (USAF). Miramar now hosts the Puerto Rico Convention Center as well as some of San Juan Harbor\\'s cruise ship piers. In 2005 Miramar was designated an historical district of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nSouth of Santurce is Hato Rey , part of the former municipality of Río Piedras. Hato Rey was grazing ground for cattle owned by the royal government (hence its name, the King\\'s Herd in Spanish) as early as the 16th century,  and is now considered the financial center of the island. A section of this district is often referred to as Milla de Oro (actually 0.47 miles or 0.76 kilometers long) due in part to the many banks and businesses located there.  \\n\nIn the southern part of the city is the socially diversified community of Río Piedras . Founded in the mid-1850s, Río Piedras was a separate town which hosted sugar cane plantations and the estates of some of San Juan\\'s wealthiest inhabitants (as well as their working-class staff). The Spanish colonial governors also had their summer home there on land which eventually gave way to the main campus of the University of Puerto Rico . In 1951 the municipalities of San Juan and Río Piedras were merged to redefine San Juan\\'s current city limits. Today Río Piedras comprises the largest area of the municipality of San Juan.  and is home to the \"Plaza del Mercado\" (Río Piedras Marketplace ), the main campus and the Medical Sciences campus of the University of Puerto Rico and the San Juan Botanical Garden .\\n\nDemographics\nThe municipality of San Juan has a population of 342,259 as of the 2020 US Census, making it the largest in Puerto Rico ,  and the 57th largest in the United States and its territories .  From 1899 to 1950 the municipality of San Juan excluded the township of Río Piedras. For this reason, population data and land area for the period make reference only to the Antiguo San Juan and Santurce barrios , or subdivisions, of San Juan. The old municipality of Río Piedras constituted the third most populated city of Puerto Rico at the time of its annexation in 1951. Its strategic location south of the capital served as a junction for all the principal ways of transportation of the island and as a geographical entry to San Juan, which are factors that prompted Río Piedras\\'s dramatic urban development in the 20th century.  \\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census , the racial composition of San Juan was as follows:\\n\nAmong the Hispanic and Latino population, Puerto Ricans are the largest group; they make up 87.5% of San Juan\\'s Hispanic population. People of Dominican descent make up 7.6% of the Hispanic population, while those of Cuban descent form 1.7% of the Hispanic populace. Other Hispanic and Latino groups collectively form 3.2% of San Juan\\'s Hispanic population.\\n\nThere are 4,822 whites and 1,187 blacks of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan. Non-Hispanic whites and blacks form 1.2% and 0.3% of San Juan\\'s population respectively. There are also approximately 673 Asians of non-Hispanic origin in San Juan; they make up less than 0.1% of the population. However, Asians of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin together number at 6,342.  \\n\nThe vast majority of Asians in San Juan are of Chinese descent; of the 6,342 Asians, 4,928 are Chinese. Chinese comprise 1.4% of the population. The only other sizable Asian group in San Juan are Indian Americans ; there are 698 people of Indian descent in the city, forming 0.2% of the population. There are very small numbers of people of Filipino , Japanese , and Vietnamese ancestry; none of these groups number more than 100 members.  \\n\nAccording to the 2006-2008 American Community Survey, 87.5% of San Juan\\'s population was native and 12.5% were foreign-born. Of the native population, 86.9% were born in Puerto Rico or the U.S. proper, of which 75.6% were born in Puerto Rico and 8.9% were born in the U.S. The other 0.7% were born in a different U.S. territory or born abroad to American parents. The remaining 11.9% of the population were born outside the United States and U.S. territories.\\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of Americans not of Hispanic ancestry (both of African American and of White American descent) have moved to San Juan. In addition, a large number of Stateside Puerto Ricans have settled in the city upon their return to Puerto Rico. There is also a growing West Indian population, both of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin.\\n\nSan Juan today is home to the largest Jewish community in Puerto Rico , and one of the largest Jewish communities in the Caribbean,  with more than 2,000 people attending two local synagogues in Santurce (the Conservative Shaare Zedeck Synagogue and the Reform Temple Beth Shalom)  and an additional synagogue (the Chabad Jewish Center of Puerto Rico) in Isla Verde in neighboring Carolina .  \\n\nIn terms of ancestry, 23,875 people claimed American ancestry, which is equivalent to 5.8% of San Juan\\'s population. Other sizable ancestry groups included those of Italian descent, French descent, and West Indian descent. People of Italian descent numbered at 1,694, forming 0.4% of the population; people of French descent numbered at 1,064, forming 0.2% of the population. Finally, those of West Indian descent numbered at 1,393, forming 0.3% of San Juan\\'s population. Approximately 1,026 people claimed Sub-Saharan African ancestry; 719 claimed Irish ancestry; 646 claimed German ancestry; 431 claimed Arab ancestry, and 346 claimed English ancestry. There are many other ancestry groups in San Juan, but they are very scant.  \\n\nAs of 2000, speakers of English as a first language accounted for 12.93% of the population.  \\n\nEconomy\nSan Juan experienced significant economic growth following World War II . During this period the city underwent an industrial revolution, although as of 1984 it had never generated its own economic region.   The city\\'s economy relies mostly on companies dedicated to the manufacture of several products, including: chemical substances (bleach and house cleaning products); pharmaceuticals; rum and other beverages; fertilizers ; electric tools; electronic devices ; plastics, textiles , and food-based products.  \\n\nTourism is also a key industry, based on San Juan\\'s proximity to Puerto Rico\\'s main airport, the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport .  \\nThe tourism focus of the city is located in the district of Condado Beach where there are luxurious hotels.  Historical locations such as El Morro, Old San Juan and El Cuartel de Ballaja are promoted in tourism campaigns. The district of Hato Rey contains a corporate sector known as Milla de Oro (Golden Mile) which serves as the headquarters of local and international banks. San Juan\\'s Hato Rey district is often referred to as the \"Wall Street of the Caribbean\", due to the influence of the area on Puerto Rico and the Caribbean\\'s economy.  \\n\nSan Juan is also home to the Popular, Inc. , parent company of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico , Popular Bank, E-Loan , and a Fortune 1000 company as of 2022.  Other companies based in San Juan include ATH Network , First BanCorp , Liberty Puerto Rico , The Cervantes Group , and Triple-S Management Corporation . Seaborne Airlines is headquartered on the ninth floor of the World Plaza Building in Hato Rey.  \\n\nTechnological advances after World War II in the development of the airliner, coupled with the island\\'s climate and natural setting, have transformed San Juan into the springboard for tourism around the island, and has made the rest of the Caribbean known throughout the world during the last fifty years.  Today the capital features hotels, museums, historical buildings, restaurants, parks, beaches and shopping centers.\\n\nOld San Juan is often emphasized in tourism campaigns, promoting the historic nature of its colonial buildings and narrow streets covered by cobblestones, a blue stone cast from furnace slag; they were brought over as ballast on Spanish ships.  This includes the city\\'s ancient defensive wall and forts, most notably El Morro and the Castillo San Cristóbal .  On January 23, 1984, both of these edifices together with La Fortaleza and El Cañuelo (in nearby Toa Baja ) were included as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ,  catalogued as being part of humanity\\'s cultural patrimony as part of the National Park Service -administered San Juan National Historic Site .  The restaurants and art galleries in the zone are visited by tourists and locals alike.  \\n\nOutside of Old San Juan, the Puerto Rico Convention Center District (PRCC) includes the Puerto Rico Convention Center , which hosts a number of local and international events throughout the year such as the Puerto Rico Comic Con , the biggest of its kind in the Caribbean.  The PRCC District also hosts a number of hotels, nightclubs, shops, cinemas, bars and restaurants,  the Coca-Cola Music Hall , and the Toro Verde Eco Adventure Park.  \\n\nOther notable tourist attractions in San Juan include the Condado and Ocean Park Beaches , El Escambrón and the Fortín de San Gerónimo , La Placita de Santurce , the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center , the Luis Muñoz Marín and Luis Muñoz Rivera Parks , Plaza Las Américas , The Outlets at Montehiedra , Señorial Plaza , and The Mall of San Juan , the Museum of Art of Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art , the San Juan Wildlife Museum , and the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden , among others. The University of Puerto Rico\\'s main campus in Río Piedras is also of interest with its historic quadrangle and clock tower , its number of theaters and venues which host events such as the Casals Festivals , and a museum. San Juan is also used by tourists as a base to explore other attractions within and outside the San Juan metropolitan area, such as the Bacardi Cathedral of Rum and boardwalk in Cataño , the \"Pork Highway\" of Guavate in Cayey , the bioluminiscent bay in Fajardo , the beaches and street food of Piñones in Loíza , and El Yunque National Forest recreational areas in the municipalities of Luquillo and Río Grande .    \\n\nAn April 2019 report indicated that, by that time, repairs after Hurricane Maria were moving rapidly. Only a few hotels were still closed in San Juan and that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal.  By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up 10% of Puerto Rico\\'s GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.  \\n\nIn late November 2019, reports indicated that 90 calls to San Juan by Royal Caribbean ships would be cancelled during 2020 and 2021. This step would mean 360,000 fewer visitors, with a loss to the island\\'s economy of $44 million. As well, 30 ship departures from San Juan were being canceled.  \\n\nArts and culture\nSan Juan is the birthplace of artists and musicians who have significantly influenced Puerto Rican culture. During the 20th century, the musical aspect of the city was influenced by performers including Afro-Caribbean dancer and choreographer Sylvia del Villard and José Enrique Pedreira who became a composer of Puerto Rican Danzas . International musicians such as opera singer Justino Díaz and Grammy Award winners Ramón Ayala (Daddy Yankee) and Ricky Martin were born in the city. Other notable residents include writers Giannina Braschi and Tomas Blanco , award-winning actors Raul Julia and Benicio del Toro , and comedian José Miguel Agrelot . Teacher Rafael Cordero (1790-1868), was influential in the development of Puerto Rican education and began the process of beatification in 2013, if accepted as a saint he will become only the second black saint from the Americas.  \\n\nThe Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center  hosts some of the most important musical and artistic events in Puerto Rico. It is home to the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra (PRSO) and hosts the Casals Festival , the most important classical music festival in the Caribbean. The venue also hosts theater and musical performances such as Hamilton , which it hosted in 2019.  The Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico is a public music conservatory that hosts Puerto Rican and international students has a longstanding relationship with the classical music movement in the island. The Ateneo Puertorriqueño and the theater of the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras also host important music events.\\n\nThe city is also the home of contemporary and classic art museums. The Puerto Rico Museum of Art hosts the largest collection of art in Puerto Rico, housing over 1,100 permanent art pieces and displaying temporary exhibitions containing artwork from various locations through Latin America.  The Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art , located in Santurce, specializes in contemporary artwork from Latin America and the Caribbean. The paintings displayed in the permanent exhibition are either acquired by the museum\\'s administrative personnel or donated by artists and collectors. They are judged by a panel of painters, art critics, and scholars before being displayed.  \\n\nOther museums such as the Pablo Casals Museum , the San Juan Book Museum, the Museum of the Americas , and the National Gallery display historic items and artwork alongside contemporary art.   Miscellaneous museums such as the Children\\'s Museum, the San Juan Wildlife Museum , and the Bacardi Distillery (also known as the \"Rum Cathedral\") in nearby Cataño appeal to different audiences through interactive exhibitions.   \\n\nThe Casa Dra. Concha Melendez Ramirez in Santurce is a National Historic Landmark and museum and research center that showcases the life and work of one of the most important figures in the literary culture of Puerto Rico.  Old San Juan is also home to important art museums, such as the Puerto Rico National Gallery , and numerous private art galleries.\\n\nGovernment\nAs one of Puerto Rico\\'s 78 municipalities , San Juan\\'s government consists of two branches, the executive and the legislative. Those citizens eligible to vote directly elect the Mayor of San Juan and the municipal assembly for four-year terms. The municipal government is housed in City Hall or Casa Alcaldia , which is located at 153 San Francisco Street, facing the Plaza de Armas at the center of Old San Juan .  City Hall was constructed based on Madrid \\'s City Hall starting in 1604 and finally completed in 1789.  \\n\nThe executive branch is headed by a popularly elected mayor. The office is held by Miguel Romero Lugo who won in the 2020 general election .  Miguel Romero Lugo took over from Carmen Yulín Cruz , who was elected at the 2012 general election . Before her, Jorge A. Santini held the position for 12 years. In addition to running the city\\'s day-to-day operations and supervising associated departments, the mayor is responsible for appointing a secretary-auditor and a treasurer. San Juan\\'s Municipal Legislature is made up of 17 municipal legislators, elected at-large, which represent the city\\'s population.  \\n\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nOn March 8, 1948, the city government of San Juan officially adopted as the city\\'s first flag an orange field, in the center of which is the coat of arms of the city. The orange color was based and taken from Father Diego de Torres Vargas \\' text and it reads:\\n\n\" Escudo de armas dado a Puerto Rico por los Reyes Católicos en el año de 1511, siendo Procurador un vecino llamado Pedro Moreno. Son : un cordero blanco con su banderilla colorada, sobre un libro, y todo sobre una isla verde, que es la de Puerto Rico, y por los lados una F y una I, que quiere decir Fernando e Isabel, los Reyes Católicos que se las dieron, y hoy se conservan en el estandarte real, que es de damasco anaranjado, con que se ganó la ciudad \".  \\n\n(\"Coat of arms given to Puerto Rico by the Catholic Monarchs in the year 1511 being Procurator a vecino (citizen) named Pedro Moreno. They are a white lamb with a red flag, on top of a book, and everything above a green island, which is Puerto Rico...which is of orange damask, with which the city was won\"). It appears that the color was changed from orange to white at some point.   \\n\nSan Juan is the territorial capital of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , and it is home to the executive , legislative and judicial branches of the Puerto Rican government . San Juan is also the seat of the Puerto Rico Senatorial district I , which is represented by two Senators.  The United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is located in Hato Rey . There are two additional federal offices in the San Juan metropolitan area: the Jose V. Toledo U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Old San Juan and the GSA Federal Center in Guaynabo.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), along with other federal organisms, has also had regional offices at the Federico Degetau Federal Building also in Hato Rey.  \\n\nLaw enforcement in San Juan is the joint responsibility of the Department of Police and Public Safety, also known as the San Juan Police Department and the Puerto Rico Police Department .  The Municipal Police, originally known as the \"San Juan Municipal Guard\", was created in 1521 and had active military and law enforcement functions until 1980, when Act #77 created municipal law enforcement agencies in Puerto Rico. It employs over 1,000 sworn officers plus civilian staff.  \\n\nIn 2010 there were 201 homicides in San Juan, a rate of around 50 per 100,000 residents. In 2019 they were 172 homicides a rate of 53 per 100,000 residents.  In the 2019 bulletin ranking of the 50 most violent cities in the world San Juan ranked as the 16th most violent in the world with a rate of 54.01 murders per 100,000 inhabitants,  and the 3rd most violent in the United States and its territories after St. Louis and Baltimore .  \\n\nMedia\nMost of Puerto Rico\\'s major newspapers are published in San Juan: El Nuevo Día , Primera Hora , El Vocero and the English-language San Juan Star .

Most of the specialized schools operated by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are located in San Juan. These schools emphasize topics such as Science and Math, Radio and Television, Arts, Trade, Music, and Sports, but also include other subjects such as Spanish, English, and Social Studies in their curriculum.\\n\nIn addition to dozens of state-run elementary, intermediate, and high schools, the government of the city of San Juan operates two bilingual schools, including one sports-magnet school, the first municipal-run schools in Puerto Rico.  Several private schools are located in San Juan, including Robinson and St. John\\'s schools in the Condado , Perpetuo Socorro in Miramar , St. John\\'s Episcopal, Santa Mónica and Academia San Jorge in Santurce , Commonwealth High School, La Merced and Espíritu Santo in Hato Rey , Escuela Josefita Monserrate de Selles, San Antonio, Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola , San José in Río Piedras and Cupeyville , St. Mary\\'s, Boneville and Cupey Maria Montesory School in Cupey.\\n\nTransportation\nThe San Juan Metropolitan Area is served by two airports:\\n\nThe Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU), San Juan\\'s primary commercial airport, is located eight miles (12.9 km) from Old San Juan in the neighboring municipality of Carolina . The airport accommodates more than 30 domestic and international airlines and is the busiest airport in the Caribbean . It is often referred to as The Gateway to the Caribbean because it serves as the main connection to the island and the rest of the Caribbean for the United States and vice versa.  \\n\nThe area\\'s secondary airport is the Fernando Ribas Dominicci Airport (SIG), located directly across the San Antonio Channel ( Caño San Antonio ) from Old San Juan in the Isla Grande district.  Dominicci Airport is used mainly by general aviation aircraft, charter flights and some domestic commercial flights. It used to be the city\\'s and also the island of Puerto Rico\\'s main international gateway until the opening of Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport. It is now also widely used by the Isla Grande Flight School and Caribbean Flight Center, the only flight school on the island.\\n\nSome of the major highways and roads of San Juan include:\\n\nThere are 193 bridges in San Juan.  \\n\nAt 4,300 vehicles per paved mile, San Juan has by far the highest density of vehicles on the road of any city in the world.  The city is served by five limited-access expressways and highways and numerous arterial avenues and boulevards but continues to suffer from severe traffic congestion.  \\n\nThe Metropolitan Bus Authority ( Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses or AMA in Spanish) provides daily bus transportation to residents of San Juan, Guaynabo, Bayamón, Toa Baja, Trujillo Alto, Cataño and Carolina through 30 fixed routes. Its fleet consists of 277 regular buses and 35 handicap-accessible buses. AMA\\'s ridership is estimated at 112,000 on weekdays.  \\n\nIn an attempt to decrease vehicle dependency and road congestion, the city built a metro system dubbed \" Tren Urbano \" (\"Urban Train\"). The 10.7-mile (17.2 km) line connects to 16 stations.  The project, which opened in late 2004, cost $2.25 billion and was more than $1 billion over budget and four years late. The Tren Urbano has received less ridership than was originally projected and has not significantly reduced the city\\'s automobile traffic, despite a reported 7.5% ridership increase in 2006 over 2005. There is a planned project to build an \"interurban light rail system\" connecting the cities of San Juan and Caguas .  \\n\nIncreased investment in public transportation, however, has not changed the fact that San Juan is an automobile-reliant city and its fast growth has sparked urban sprawl . As of mid-2010, the government has approved plans for a redesign of this Puerto Rican city, featuring a new mass transit system, new roads and intersections, and more beach-access points. No cars will be allowed inside the oldest part of city (Old San Juan). The plans hope to remedy previous poor urban planning in the oldest section of the city, the Isleta, while curbing reliance on motor vehicles. The plans for redevelopment also hope to make the city more appealing in order to attract new residents, as San Juan has suffered from a shrinking population over the past 60 years.  \\n\nThe Port of San Juan is the fourth busiest seaport in the Western Hemisphere, ranked among the top 17 in the world in terms of container movement. It is also the largest home-based cruise port in the world with over a dozen cruise ships. It is the second busiest port in cruise volume after Miami. [ citation needed ] It is managed by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority .\\n\nAcuaExpreso is a ferry service in the San Juan Bay , consisting of the Cataño Ferry ( Lancha de Cataño ) service between downtown Cataño and Old San Juan , and the AquaExpress which connects Old San Juan to Hato Rey and the Tren Urbano .   \\n\nHealthcare\nSan Juan has an elaborate system of triage , hospital, and preventive care health services. The municipal government sponsors regular health fairs in different areas of the city focusing on health care for the elderly and the disabled. There are 20 hospitals in San Juan, half of them operated by the government. The largest hospital in San Juan and most important of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean [ citation needed ] is the Rio Piedras Medical Center , or Centro Medico de Rio Piedras in Spanish. This hospital, founded in 1956, is operated by the Medical Services Administration of the Department of Health of Puerto Rico. It is made up of eight other hospitals.\\n\nThe city of San Juan operates 10 hospitals. Of these, nine are Diagnostic and Treatment Centers located in communities throughout San Juan. The main hospital is located at Centro Medico. These 10 hospitals are:\\n\nAlso, there are 10 private hospitals in San Juan. These are:\\n\nSports\nTeams based in San Juan have been notably successful in athletic competition.

San Sebastián is spread over twenty-four barrios and San Sebastián Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nThe permission to found the town was officially granted in 1752, under the leadship of the founder, Captain Cristóbal González de la Cruz , who among other residents had an interest in converting some cow farms into an agricultural village. The foundation of the town from the religious aspect, was consummated in December 1762 by Mariano Martin, the island catholic bishop at that time. At the beginning, by 1700, San Sebastián was a conglomerate of a few cow farms, owned by some residents of the Partido de Aguada. Las Vegas was the former plain site of one of the first cow farms located by the Guatemala riverside at the north. Also, another of those cow farms was Pepinito (today\\'s downtown ) that was a prominent hill with a white calcium carbonate face. On the north side of the town it can be seen some of this pepinos ( cucumbers ). These two cow farms gave the town its first name. From these geographical features come the first names of the new village: Las Vegas del Pepino (Cucumber Fields). In 1865 it is documented as San Sebastián de Las Vegas del Pepino .\\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, wealthy Spanish families arrived in El Pepino, fleeing the revolutions of Venezuela and the Dominican Republic . Later, by 1850, several families from Catalonia and the Basque Country in Spain joined the large number of isleños ( Canary Islanders ) that had made El Pepino their home. These people, after taking over the local political power, developed a coffee industry and brought some material progress to the town. Basques in the municipality, in remembrance of their home region and its religious patron, saw the need of updating old traditions used by the Canary Islanders and started to call the town San Sebastián , and thus got the name formally changed by the central government authority. Nevertheless, the citizens of San Sebastián are popularly called pepinianos .\\n\nSan Sebastián Mártir (Spanish for Saint Sebastian the Martyr ) is the patron saint of archers and was chosen to be the patron saint of the town since its early history, first brought by the immigrants from the Canaries and later confirmed by the Basques, with the town name changed in 1869.\\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in San Sebastián with significant amount of rainfall. The hurricane winds knocked all the power out and the town was left in the dark.   \\n\nThe 40,000 residents of San Sebastián were left without electrical power.  \\nTwo weeks after the hurricane decimated the island, Javier Jiménez , the mayor at the time, noticed that help was not on the way. He decided that San Sebastián would not wait for the AEE brigades to come. He assembled an ad hoc team of volunteers, some who were retired AEE electricians, set safety protocols, and their mandate was to get the electrical power back up and running for the people of San Sebastián. \\nFour months after the hurricane, they had restored power to 2,500 homes and continued to do about 60 homes each day.  A monument honoring the accomplishments of the Pepino Power Authority , as they were quickly named, was erected in Plaza de la Identidad Pepiniana in San Sebastián barrio-pueblo .  \\n\nGeography\nSan Sebastián is on the northwest.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, San Sebastián is subdivided into barrios .

Toa Baja is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . Toa Baja is located fifteen minutes by car from San Juan and two hours from Ponce .\\n\nHistory\nThe region of what is now Toa Baja belonged to the Taíno region of Toa and Bayamón, which was located on the north coast of Puerto Rico.  The regions were led by cacique Aramana and Majagua respectively. During the Spanish colonization , a farm was settled in the region around 1511 where Spanish settlers tried to learn from the Taínos how to grow fruits and vegetables. Some of the families who settled in the region were Marrero, Salgado, and Martínez, from the Canary Islands .  \\n\nIn 1745, the town was officially organized, with the parish being built in 1749. It was dedicated to Nuestra Señora de la Concepción ( Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception ). It is said that in 1776 there were six cattle ranches and 12 sugar cane estates in the region. However, rises in the flow of nearby rivers were problematic for the population. Because of this, in 1841 a group of residents requested the settlement to be transferred to what is now Dorado . The municipality of Dorado was officially founded the next year.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Toa Baja was 4,030.\\n\nIn 1902, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved the consolidation of several municipalities, which resulted in the annexation of Toa Baja to the municipality of Bayamón . However, in 1905 the law was annulled, and Toa Baja regained its status as an independent town.  \\n\nIn 2010, Toa Baja was among the top ten municipalities in Puerto Rico, in terms of population, with 89,609 residents.  \\n\nThe La Plata River rose more than 11 feet on September 20, 2017 as a result of Hurricane Maria and caused major infrastructure damage in Toa Baja.  \\n\nThe four radar systems used by the Federal Aviation Administration in Puerto Rico were broken and took almost two weeks to restore. One of the radar systems is located at Punta Salinas in Toa Baja.  \\n\nIn mid 2018, the United States Army Corps of Engineers announced it would be undertaking a major flood control project of the Río de la Plata river, which often causes flooding in Toa Baja.  \\n\nGeography\nToa Baja is located in the Northern Coastal Plains of the island, in the Northern Karst zone. It has an area of 24.0 miles 2 (62.4 km 2 ). The terrain consists mostly of alluvial deposits and clay-like surface as a result of the surrounding waters.   \\n\nThe elevations range from 200 to 490 feet (60 to 150 meters) above sea level, with most of its highest parts located in the south. The rest of the area is mostly plain. The northern part of Toa Baja is characterized for its mangroves and marshes , while the southern part is classified as typical karst area.  \\n\nUpdated flood zone maps (as of 2019) show that Toa Baja is extremely vulnerable to flooding, along with Humacao , Rincón , Barceloneta , and Corozal . For its many rivers, almost the entire municipality of Toa Baja is in the flood zone area.  Homes in Toa Baja have historically been built a few feet above ground level to account for flooding. After Hurricane Maria , architects from the University of Puerto Rico and Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico provided residents of Toa Baja with ideas on how to mitigate flooding.  \\n\nThere are three main rivers in Toa Baja: Río de la Plata , Río Cocal , and Río Hondo . La Plata is the longest river on the island and crosses Toa Baja in the east. Cocal is the natural boundary between Toa Baja and Dorado. Boca Vieja Bay  is a bay located in Toa Baja.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Toa Baja is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nAlthough not a barrio, Levittown is the most populated community in the municipality of Toa Baja.  \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Toa Baja: Sector Villa Hostos (Campanillas), San José, Sector El 26, Toa Ville, Villa Albizu in Candelaria, Villa Calma, Villa del Sol, Villa Esperanza, Villa Marisol, and Villa Quintero.   \\n\nIn 2009, an order was given by Governor Luis G. Fortuño to shut off essential services, such as water and electricity, to Villas del Sol, a \"Special Community\", which consisted of homes built illegally on flood-prone, state land. The Federal Emergency Management Agency bought these homes from the Puerto Rican government in order to keep the land from being used further. In January 2010, the Puerto Rican government began demolishing some of the homes. The village had a large population of Dominicans, including illegal aliens. In 2013, the mayor and the community continued to argue about how to construct in Villas del Sol.  By 2016, six years after the community had been promised, by the government of Toa Baja, that it would receive permits for the building of critical infrastructure, it had not.  Some families had dispersed, others had constructed humble homes on land obtained from a private donor.  \\n\nDemographics\nIn 2020, Toa Baja had a population of 75,293. This represents a decrease of 16% since 2010, when the population was 89,609. In 2000, the population was 94,085. The population in Toa Baja had steadily increased from 1899, when it had 4,030.   \\n\nTourism\nThere are 22 beaches in Toa Baja.  \\nSome main attractions of Toa Baja include:\\n\nCulture\nToa Baja celebrates its patron saint festival in June. The Fiestas Patronales de San Pedro Apostol is a religious and cultural celebration in honor of Saint Peter and generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.    \\n\nFiestas de la Santa Cruz is celebrated in May with the participation of various churches and cultural groups. It is dedicated to the Holy Cross, and lasts nine nights.\\n\nIn October, the town celebrates the Festival de la Zafra with musical groups of bomba and plena .\\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Toa Baja include:\\n\nToa Baja doesn\\'t have a team in the island\\'s main male sports leagues. They do have a female volleyball team from the Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino , the Llaneras de Toa Baja .   \\n\nEach year, Toa Baja hosts both the Pee Wee Reese World Series (for baseball players of ages 12 and under) and the Willie Mays World Series (for baseball players of ages 10 and under). The town has a team, the Llaneros de Levittown , in the PeeWee Reese Category baseball team from the Pro-Deportes/American Amateur Baseball Congress. [ citation needed ] \\n\nEconomy\nFor many years, Toa Baja\\'s economy relied in agriculture, particularly sugar cane and cattle .  Because of this, the municipality was the site of many important haciendas like Santa Elena (founded in 1790), Central Constancia (founded in 1867), and Media Luna. In the middle of the 18th century, fishing also became a primary source of Toa Baja\\'s economy. Cattle ranches were also among the best in the island, processing large amounts of milk. The growth of small fruits also continues to be one of Toa Baja\\'s main products.  \\n\nAfter the 1950s , manufacturing started replacing agriculture as the main economic source. Currently, the industrial sector continues to be one of the most important factors of economic growth in the region. Some of the products manufactured in Toa Baja are metal, plastic, concrete, textile, electrical and electronic machinery, and rum.\\n\nGovernment\nAnibal Vega Borges , a lawyer, was elected Mayor of the city in 2004 for the first time. He has been re-elected twice (2008 and 2012). Vega Borges\\' election wins have been for wide margins, which led a newspaper to label him as one of the \"most powerful\" mayors in the island.  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district II , which is represented by two Senators. Migdalia Padilla and Carmelo Ríos Santiago have served as District Senators since 2005.  \\n\nIn 2016 Vega Borges was challenged to a primary by a former representative of Toa Baja, Bernardo \"Betito\" Marquez Garcia . Marquez won the primary and subsequently won the general election.  On January 15, 2017 Marquez Garcia was sworn in as mayor of Toa Baja.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nToa Baja\\'s official flag features two vertical bands: the left side is green and the right side is gold. The green band represents the plains of the Toa River (now known as La Plata ), and the golden band represents the sun. The green band features two keys, one across the other. One is gold and the other silver, symbolizing the Apostle Saint Peter , the patron saint of the city.   \\n\nToa Baja\\'s coat of arms features a green waving stripe, representing the Toa River , one of the first mentioned in the history of Puerto Rico. Like the flag, it features two keys, one across the other, symbolizing Saint Peter , patron saint of the town. The coat has the letters \"F\" and \"J\" to each side of the keys, representing Ferdinand II of Aragon and V of Castile , and his daughter, Joanna of Castile , sovereign of Castile and León .  \\n\nThe gold fields above and below the green stripe represent the wealth of the city. It also feature handfuls of yucca , one of the main crops of this area. It constitutes a symbol of the Taínos who cultivated it, and whose main food was cassava or bread of yucca. Two sugar cane stems surround the shield, representing the cultivation and industry of sugar cane , which was the main source of Toa Baja\\'s economy.  \\n\nTransportation\nToa Baja is approximately 25 minutes in non-rush hour from San Juan by car, however, it may take up to 90 minutes in rush hour . The main road to the city is the PR-22 and PR-165 .  \\n\nA new bus rapid transit (BRT) system called Metro Urbano operates in the center of José de Diego Expressway (PR-22) in high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV) from Candelaria in Toa Baja to the Bayamón Station of the Tren Urbano metro system.  \\n\nThere are 29 bridges in Toa Baja.  \\n\nNotable people\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nTrujillo Alto, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nTrujillo Alto  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Northern Coastal Plain, on the boundary between the karst zone and Sierra de Luquillo , north of Caguas , and Gurabo ; southeast of San Juan , and west of Carolina . Trujillo Alto is part of the San Juan Metropolitan Area , which includes the municipalities of Bayamón , Guaynabo , Cataño , and Toa Baja . The city is spread over 6 barrios and Trujillo Alto Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nTrujillo Alto was officially founded in 1801, but gained more importance during the 20th century. Due to its proximity to the capital, San Juan , the city has become a suburb of the metropolitan area, which has sparked its growth during recent years. The population of Trujillo Alto has increased through the last century from 9,576 (1930) to 74,482 (2010). According to the 2010 Census, it is Puerto Rico\\'s tenth-most populated municipality.  \\n\nIn 1953-54, the Carraízo hydroelectric dam was constructed in Trujillo Alto by the Sumner Sollitt Construction Company of Chicago, under contract by the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority . The dam forms the Loíza Lake , a reservoir which serves as the main source of the water supply for San Juan, Puerto Rico .  \\n\nHistory\nThe region of what is now Trujillo Alto belonged to the Taíno region of Cayniabón, which stretched from the northeast coast of Puerto Rico into the central region of the island.  The region was led by cacique Canobaná. Archeological findings have identified two sites within the municipality of Trujillo Alto with archeological significance: Las Cuevas, which was studied by Irving Rouse, and Quebrada Grande.  \\n\nAfter the Spanish colonization , families started settling at both sides of the Río Grande de Loíza . During the 17th century, the Spanish crown granted Alonso Pizarro Hermona, from Trujillo in Spain, a vast ranch that covered the region. Residents began using his family name to refer to the location. Eventually, the inhabitants went to the Governor and asked for a permit to build a chapel, which was a requisite to officially found a town. Despite some opposition, Trujillo Alto was founded on January 8, 1801, under the name of Municipio La Santa Cruz de Trujillo .  The town was settled on a meander of the Río Grande de Loíza . Around 1820, the name Trujillo Alto was used to differentiate the town from that of Trujillo Bajo (which later became known as Carolina ).  \\n\nIn 1826, communication to and from the town improved with the construction of two bridges: one into Río Piedras , and the other into Río Grande . In 1844, Trujillo Alto was composed of only five barrios. A few years later, the first school was built. During that time, its population decreased notably due to an epidemic of cholera .\\n\nIn 1898, when Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain, it became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the US Department of War conducted its first census of Puerto Rico and found that the population of Trujillo Alto was 5,683.  \\n\nIn 1902, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a law for the consolidation of certain municipalities. As a result, Trujillo Alto was incorporated into the town and municipality of bordering Carolina . In 1905 the law was revoked returning Trujillo Alto to its status of municipality again.  \\n\nIn 1952, along with the Carraízo Dam constructed in barrio Carraízo , a filtration plant was constructed in barrio Cuevas in Trujillo Alto.  \\n\nThe proximity of the city to the capital, San Juan , sparked significant growth and development in the region and during the 20th century, the population of Trujillo Alto increased dramatically.  As of 2010, the city is the tenth-most populous city of Puerto Rico . Mayor José Luis Cruz Cruz , who has been serving since 2009, has labeled the city as \" The New Metropolis \".  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Trujillo Alto, with its rain and winds.   The hurricane winds and rain damaged infrastructure and caused almost the entire electrical system of Trujillo Alto to collapse, leaving its nearly 75,000 residents with no electrical power. Also, 90% of the residents lost access to clean, drinking water .  \\n\nGeography\nTrujillo Alto sits on the Northern Coastal Plain region of Puerto Rico. It is bordered by the municipalities of San Juan , Carolina , Gurabo , and Caguas .  Trujillo Alto is a small municipality, covering only 21.47 square miles (55.6 km 2 ).  \\n\nTrujillo Alto\\'s terrain is mostly plain in the north, while the south features small hills. Heights can range from 660 to 1,600 feet (200-500 meters) above sea level.\\n\nTrujillo Alto\\'s hydrographic system consists mainly of the Río Grande de Loíza , which crosses the municipality.  There are also several creeks in the city: Colorada, Infierno, Limones, Naranjo, Grande, Pastrana, Haya Fría, and Maracuto.  \\n\nAlso, Trujillo Alto is the site of Puerto Rico \\'s main water reservoir : The Carraízo Dam , at the Loíza Lake . Both were built in 1953 by the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA). Although it was originally built to generate hydroelectricity, it is now used solely as a public water-supply source.  The Loíza Lake is also used for water sports and recreational fishing.\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Trujillo Alto is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .    \\n\nTrujillo Alto\\'s townscape is fairly simple. Most of the barrios are spread through the rural section of the city, while the downtown area (Trujillo Alto Pueblo) is small, consisting only of eight primary streets. This gave the city the nickname of the \"City of the Eight Streets\".  Also, there are no high-rise buildings and structures.\\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Trujillo Alto: San Nicolás neighborhood, Bethania, Comunidad Talanco, El Hoyo II, El Resbalón, Parcelas Carraízo, Parcelas Ramón T. Colón, Sector Arayanes, Sector La Prá, Sector Las Cruces, Sector Los Nuñez, Villa Escondida, Villa Margarita and Villa Platanal.   \\n\nTourism\nThere are several places of interest for tourists to visit in Trujillo Alto. The Bicentenary Walkway , located in the entrance to the city at the PR-181 , features the remodeled historic steel bridge (one of the first permanent crossings of the Grande de Loiza River ) as well as a gazebo . It was built in 2001 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of Trujillo Alto.\\n\nAlso on the PR-181 , is the Luis Muñoz Marín Foundation which was established in 1980. It includes a museum, a historic archive, and a park.  \\n\nThe Carraízo Dam and the Loíza Lake reservoir are also frequently visited. Other places of interest are the Carmelitas de San José Convent , the Lourdes Grotto , and the Trujillo Alto Mountain Spring .\\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Trujillo Alto has relied mostly on agriculture, particularly sugarcane , coffee, tobacco, and minor fruits. Cattle ranching is also a source of economy in Trujillo Alto. In recent years, commerce and industry have become integral parts of the economy of the city. Trujillo Alto is the site of several factories of nutritional products, wood, metal, electrical machinery, and others. There are also stone quarries in town for the production of building materials.\\n\nAs of 2013, Trujillo Alto\\'s unemployment was 10.2%, making it the second municipality with the lowest rate after Guaynabo .  \\n\nCulture\nTrujillo Alto celebrates its patron saint festival in September. The Fiestas Patronales de Santa Cruz is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nThe Festival Trujillano de Orquídeas ( Orchid Festival) has been held in July since 2011. It is an horticultural competition and festival where orchids are ranked, exhibited and sold.  \\n\nThe Festival del Macabeo (Macabeo Festival), a festival celebrating a food specific to Trujillo Alto, is celebrated each year around the second week of December.  \\n\nOther festivals and fairs celebrated in Trujillo Alto include an agricultural fair held in January and a Paso Fino Festival held in November.\\n\nIn 2001, Trujillo Alto commemorated its bicentenary with the opening of a new park in the PR-181 , which included a remodeling of the historical steel bridge.\\n\nThere are a number of churches and chapels from several denominations in Trujillo Alto. The main parish, Santa Cruz Church, was built in 1817. Part of a related structure was damaged by Hurricane San Felipe in 1928.   The current structure was designed by Luis Perocier and built in 1933.  \\n\nTrujillo Alto has also been a place of pilgrimage for Catholics after a shrine to Our Lady of Lourdes was blessed in 1925. The site also features a grotto dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes. The Lourdes grotto is visited frequently by religious people and tourists.  There\\'s also a convent in Trujillo Alto called the Convento Carmelitas de San José .\\n\nTrujillo Alto doesn\\'t have a professional sports team.

The construction of two bridges in 1826 helped facilitate access to the town. In 1939, the United States Army built a steel bridge in the entrance to the town on the PR-181, to replace one of the older ones. Although the bridge is no longer used for vehicles, it has become a symbol of the city and still stands today.  \\n\nThe northern part of Trujillo Alto is serviced by the Puerto Rico Metropolitan Bus Authority , with various stops along the PR-181 and nearby neighborhoods.

        "page_content": "Contents\nUtuado, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nUtuado  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the central mountainous region of the island known as the Cordillera Central . It is located north of Adjuntas and Ponce ; south of Hatillo and Arecibo ; east of Lares ; and west of Ciales and Jayuya . It is the third-largest municipality in land area in Puerto Rico (after Arecibo and Ponce ). According to the 2020 US Census , the municipality has a population of 28,287 spread over 24 barrios and Utuado pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city).\\n\nUtuado is the main municipality of the Utuado micropolitan statistical area and is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area .\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Utuado derives from the Taíno word otoao , meaning roughly between mountains (i.e., a valley). The letters \"o\" and \"u\" are often variable in Taíno. The \"d\" originated as a hypercorrection : colloquial Spanish often reduces /a\\xc3\\xb0o/ to /ao/, so an un-etymological \"d\" was added to the Taíno name.\\n\nThe municipality is known as Ciudad del Viví (Viví City), derived from the Viví River which runs through Utuado: one river branch comes from Adjuntas and the other from Jayuya . These two rivers then meet near the Fernando L. Ribas Dominicci Avenue and continue the journey to Lago Dos Bocas .\\n\nHistory\nThe town of Utuado was founded October 12, 1739, by Irishman Sebastian de Morfi ( Sebastian Murphy ), on behalf of 60 families from Arecibo .  It was the first town established in the interior, mountainous region of the island known as Cordillera Central and the 11th oldest established municipality in Puerto Rico, following San Juan , San Germán , Coamo , Arecibo , Aguada , Loiza , Ponce , Añasco , Guayama and Manatí .\\n\nAt the time of the Spanish initial occupation of the island on November 19, 1493, by Christopher Columbus , Puerto Rico was inhabited by the Taíno . The Taínos were a culturally developed society with a universal language , a developed agricultural system, and a social organization based on caciques or chieftains . The Utuado area was ruled over by cacique Guarionex. In Caguana , the Taínos built a series of courts or bateyes , Caguana Ceremonial Ball Courts Site , the most extensive example of Taino engineering in the West Indies .  The site is designated a US National Historic Landmark.  \\n\nFrom 1510 through 1513, the island witnessed a Taíno rebellion as a result of harsh and inhumane treatment by the Spanish settlers . During the process of pacification many Spaniards settled in the area now occupied by the municipality of Utuado and set up farms ( haciendas ), initially on behalf of the Spanish government ( Hacienda Real Dos ), to provide food for the Indian slaves working the gold mines and the Spanish colonists in the area. One of the first settlers in the Otoao region in 1512 was Antonio Sedeño , the island\\'s bookkeeper . His farm\\'s main crop was yuca . His farm was sold in 1519 to Blas de Villasante , the island\\'s treasurer, for 525 gold pesos .\\n\nAreas in the Utuado region that were exploited for gold include Salto Arriba barrio, initially, then later in the 1530s Caguana barrio and Don Alonso barrio. In the 1530s, landowners in the Don Alonso area petitioned the Spanish Crown allow for the establishment of a town in the area but it was never granted.\\n\nOnce the gold mining era ended toward the end of the 16th century, very little is known about the Utuado region until the early 18th century. According to the Puerto Rican historian Fernando Picó , the few documents that exist indicate the area was mostly unpopulated and densely forested . On the other hand, he states that Utuado is the municipality with the most caves, that most likely served as dwellings for Indians or runaway slaves.\\n\nThe agreement to establish the town of Utuado by the 60 families of Arecibo states they purchased the Hato de Otoao for 569 pesos and 5 reales from owners Manuel Natal and Felipa Román. It also states their desire to choose where on the land the town center would be located, which indicates the area was not populated yet.\\n\nDuring his visit to the island in 1771, Fray Iñigo Abbad y Lasierra states the principal economic activity in the Utuado region was cattle raising , horses and mules . He mentions a small amount of agricultural activity existed but the population only produced enough tobacco and coffee for their own consumption.\\n\nDuring the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Utuado\\'s population continued to grow as coffee gained in importance and growers saw the need for high altitudes and mountainous terrain to produce the best coffee beans . People not only migrated from the Puerto Rican coastal towns but also from Ireland (founder Sebastian de Morfi was Irish), the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands of Majorca and Menorca , all seeking the riches that coffee had to offer.\\n\nDuring the late 19th century Utuado experienced an explosive economic growth centered around the cultivation of coffee, also known at the time as oro negro or \"black gold\". By the 1890s Utuado was the largest producer of coffee in Puerto Rico and the second municipality (after Ponce ) with the largest population. It produced a rich social life for many of its citizens and a casino and theatre were established in the town. The progress of the town was so evident that the regent Queen of Spain, María Cristina , honored the town with the title of Ciudad (City) on August 20, 1894.  In 1896 or 1897 Utuado was the first city in Puerto Rico with a public electric lighting system powered by a hydraulic turbine power plant ,   and in that same year mayor Juan Casellas planned a train system to connect Utuado with Arecibo. By 1899 this golden era ended due to two events: the United States occupation of the island in 1898 , which made sugar the new crop of importance instead of coffee (Utuado\\'s mountainous landscape was not ideal for growing sugarcane , making it impossible for it to compete in the sugar industry), and Hurricane San Ciriaco in 1899, which destroyed the coffee haciendas .\\n\nUtuado was the first municipality to elect officials after Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States.  \\n\nOne of the most tragic moments in Utuado\\'s history occurred on October 30, 1950, during the Utuado uprising against United States rule, which culminated in what is known as the Utuado Massacre .  In Utuado, a group of 32 nationalists, led by nationalist leaders Heriberto Castro and Damián Torres, fought against the local police during the independence revolts which occurred in various cities and towns of the island. The group was reduced to 12 men and retreated to Damián Torres\\' house. Torres\\' residence was attacked by 50-caliber machine-gun fire from ten American P-47 Thunderbolt planes.  The National Guard arrived later that day and ordered the nine men who survived the attack to surrender. Once the nationalists surrendered, they were forced to march down Dr. Cueto Street to the main town square where their shoes, belts and personal belongings were removed. The group was then taken behind the police station where they were gunned down. Five of the nationalists died in the act, these were nationalist leader Heriberto Castro, Julio Colón Feliciano, Agustín Quiñones Mercado, Antonio Ramos and Antonio González. González, who was 17 years old, pleaded for water and instead was bayoneted to death.  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Utuado. In many areas of Utuado there were more than 25 landslides per square mile due to the intense rainfall from Hurricane Maria.    \\n\nGeography\nUtuado is in the central mountainous region.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Utuado is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Utuado: Altos de Arena, \\nSector El Guano in Arenas Abajo, \\nSector Las Cuevas in Viví Abajo, \\nSector Mina de Oro in \\xc3\\x81ngeles Poblado, \\nSector Jácanas in Caguana, \\nMameyes, \\nCaniaco, \\nCayuco, \\nChorreras, \\nDon Alonso Motor, \\nEl Ensanche, \\nEl Hoyo in Mameyes, \\nJudea, \\nLa Granja, \\nLa Playita, \\nLoma Maestre, \\nLomas Colón (Colón neighborhood),\\nLos Pinos, \\nMatadero Viejo, \\nNuevo Londres, \\nSector (Calle) San Antonio, \\nSector Cuba, \\nSector (Calle) Borinquén, \\nTetuán III , and Calle Progreso in barrio-pueblo .   \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nWith narrow streets leading up to a central plaza surrounded by a church and the governor\\'s house, Utuado Pueblo is an example of a town built during the Spanish colonial era of Puerto Rico. The Iglesia San Miguel Arcangel , the local Catholic parish, was founded in 1746. The current double-steepled church was built between 1872 and 1878 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places , along with the Caguana Ceremonial Park and the Blanco Bridge or Puente Blanco located in Arenas barrio which connects Utuado with Adjuntas . Other buildings in Utuado Pueblo that retain their colonial architectural features include The Center for Art, Culture and Tourism in the old Tobacco Coop building, the old hospital Hospital Catalina Figueras and Teatro San Miguel , among others.\\n\nThe Rio Abajo State Forest ( Bosque Estatal Rio Abajo ) is a 5,780-acre (23 km 2 ) forest reserve shared with Arecibo and home to 223 plants and wildlife species including: native ceiba ( Ceiba pentandra ), Asian teaks ( Tectona spp.), West Indian mahogany ( Swietenia mahagoni ), Honduran mahogany ( S. humilis ) and Australian pines ( Casuarina spp.). It is also home to the federally endangered Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk ( Buteo platypterus brunnescens ) as well as a captive population of the critically endangered Puerto Rican parrot ( Amazona vittata ). Captive parrots are slowly being released into Río Abajo in an attempt to form a second population of parrots on the island.\\n\nEast of the Rio Abajo Forest Reserve is the Dos Bocas Lake and dam, one of several man-made lakes in Utuado. From El Embarcadero , near routes 123 and 146, boats take guests around the water to one of the many restaurants for lakeside dining.\\n\nThe Caonillas Lake and dam in the western region of Utuado is another man-made lake. This reservoir encompasses over 50 square miles (130 km 2 ) and was constructed in 1948 by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority .\\n\nEconomy\nUtuado has regained some of its coffee producing power and was the 3rd largest coffee producer in Puerto Rico in the 2002 USDA Agricultural Census. It also produces oranges (ranked 4th), plantains (ranked 6th) and bananas (ranked 9th). It has been successful with livestock inventory ranking 3rd with hives of bees and 13th with pigs. In terms of manufacturing, Utuado has facilities producing textiles , paper and stone.\\n\nUtuado today is equipped with a modern and competitive telecommunications infrastructure. Major cell phone companies including Claro and AT&T offer mobile coverage. Liberty Cablevision and DirecTV offer cable and satellite television service, with Spanish and English channels as well as high-speed Internet service.\\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Utuado is administered by a mayor. Jorge \"Jorgito\" Pérez Heredia ( NPP ) took office as mayor of Utuado on January 16, 2021, succeeding Ernesto Irizarry Salvá ( PDP ) after an 8-year term. Utuado belongs to Representative District 22, which is represented by one Representative. In 2020, Jorge Alfredo Rivera Segarra was elected as District Representative.  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Ramón Ruiz and Martín Vargas Morales (both PDP ), were elected as District Senators.  \\nIn 2020, Marially González ( PDP ) succeeded Vargas Morales for her first term as District Senator, while Ramón Ruiz was elected to his second.  \\n\nCulture\nThe Montañeses de Utuado ( Utuado Mountaineers ) are a semi-professional baseball team based in Utuado that competes in the Puerto Rico Amateur Baseball Federation \\'s Liga Doble A . The team achieved its first national championship in 1941 under the then Federación Deportiva del Norte ( Sports Federation of the North ) as the Utuado Stars. Their second national championship was in 1970 under the current baseball federation. The team won their third national championship on September 1, 2007, against the Bravos de Cidra ( Cidra Braves ). On September 14, 2014, the Montañeses won their fourth national championship title against the Brujos de Guayama ( Guayama Warlocks ) in a 7-game final.\\n\nOn May 16, 2019, the Montañeses signed Diamilette Quiles , making her not only the first female to play for the team, but also the first female signed in Béisbol Doble A . Quiles was previously on the roster for the Lobas de Arecibo ( Arecibo Wolves ) in the Puerto Rico Women\\'s Amateur Baseball Federation as well as playing softball for Puerto Rico in the Central American and Pan American Games .\\n\nUtuado\\'s table tennis players include sisters Adriana , Melanie , Gabriela and Fabiola Díaz, Brian Afanador (cousin to the Díaz sisters), Daniel González, Richard Pietri, Daniely Ríos and Yomar González, all members of the \\xc3\\x81guilas de la Montaña Table Tennis Club. Both Brian Afanador and Adriana Diaz, members of the International Table Tennis Federation World HOPES Team, have risen to prominence all over the Caribbean, Latin America and the world in their respective categories. The head coaches of the table tennis athletes are Bladimir Diaz, father of the Díaz sisters, and Eladio Afanador, a high-level performance program coach.\\n\nUtuado celebrates its patron saint festival in September. The Fiestas Patronales de San Miguel Arcangel is a religious and cultural celebration to honor the archangel Michael and generally features games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Utuado include:\\n\nTransportation\nWith the recent completion of Highway 10 , Utuado has become one of the easiest towns in the interior mountainous region to reach from the San Juan metropolitan area . What used to be a 3-hour trip has been reduced to 1 hour and 30 minutes (to reach the central town). There are 64 bridges in Utuado.  Many of Utuados roads and bridges were destroyed by Hurricane Maria in 2017.  Utuado sustained approximately $36 million in damages to its roads and bridges as a result of the hurricane .  Funding to reconstruct a bridge in Arenas barrio, destroyed by Hurricane Maria in 2017, was made available in February 2021 and work was set to begin in June.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  The flag, coat of arms and anthem of Utuado were all adopted in 1987, under the incumbency of Mayor Waldemar Quiles . The flag and coat of arms were designed by Amílcar Rivera Díaz; he is also the writer and composer of the anthem of Utuado.\\n\nThe flag consists of three colored stripes, green, brown and blue laid across; green for the mountains of the town, brown for the fertile soils and blue for the many rivers across the municipality. Centered in the flag is the sun of Otoao, a Taíno representation of the sun.  \\n\nThe coat of arms bears a shield with a cemí (deity or ancestral spirit) and a silver sword. The color of the cemí alludes to the color of the earth, while the silver sword with a hilt in gold recalls Saint Michael , the town\\'s patron. The Taíno mythological figure that appears on the upper left side symbolizes the \"Caguana woman\". The mine, the peak and the gold shovel crossed by the lamp of the copper miners establish the mineral wealth of this area. Finally, the blue background of the coat of arms remembers its skies, while the lower white stripe alludes to the Viví River that crosses the town.  \\n\nThe anthem of Utuado is titled \" Valle Bendito el de Mi Otoao \" ( Blessed Valley of my Otoao ).\\n\nEducation\nThere are currently 20 schools under the Puerto Rico Department of Education system, 2 private schools and one college level institution; the vast majority of children in Utuado attend public schools. The main primary-level education institutions include María Libertad Gómez, Bernardo González, and Judith A. Vivas, among others located outside Utuado Pueblo. Among the principal secondary-level institutions are the Francisco Ramos Middle School, Luis Muñoz Rivera High School and Antonio Reyes Padilla Vocational High School. While most students attend the before-mentioned schools, Utuado also has two private education institutions, both primary-level: Colegio Utuadeño San José and Academia Dailén. Founded in 1979, the University of Puerto Rico at Utuado is the youngest campus of the University of Puerto Rico and the only post secondary-level institution in Utuado, specializing in agricultural studies in areas such as pest control, horticulture, livestock industry and agricultural production.\\n\nNotable people\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nVega Baja, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nVega Baja  is a town and municipality located on the coast of north central Puerto Rico . It is north of Morovis , east of Manatí , and west of Vega Alta . Vega Baja is spread over 14 barrios. The population of the municipality was 54,414 at the 2020 census .  It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo metropolitan statistical area .\\n\nHistory\nThe name Vega Baja in Spanish means \\'lower valley\\' ( Vega Alta meaning \\'upper valley\\'). Historians believe that the name Vega Baja comes from La Vega . Vega is a surname of one of the families involved in the foundation of Vega Baja. It is also believed that the name comes from the region of Spain La Vega Baja del Segura . Additionally, in Caribbean Spanish , a vega is also a tobacco plantation.  \\n\nAlthough is generally believed that Vega Baja was founded in 1776, after the division of Vega Alta from La Vega (modern day Vega Alta) historians have verified that it was many years later when it was officially recognized by the Spanish government. The foundation day is October 7, and it is also the day of commemorating the Virgin of the Rosary . Vega Baja was originally known as Vega-baxa del Naranjal de Nuestra Señora del Rosario (Vega Baja of the Orange Grove of Our Lady of the Rosary).\\n\nCibuco is one of the rivers that goes through Vega Baja, and is a variation of the name Sebuco , who was a chief or Cacique Taíno of the region. These small tribes of Taínos were known to settle in the vicinity of the rivers. Although the Cibuco River is prone to floods due to heavy seasonal rains, the benefits provided to the land by the river are numerous.\\n\nTaino rock carvings have been found on some of the exposed reefs in the vicinity of the Cibuco River. Among these carvings is one depicting a face and others shaped as fish. They are an indication that these reefs were frequented for spear fishing and perhaps other day-to-day activities. Other places like Carmelita, Maisabel, Cueva Maldita and Paso del Indio are known as archaeological sites where the aborigines established their communities.\\n\nDrug trafficking has been an issue in Vega Baja for many years  and in early 1990, $43 million dollars in cash was found buried in plastic barrels, thought to have been deposited by drug smugglers for later retrieval. The sudden wealth of a few Vega Baja residents attracted attention and prompted an investigation by FBI and local police.  By May 1990, the FBI had traced $11 million and seized and confiscated property and goods purchased with the money thought to belong to drug lord Ramon Torres Gonzalez.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. With an area of about 121.4 square kilometres (46.9 sq mi) Vega Baja is a municipality on the north coast with some barrios on the coast and others in more mountainous areas. With an estimated population of 53,674 (2016, Census estimates) when Hurricane Maria struck, 48.5% were below poverty and 21.8% were people over the age of 60. The hurricane triggered numerous landslides in the municipality. Rivers were breached causing flooding of low-lying areas, and infrastructure including homes were destroyed. A tributary of the Cibuco River rose immediately putting 100 people\\'s lives at risk. Many of those residents took refuge on roofs or sought out small boats to navigate the flooded waters and to help remove people who were trapped on roofs or inside residences. Then municipal staff picked people up in buses and took them to the shelter at the Lino Padrón school, where the electric generator nor school cistern worked. Telecommunications systems were destroyed causing state and municipal rescue officers to have to rely on radio communication signals, which were limited to a radius of a few miles. Radio signals did not reach Vega Baja and news, such as the fact that a curfew had been declared, only spread by word of mouth. The mayor, who lost his home, said the storm surge and hurricane winds destroyed most of the structures in Cerro Gordo, a coastal sector. The urban, downtown areas were impassable due to the large number of downed trees and power lines. The Cibuco River roe above PR-2 highway, preventing the passage to the adjoining town/ municipality of Vega Alta and heading west, a stretch could be covered with extreme difficulty, until it was also blocked with the rising of the Río Grande de Manatí . The mayor stated, \"We don\\'t know what happened on the mountain. We have not been able to get there yet,\" and \"The destruction is so great. I don\\'t know how to explain seeing the despair of a mother or an elderly person right now. It is not easy what we are living.\"    \\n\nGeography\nVega Baja is located on the northern coast.  The municipality is located along the Northern Karst region of Puerto Rico, and the town is located on the Northern Plains.\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Vega Baja is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio called \"Pueblo\" (barrio-pueblo on the US Census).    Note: While the US Census and the PR GIS data, indicate there are 14 barrios in Vega Baja, the Vega Baja government page seems to exclude Vega Baja barrio-pueblo in its list of barrios.  \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth.

In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Vega Baja was 10,305.\\n\nTourism\nThere are 14 beaches in Vega Baja.  \\nSome main attractions of Vega Baja include:\\n\nEconomy\nThe abundant fertility of its soil has meant Vega Baja has much agricultural and farming land. In addition, Vega Baja has one of the most visited beaches of the northern coastline, Puerto Nuevo Beach (officially Mar Bella Beach ). This beach attracts thousands of beachgoers annually, making it a center for local tourism, especially during the hot summer months.  It boasts a natural rock formation of enormous proportions both in height and length colloquially named La Peña . This rock feature shelters the beach portion from the open seas just behind it. During rough marine conditions, the rock feature protects beachgoers, while the spectacle of waves crashing from behind and cascading down its face can be appreciated in the relative safety of the beach.  \\n\nCulture\nVega Baja celebrates its patron saint festival in October. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Virgen del Rosario is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Vega Baja include:\\n\nGovernment\nVega Baja, like all municipalities of Puerto Rico , elect a mayor every four years to administer the city. The educator Marcos Cruz Molina is the mayor since 2013 and Rafael \"Piro\" Martinez is the President of the Municipal Legislature.\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district III , which is represented by two senators. In 2012, José \"Joito\" Pérez and \\xc3\\x81ngel \"Chayanne\" Martínez were elected as District Senators. Rafael (Tatito) Hernández is the Eleventh District Representative and Hector Torres the Twelve District Representative at the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico.\\n\nTransportation\nThere are 23 bridges in Vega Baja.  \\n\nNotable people\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nVega Baja\\'s flag consists of a yellow cloth crossed by a green band.

        "page_content": "Contents\nVieques, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nVieques , officially Isla de Vieques , is an island, town and municipality of Puerto Rico , and together with Culebra , it is geographically part of the Spanish Virgin Islands . Vieques lies about 8 miles (13 km) east of the mainland of Puerto Rico , measuring about 20 miles (32 km) long and 4.5 miles (7 km) wide. Its most populated barrio is the town of Isabel Segunda (or \"Isabel the Second\", sometimes written \"Isabel II\"), the administrative center located on the northern side of the island. The population of Vieques was 8,249 at the 2020 Census.\\n\nThe island\\'s name is a Spanish spelling of a Taíno word said to mean \"small island\" or \"small land\". It also has the nickname Isla Nena , usually translated as \"girl island\" or \"little girl island\", alluding to its perception as Puerto Rico\\'s little sister. The island was given this name by the Puerto Rican poet Luís Lloréns Torres . During the British colonial period, its name was Crab Island .\\n\nVieques is best known internationally as the site of a series of protests , held against the United States Navy \\'s use of the island as a bombing range and testing-ground, leading to the Navy\\'s departure in 2003.  Today, the former navy lands are a national wildlife refuge ; some of it is open to the public, but much remains closed off due to biological or chemical contamination or unexploded ordnance that the military is, slowly, cleaning up.  \\n\nSome of the most beautiful beaches on the island are on the eastern end (former site of the Marine Base) that the Navy named Red Beach, Blue Beach , Caracas Beach , Pata Prieta Beach, La Chiva Beach, and Plata Beach. At the far western tip (formerly the Navy Base) is Punta Arenas , which the Navy named \\'Green Beach\\'. The beaches are commonly listed among the top in the Caribbean for their azure waters and white sands.  \\n\nHistory\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Vieques was first inhabited by ancient Indigenous peoples of the Americas who traveled mostly from South America perhaps between 3000 BCE and 2000 BCE. Estimates of these prehistoric dates of inhabitation vary widely. These tribes had a Stone Age culture and were probably fishermen and hunter-gatherers .\\n\nExcavations at the Puerto Ferro site by Luis Chanlatte and Yvonne Narganes  uncovered a fragmented human skeleton in a large hearth area. Radiocarbon dating of shells found in the hearth indicate a burial date of c. 1900 BCE. This skeleton, popularly known as El Hombre de Puerto Ferro , was buried at the center of a group of large boulders near Vieques\\'s south-central coast, approximately one kilometer northwest of the Bioluminescent Bay . Linear arrays of smaller stones radiating from the central boulders are apparent at the site today, but their age and reason for placement are unknown.\\n\nFurther waves of settlement by Native Americans followed over many centuries. The Arawak -speaking Saladoid (or Igneri ) people, thought to have originated in modern-day Venezuela , arrived in the region perhaps around 200 BC (estimates vary). These tribes, noted for their pottery, stone carving, and other artifacts, eventually merged with groups from Hispaniola and Cuba to form what is now called the Taíno culture. This culture flourished in the region from around 1000 AD until the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century.\\n\nThe European discovery of Vieques is sometimes credited to Christopher Columbus , who landed in Puerto Rico in 1493. It does not seem to be certain whether Columbus personally visited Vieques, but in any case the island was soon claimed by the Spanish. During the early 16th century Vieques became a center of Taíno rebellion against the European invaders, prompting the Spanish to send armed forces to the island to quell the resistance. The native Taíno population was decimated, and its people either killed, imprisoned or enslaved by the Spanish.  \\n\nThe Spanish did not, however, permanently colonize Vieques at this time, and for the next 300 years it remained a lawless outpost, frequented by pirates and outlaws. As European powers fought for control in the region, a series of attempts by the French , English and Danish to colonize the island in the 17th and 18th centuries were repulsed by the Spanish.\\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the Spanish took steps to permanently settle and secure the island. In 1811, Don Salvador Meléndez, then governor of Puerto Rico, sent military commander Juan Rosselló to begin what would become the annexation of Vieques by the Puerto Ricans.  \\n\nIn 1832, under an agreement with the Spanish Puerto Rican administration, Frenchman Teófilo José Jaime María Le Guillou became Governor of Vieques, and undertook to impose order on the anarchic province. He was instrumental in the establishment of large plantations, marking a period of social and economic change. Le Guillou is now remembered as the founder of Vieques (though this title is also sometimes conferred on Francisco Saínz, governor from 1843 to 1852, who founded Isabel Segunda , the main town in Vieques, named after Queen Isabel II of Spain). Vieques was formally annexed to Puerto Rico in 1854.\\n\nIn 1816, Vieques was briefly visited by Simón Bolívar when his ship ran aground there while fleeing defeat in Venezuela.  \\n\nDuring the second part of the 19th century, thousands of slaves of African descent were brought to Vieques to work the sugarcane plantations . They arrived from mainland Puerto Rico and nearby islands of St. Thomas , Nevis , Saint Kitts , Saint Croix , and many other Caribbean islands. Slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico in 1873.  \\n\nThe island also received considerable attention as a possible colony from Scotland , and after numerous attempts to buy the island proved unsuccessful, the Scottish fleet, en route to Darien in 1698, made landfall and took possession of the island in the name of the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and The Indies . Scottish sovereignty of the island proved short-lived, as a Danish ship arrived shortly afterward and claimed the island. From 1689 to 1693, the island was controlled by Brandenburg-Prussia as Krabbeninsel ( German crab island ), where the English name Crab Island came from.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Vieques was 6,642 (but this included 704 residents from a nearby island, Culebra ).  \\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the sugar industry , on which Vieques was dependent, went into decline due to falling prices and industrial unrest. Many locals were forced to move to mainland Puerto Rico or Saint Croix to look for work.\\n\nIn 1941, while Europe was in the midst of World War II , the United States Navy purchased or seized almost eighty percent  of Vieques as an extension to the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station nearby on the Puerto Rican mainland. It is said that the original purpose of the base (never implemented) was to provide a safe haven for the British fleet and the British royal family should Great Britain fall to Nazi Germany .  This assertion does not match U.S. Navy documents and the obvious fact that Canada\\'s Halifax harbor would have been a more likely fallback position for the British fleet, with British King George VI already reigning as King of Canada. The base was however seen as the Atlantic\\'s counterpart of Pearl Harbor in the Pacific due to its strategic location. The Naval Station at Roosevelt Roads was a perfect location to defend the strategic approaches to the Panama Canal .\\n\nMuch of the land was bought from the owners of large farms and sugar cane plantations, and the expropriations triggered the final demise of the sugar industry. Without consulting the local population who had lived and worked there for centuries and protested the expropriations,  the decision to turn it into a bombing range was made in Washington. In a similar way as the former population of the Chagos Islands , who were displaced to make way for an Air Force Base in the Indian Ocean in the 1960s, many agricultural workers, who had no formal title to the land they occupied, were evicted and forced to migrate.   \\n\nFor over sixty years, the US military used the island (with a population of over 9000 inhabitants in 1950  ) as a live munitions target practice. According to internal Navy documents, bombardments occurred on 180 days out of a year on average. The US military used the highest possible contaminant depleted uranium (DU) munitions since 1972 on the populated (and full of exotic wildlife) island, at a rate of over 80 live bombs daily for decades.   The health consequences are felt to this day as the cancer rates are ostensibly higher for the population of Vieques, especially children, than for those on the main island.  \\n\nAfter the war, the US Navy continued to use the island for military exercises, and as a firing range and testing ground for munitions .\\n\nThe continuing postwar presence in Vieques of the United States Navy drew protests from the local community, angry at the expropriation of their land and the environmental impact of weapons testing. The locals\\' discontent was exacerbated by the island\\'s perilous economic condition.\\n\nProtests came to a head in 1999 when Vieques native David Sanes , a civilian employee of the United States Navy, was killed by a jet bomb that the Navy said misfired. Sanes had been working as a security guard. A popular campaign of civil disobedience resurged; not since the mid-1970s had Viequenses come together en masse to protest the target practices.  The locals took to the ocean in their small fishing boats and successfully stopped the US Navy\\'s military exercises for a short period, until the US Navy and two US Coast Guard cutters began controlling access to the island and escorting boaters away from Vieques.\\n\nOn April 27, 2001, the Navy resumed operations and protesting resumed.  At this point over 600 protesters had already been detained.  \\n\nThe Vieques issue became something of a cause cél\\xc3 8bre , and local protesters were joined by sympathetic groups and prominent individuals from the mainland United States and abroad, including political leaders Rubén Berríos , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson , singers Danny Rivera , Willie Colón  and Ricky Martin , actors Edward James Olmos and Jimmy Smits , boxer Félix \\'Tito\\' Trinidad , baseball superstar Carlos Delgado , writers Ana Lydia Vega and Giannina Braschi , and Guatemala\\'s Nobel Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú . Kennedy\\'s son, Aidan Caohman \"Vieques\" Kennedy,  was born while his father served jail time in Puerto Rico for his role in the protests. The problems arising from the US Navy base have also featured in songs by various musicians, including Puerto Rican rock band Puya , rapper Immortal Technique and reggaeton artist Tego Calderón . In popular culture, one subplot of \" The Two Bartlets \" episode of The West Wing dealt with a protest on the bombing range led by a friend of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman ; the character was modeled on future West Wing star Jimmy Smits , a native of Puerto Rico who was repeatedly arrested for leading protests there.\\n\nAs a result of this pressure, in May 2003 the Navy withdrew from Vieques, and much of the island was designated a National Wildlife Refuge under the control of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service .  The island was also placed on the National Priorities List (NPL), the list of hazardous waste sites in the United States eligible for long-term remedial action (cleanup) financed by the federal Superfund program. Closure of Roosevelt Roads Naval Station followed in 2004, and prior to Hurricane Maria the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station was reopened.\\n\nPuerto Rico was struck by Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, and the storm caused widespread devastation and a near-total shutdown of the island\\'s tourism-based economy. The largest hotel on the island, The W, has not reopened since the storm, but most smaller hotels, bed and breakfasts, and Airbnb operators have resumed operations.  \\n\nAs of December 2019, the Susana Centeno Hospital in Vieques had not been repaired and remained shuttered. Expectant mothers had to travel to the main island of Puerto Rico to give birth. People needing dialysis had to travel to the main island. In November 2018, a mobile dialysis machine was delivered to a temporary clinic.  \\n\nOn January 21, 2020, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved $39.5 million to help rebuild its only hospital after damage caused by Hurricane Maria. FEMA approved the funding after the Office of Management and Budget agreed to provide money to rebuild the Susan Centeno community health center based on its \"replacement value.\"  \\n\nThe family of Jaideliz Moreno Ventura, 13, whose 2020 death was blamed on the lack of a functioning hospital and lifesaving medical equipment in Vieques, is suing the government for violation of human and civil rights. Funds for rebuilding the hospital were approved two weeks after Jaideliz\\'s death, but as of January 31, 2021, it has not been rebuilt.  \\n\nWhile Governor Pedro Pierluisi expected construction to begin on the hospital rebuild in 2022,  it was delayed until 2023 with the holdup blamed on both construction complications on the island and further bureaucratic proceduress by FEMA .  \\n\nGovernment\nVieques is a municipio of Puerto Rico , translated as \"municipality\" and in this context roughly equivalent to \"township\". It is in the Puerto Rican electoral district of Carolina. Local government is under the leadership of a mayor, presently Junito Corcino.\\n\nVieques belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VIII , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Pedro A. Rodríguez and Luis Daniel Rivera were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nVieques is divided into eight barrios , including the downtown barrio called Isabel Segunda.   \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Vieques: Sector Gobeo in Barrio Florida, Bravos de Boston, \\nJagüeyes, Monte Carmelo, Pozo Prieto (Monte Santo) and Villa Borinquén.  \\n\nGeography\nVieques measures about 21 miles (34 km) east-west, and three to four miles (6.4 km) north-south. It has a land area of 52 square miles (130 km 2 ) and is located about ten miles (16 km) to the east of Puerto Rico. To the north of Vieques is the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south, the Caribbean . The island of Culebra is about 10 miles (16 km) north of Vieques, and the United States Virgin Islands lie to the east. Vieques and Culebra, together with various small islets, make up the Spanish Virgin Islands , sometimes known as the Passage Islands. [ citation needed ]  \\n\nThe former US Navy lands, now wildlife reserves, occupy the entire eastern and western ends of Vieques, with the former live weapons testing site (known as the \"LIA\", or \"Live Impact Area\") at the extreme eastern tip.  These areas are unpopulated. The former civilian area occupies very roughly the central third of the island and contains the towns of Isabel Segunda on the north coast, and Esperanza on the south.\\n\nVieques has a terrain of rolling hills, with a central ridge running east-west. The highest point is Monte Pirata at 987 feet (301 m). Geologically the island is composed of a mixture of volcanic bedrock , sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone , and alluvial deposits of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. There are no permanent rivers or streams. Much former agricultural land has been reclaimed by nature due to prolonged disuse, and, apart from some small-scale farming in the central region, the island is largely covered by brush and subtropical dry forest . Around the coast lie palm-fringed sandy beaches interspersed with lagoons, mangrove swamps , salt flats and coral reefs . [ citation needed ] \\n\nA series of nearshore islets and rocks are part of the municipality of Vieques, clockwise starting at the northernmost:\\n\nThe Vieques Bioluminescent Bay (also known as Puerto Mosquito , Mosquito Bay , or \"The Bio Bay\" ), was declared the \"Brightest bioluminescent bay\" in the world by Guinness World Records in 2006,  and is listed as a national natural landmark , one of five in Puerto Rico . The luminescence in the bay is caused by a microorganism , the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense , which glows whenever the water is disturbed, leaving a trail of neon blue.\\n\nA combination of factors creates the necessary conditions for bioluminescence: red mangrove trees surround the water (the organisms have been related to mangrove forests  although mangrove is not necessarily associated with this species  ); a complete lack of modern development around the bay; the water is warm enough and deep enough; and a small channel to the ocean keeps the dinoflagellates in the bay. This small channel was created artificially, the result of attempts by the occupants of Spanish ships to choke off the bay from the ocean. The Spanish believed that the bioluminescence they encountered there while first exploring the area was the work of the devil and tried to block ocean water from entering the bay by dropping huge boulders in the channel. [ citation needed ] The Spanish only succeeded in preserving and increasing the luminescence in the now isolated bay.\\n\nKayaking is permitted in the bay and may be arranged through local vendors.\\n\nVieques has a warm, relatively dry, tropical climate. Temperatures vary little throughout the year, with average daily maxima ranging from 84.7 °F (29.3 °C) in January to 89.9 °F (32.2 °C) in September. Average daily minima are about 18 °F or 6 °C lower. Rainfall averages around 40 to 45 inches (1,000 to 1,100 millimetres) per year, with the month of September being the wettest. The west of the island receives significantly more rainfall than the east. Prevailing winds are easterly.\\n\nVieques is prone to tropical storms and at risk from hurricanes from June to November. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo caused considerable damage to the island,  and in 2017, Hurricane Maria also caused major damage.  \\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2020 Census, Vieques is the third-least populous municipality (after Maricao and Culebra ) with a population of 8,249.  \\n\n8.0% of the population is of non-Hispanic origin, making it the second-least Hispanic municipality in Puerto Rico after Culebra . This represents an increase from 2010, when only 5.7% of the population was non-Hispanic.  \\n\nThe 2010 US census,  showed the total population of Vieques was 9,301. 94.3% of the population are Hispanic or Latino (of any race). Natives of Vieques are known as Viequenses .\\n\nBoth Spanish and English are recognized as official languages. Spanish is the primary language of most inhabitants.\\n\nEconomy\nThe sugar industry , once the mainstay of the island\\'s economy, declined during the early 20th century, and finally collapsed in the 1940s when the US Navy took over much of the land on which the sugar cane plantations stood. After an initial naval construction phase, opportunities to make a living on the island were increased to include not only fishing or subsistence farming, but also Naval jobs. Crops grown on the island include avocados , bananas, coconuts , grains, papayas and sweet potatoes . A number of permanent local jobs were provided by the US Navy, and their economy benefited. Starting in the 1970s General Electric had employed a few hundred workers at a manufacturing plant but that plant subsequently closed.  Unemployment was widespread, with consequent social problems. The 2000 US census reported a median household income in 1999 dollars of $9,331 (compared to $41,994 for the US as a whole), and 35.8% of the population of 16 years and over in the labor force (compared to 63.9% for the US as a whole).  \\n\nFollowing the 2003 departure of the US Navy, the frail economy of the island was left in shambles, and efforts had to be made to redevelop the island\\'s agricultural economy, clean up contaminated areas of the former bombing ranges, and to develop Vieques as a tourist destination. The Navy cleanup is now the island\\'s largest employer, and has contributed over $20 million to the local economy over the last five years through salaries, housing, vehicles, taxes, and services. The Navy has provided specialized training to several local islanders.\\n\nTourism\nFor sixty years the majority of Vieques was closed off by the US Navy, and the island remained almost entirely undeveloped for tourism. This lack of development is now marketed as a key attraction. Vieques is promoted under an ecotourism banner as a sleepy, unspoiled island of rural bucolic charm and pristine deserted beaches, and is rapidly becoming a popular destination.\\n\nSince the Navy\\'s departure, tensions on the island have been low, although land speculation by foreign developers and fears of overdevelopment have caused some resentment among local residents, and there are occasional reports of lingering anti-American sentiment .  \\n\nThe lands previously owned by the Navy have been turned over to the U.S. National Fish and Wildlife Service and the authorities of Puerto Rico and Vieques for management. The immediate bombing range area on the eastern tip of the island suffers from severe contamination, but the remaining areas are mostly open to the public, including many beautiful beaches that were inaccessible to civilians while the military was conducting training maneuvers.\\n\nSnorkeling is excellent, especially at Blue Beach (Bahía de la Chiva). Aside from archeological sites, such as La Hueca, and deserted beaches, a unique feature of Vieques is the presence of two pristine bioluminescent bays, including Mosquito Bay. Vieques is also famous for its paso fino horses, which are owned by locals and left to roam free over parts of the island.   \\n\nIn 2011, TripAdvisor listed Vieques among the Top 25 Beaches in the World, writing \"If you prefer your beaches without the accompanying commercial developments, Isla de Vieques is your tanning turf, with more than 40 beaches and not one traffic light.\"  \\n\nAs of summer 2020, travel to the island was restricted due to the COVID-19 outbreak .  \\n\nCulture\nVieques celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Señora del Carmen is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Vieques include:\\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe Vieques flag, approved in 1975, contains a representation of the municipal coat of arms and maintains its same symbolism. It consists of seven horizontal straight stripes, of equal width, four white and three blue, alternated. In its center is a green rhombus where a simplified design of the castle appears in yellow. The naval crown seen on the coat of arms is omitted from the flag.  \\n\nOn a barry shield with silver and blue waves is a green rhombus with a gold castle and on top is a golden crown with silver sails. The silver and blue waves symbolize the sea around Vieques. In the green rhombus is a historic Vieques fort represented by the traditional Spanish heraldic castle.  \\n\nTransportation\nVieques is served by Antonio Rivera Rodríguez Airport , which currently accommodates only small propeller-driven aircraft. Services to the island run from San Juan \\'s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport , Isla Grande Airport (20- to 30-minute flights) and from Ceiba Airport (5-minute flights) and to Culebra . Flights are also available between Vieques and Saint Croix , Tortola , Virgin Gorda and Saint Thomas .\\n\nAlso, a ferry runs from Ceiba several times a day. The ferry service is administered by the Autoridad de Transporte Marítimo (ATM) in Puerto Rico.  In 2019, governor Wanda Vázquez Garced said she would address the troubled, inconsistent ferry service between the islands and Ceiba.  \\n\nThere are 13 bridges in Vieques, none of them distinguished.  \\n\nPublic health\nThere have been claims linking Vieques\\' higher cancer rate  to the long history of weapons testing on the island.\\n\nNayda Figueroa, an epidemiologist for Puerto Rico\\'s Cancer Registry, stated that research showed Vieques\\' cancer rate from 1995 to 1999 was 31 percent higher than for the main island. Michael Thun , head of epidemiological research at the American Cancer Society, cautioned that the variations in the rates could be attributed to chance, given the small population on Vieques.  \\nA 2000 Nuclear Regulatory Commission report concluded that \"the public had not been exposed to depleted uranium contamination above normal background (naturally occurring) levels\".  \\n\nSurveys of the wreckage of a target ship in a shallow bay at the bombing range, however, revealed its identity to be that of the USS Killen , a target ship in nuclear tests in the Pacific in 1958. By 2002, it was evident that thousands of tons of steel that had originally been irradiated in the 1958 nuclear tests was missing from the wreckage in the bay. That steel has been missing for over 35 years and is still unaccounted for by the US Navy, Environmental Protection Agency and US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Hundreds of steel drums of unknown origin were found among the wreckage. Their identity and contents have not been adequately verified. [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn response to concerns about potential contamination from toxic metals and other chemicals, the ATSDR conducted a number of surveys in 1999-2002 to test Vieques\\' soil, water supply, air, fish and shellfish for harmful substances. The general conclusion of the ATSDR survey was that no public health hazard existed as a result of the Navy\\'s activities.  However, scientists have pointed out that fish samples were drawn from local markets, which often import fish from other areas. Also sample sizes from each location were too small to provide compelling evidence for the lack of a public health danger (Wargo, Green Intelligence). The conclusions of the ATSDR report have more recently, as of 2009 [update] , been questioned and discredited. A review is underway.    \\n\nCasa Pueblo, a Puerto Rican environmental group, reported \"a series of studies pertaining to the flora and fauna of Vieques that clearly demonstrates sequestration of high levels of toxic elements in plant and animal tissue samples. Consequently, the ecological food web of the Vieques Island has been adversely impacted.\"  \\n\nNotable people\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

Villalba is spread over 6 barrios and Villalba Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the Ponce Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nVillalba was founded in 1917 by José Ramón Figueroa y Rivera and Walter McJones . Its current mayor is Luis Javier Hernández Ortiz.\\nBy 1918, there weren\\'t any highways connecting Villalba to its neighboring towns but by 1927 there was at least one.  \\n\nHurricane Maria passed through the area on September 20, 2017 and triggered numerous landslides in Villalba with significant rainfall.   Bridges were destroyed and many areas where vital infrastructure was located were inaccessible. The entire electrical system was destroyed. Villalba\\'s emergency operations center and an assisted living center were among the many buildings destroyed in Villalba.  Villalba received 27.82 inches of rain. The mayor\\'s stated \"Our main need is oxygen. Many people depend on oxygen through artificial respirators that require electricity.\".  \\n\n\"From Catastrophe to Hope\" ( De la catastrofe a la esperanza ), a documentary describing the destruction of infrastructure in Villalba and how volunteers, community members, the mayor, and emergency service personnel worked to try to save people\\'s lives was published in 2019 by Noticias de Villalba (Villalba News). The mountainous geography of Villalba made restoring electricity and water services extremely challenging. Chaplains , and religious leaders of all denominations, provided emotional support to all involved.  \\n\n\\nSubsequent to the hurricane, in 2018, Javier Hernández, the mayor discussed other options for electrical power, such as micro-grids, for Villalba, with the mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey , reminding him that recovery from such a powerful hurricane would take years.   Architect Jonathan Marvel talked about his company\\'s plans to build an off-the-grid, 41-unit building in Villalba on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria. \nGeography\nVillalba is located in the central region of Puerto Rico, on a valley in the Cordillera Central .  The highest point in the municipality is Cerro El Bolo at 3,526 feet (1,075 m) of elevation.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Villalba is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion .

        "page_content": "Contents\nYabucoa, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nYabucoa  is a town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the eastern region, north of Maunabo ; south of San Lorenzo , Las Piedras and Humacao ; and east of Patillas . Yabucoa is spread over 9 barrios and Yabucoa Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Yabucoa is said to come from the Taíno name Guaroca , both a toponymic and personal name meaning \"where water [is found]\". However this is considered a folk etymology and other linguists suggest the name is most likely a Spanish interpretation of the Taíno word yaucoa (similar to the name Yauco ) which means \" cassava plantation\".  \\n\nSome nicknames of the city are \"Sugar City\", after the numerous sugarcane plantations of the Yabucoa Valley , and Pueblo de Yuca (\"Yuca Town\") which references the Taíno origin of the name of the town. The locals are also known as the Bebe Leches (\"milk drinkers\") after the numerous dairy farms located in the region.  \\n\nHistory\nThe region of what is now Yabucoa belonged to the Taíno region of Guayaney, which covered a portion of the southeast region of Puerto Rico.  The region was led by cacique Guaraca. After the Spanish colonization , the region of Yabucoa belonged to Humacao , and its territory was mostly used for cattle and farming. Yabucoa, as a town, was founded on October 3, 1793, when Don Manuel Colón de Bonilla and his wife, Doña Catalina Morales Pacheco, donated the lands to the people.   \\n\nHurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, as a high-end, category 4 hurricane, knocking out power to the entire island and also affected access to clean water. The hurricane made landfall in Camino Nuevo, Yabucoa  and triggered numerous landslides, caused widespread flooding and damaged critical infrastructure.     Yabucoa\\'s municipal buildings sustained mayor damages, and up to 2500 other structures in Yabucoa were affected.  \\n\nElderly were especially affected  because many homes were completely destroyed.  Many elderly living in Yabucoa died as a result of Hurricane Maria. People on oxygen machines died with the lack of electrical power. In June, 2018 the administrators of the municipality stated that they noticed an uptick in mortality rates (deaths) and were relaying the information since February, of 2018 but the government of Puerto Rico was not interested in hearing about it. Many more deaths were occurring than expected. An entire new section to the cemetery was built following the hurricane and the deaths that followed.  \\n\nAs of June 12, 2018, eight months after the hurricane, more than 30% of Yabucoa homes were still without electrical power, stated the mayor of Yabucoa, Rafael Surillo. He stated there were 4,000 residences with between 12,000 and 15,000 residents without electrical power, of 36,000 residents. Large swaths of Yabucoa municipality including Guayabota , Tejas , Juan Martín , Calabazas , Limones and Aguacate barrios, and 100% of Jácanas were without electrical power for nine months, some since Hurricane Irma had hit a week prior to Hurricane Maria.   \\n\nGeography\nThe municipality of Yabucoa is located in the south-eastern coast of Puerto Rico. The Valley of Yabucoa is surrounded by the hills of the San Lorenzo Batholith on three sides and by the Caribbean Sea on the fourth. The hills surrounding the Yabucoa Valley as well as the bedrock underlying the alluvium in the valley are composed of the San Lorenzo Batholith, a large, igneous intrusive body emplaced during the Late Cretaceous (Rogers, 1977; Rogers and others, 1979). The San Lorenzo Batholith is a composite body that is composed of gabbro (Kd), diorite , tonalite , granodiorite , and quartz monzonite . The Cuchillas de Panduras , a fork of the Sierra de Cayey in the Cordillera Central runs through its south. Santa Elena is one of its most prominent peaks with an altitude of 1,870 feet (570 meters). Santa Elena is located in Juan Martin ward. Pandura Peak rises 1,693 feet (516 meters) above sea level. Pandura is located in the Calabazas ward. The altitude of the hills surrounding the Valley of Yabucoa reaches a maximum of about 2,130 feet (650 meters) at the head of the Río Guayanés basin. The land surface in the Yabucoa Valley slopes gently from an altitude of about 98 feet (30 meters) above mean sea level, at the western edge of the valley, to sea level where the valley meets the Caribbean Sea.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Yabucoa is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Yabucoa: Ingenio, Jacanas Granja, Playa Guayanés, Tejas Trinidad, and Urbanización Jaime C. Rodríguez.   \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nEconomy\nYabucoa is known for its agricultural prowess because of the surrounding fertile valley that produces most of the island\\'s plantains and bananas . Yabucoeños are known as \"sugar people\" because most of the valley was used for sugar cane growth. In addition, one of the most visible landmarks when entering the municipality is the old Hacienda Roig sugar mill, one of the last mills that produced sugar in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nThere\\'s an oil recycling company, the only one in the Caribbean, called Olein Recovery Corp. operating in Yabucoa.   During the COVID-19 pandemic Olein began manufacturing hand sanitizer.  \\n\nCulture\nYabucoa celebrates its patron saint festival in September / October. The Fiestas Patronales de los Santos Angeles Custodios is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Yabucoa include:\\n\nCommunity events are held at the Concha Acústica Toño Márquez .  \\n\nAzucareros de Yabucoa are the Double-A (baseball) team of Yabucoa and have won 4 championships. They won the 1994 championship playing against the Toritos de Cayey . In 1995 they won against Cidra and in 1996 they won against Cabo Rojo.  In 2020, Azucareros de Yabucoa was the eighth Puerto Rico Double-A baseball team to have won 900 games.   \\n\nThe Estadio Félix \"Nacho\" Millán where the Azucareros played sustained significant damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017 and as of 2020 the stadium remains in disrepair.  \\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Yabucoa is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Rafael Surillo Ruiz , from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Surillo was elected at the 2012 general election and won reelected for his third term in 2020 with 65% of the vote.  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VII , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Jorge Suárez and José Luis Dalmau were elected as District Senators. A native of Yabucoa Ramón Luis Cruz Burgos was elected to represent the city in those elections.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe design of the flag of Yabucoa is abstract, inspired by the colors of the municipal shield; green, white and violet.  \\n\nIn the shield appear two angels the Santos Angeles Custodios, patron saints of Yabucoa. The color purple (violet) field of the shield represents the highest dignity of the angels. The walking sticks are attributes of the traveller, and refer to the holy office of the Angels as guides and companions in man\\'s journey in his earthly life. The canes are adorned with guajana flowers, representing the wealth of the sugar cane. The green land where the angels stand symbolizes the fertile valley in which Yabucoa is located.  \\n\nTransportation\nOne of the main roads to Yabucoa is the PR-3 , which borders the east side of the island. Distance from the capital is approximately 1 hour.  \\n\nIn 2008, a tunnel connecting the town of Yabucoa with the town of Maunabo was completed.   It is currently the longest on the island.\\n\nThere are 41 bridges in Yabucoa.  \\n\nNotable Yabucoeños\nMany residents of Yabucoa have served in the US military service and fought in US wars.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nYauco, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nYauco  is a town and municipality in southern Puerto Rico . Although the downtown is inland, the municipality stretches to a southern coast facing the Caribbean Sea . Yauco is located south of Maricao , Lares and Adjuntas ; east of Sabana Grande and Guánica ; and west of Guayanilla . The municipality consists of 20 barrios and Yauco Pueblo (the downtown and administrative center of the municipality). It is both a principal town of the Yauco Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Ponce-Yauco-Coamo Combined Statistical Area .\\n\nIt was founded by Fernando Pacheco on February 29, 1756, and developed for commodity crops of tobacco , sugar cane , and coffee . Yauco became a center for Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico in the 19th century due to its geographical similarity to their homeland. Corsicans have contributed to many areas of life in Yauco, particularly to its coffee industry . This has played a role in the town\\'s nicknames of El Pueblo del Café (Town of Coffee), and residents of the municipality are often referred to as Los Corsos (The Corsicans).\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nYauco was named after the Yauco River , which itself comes from the Taíno word coayuco , meaning \" cassava plantation\" (also where the word yucca comes from).  The city has numerous nicknames such as Pueblo del Café (\"coffee town\"), due to the high number of coffee plantations in the area, and Pueblo de los Corsos (\"Town of Corsicans \"), after the large number of Corsican immigrants who settled in the town and who were later influential to the area\\'s coffee industry. It is also popularly known as La Capital Taína (\"the Taíno capital\") after the native peoples of Puerto Rico who also lived in the area.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Taino natives considered the area of Yauco the capital of Boriken and was governed by Agüeybana , the most powerful Taíno cacique (chief) in the island. All the other caciques were subject to and had to obey Agüeybaná, although they governed their own tribes. Upon Agüeybaná\\'s death in 1510, his nephew, Güeybaná (also known as Agüeybaná II ), became the most powerful cacique in the island. Agüeybaná II doubted the \"godly\" status the Spaniards were rumored to have. He came up with a plan to test these doubts: he and Urayoán (cacique of Añasco ) sent some of their tribe members to lure a Spaniard named Diego Salcedo into a river and drown him. They watched over Salcedo\\'s body to ensure that he did not revive. Salcedo\\'s death convinced Agüeybaná II and the rest of the Taíno that the Spaniards were not gods. They rebelled against the Spanish in 1511 but were defeated.   \\n\nIn 1755, the Spanish settlers of the region built a small chapel and named it Nuestra Señora del Santísimo Rosario (Our Lady of the Holy Rosary). The settlers sent Fernando Pacheco as their representative to the Spanish Government, to request the establishment of a municipality, since they had satisfied one of the requirements for the establishment of a municipality, namely, to establish a place of worship. On February 29, 1756, the King of Spain granted the settlers their request and the town of Yauco was founded. Fernando Pacheco was named First Lieutenant of War of the new town.  \\n\nFrom the mid-19th to the early 20th century, hundreds of Corsican , Italian , French , Portuguese , Irish , Scots , and German immigrants arrived in Puerto Rico, attracted by the Spanish Crown\\'s offer of free land to Catholic white European settlers. They settled mostly in the south-central region.\\n\n\\nThe island of Puerto Rico is somewhat similar in geography to the island of Corsica and appealed to many Corsican immigrants. Corsica was part of the Republic of Genoa for centuries until 1768.\nCorsicans descend from a combination of ancient Corsi people from northeastern Sardinia and people who came over later from northern and central Italy (including Tuscans , Etruscans , Ligurians , and Romans ) along with, to a lesser extent, Greeks and Carthaginians . Corsica has been part of France since 1768 but retains a distinct Italian culture . It was ruled by the Republic of Genoa from 1284 to 1755, when it became a self-proclaimed independent Italian -speaking Republic. In 1768, Genoa officially ceded its out of control colony to Louis XV of France as part of a pledge for debts, and in 1769 France forcibly annexed it.\\n\nHundreds of Corsicans and their families immigrated to Puerto Rico from as early as 1830, and their numbers peaked in the 1850s, after European unrest following the Revolutions of 1848 , and environmental problems of lengthy drought. The Corsicans tended to settle in the mountainous southwestern region of the island, and Yauco attracted the majority of them.  As noted, the three main crops were coffee, sugar cane and tobacco. The new settlers first worked on the farms, and some saved money in order to own and operate their own grocery stores. They began to specialize in cultivation of coffee as a commodity crop.\\n\nCoffee was first cultivated in the Rancheras and Diego Hernández sectors; it was expanded to the Aguas Blancas , Frailes and Rubias sectors. The Mariani family adapted a cotton gin in the 1860s to use in mechanical de-husking of coffee . This improved the appearance of Puerto Rico\\'s coffee beans and helped it stand out in the international coffee market.  By the 1860s the Corsican settlers were the leaders of the coffee industry in Puerto Rico, and seven out of ten coffee plantations were owned by Corsicans.  \\n\nThe pro-independence movement raised the second and last major revolt here against Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico, known as the Intentona de Yauco (the attempted Coup of Yauco ). The revolt, which occurred on March 26, 1897, was organized by Antonio Mattei Lluberas , Mateo Mercado and Fidel Vélez. They were supported by leaders of El Grito de Lares , the first major independence attempt, who were in exile in New York City as members of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee. During this uprising, Vélez raised for the first time what became the current flag of Puerto Rico on local soil. Local Spanish authorities had heard rumors of the revolt and acted swiftly to suppress it.  \\n\nIn 1898, upon the outbreak of the Spanish-American War , Guánica was a small barrio within the municipality of Yauco. It had 60 houses in all and was defended only by eleven members of the 4th Volante de Yauco, a Puerto Rican militia unit, under the command of Lieutenant Enrique Méndez López. When the convoy with General Nelson A. Miles , approached the barrio, Guánica lighthouse keeper Robustiano Rivera immediately alerted its residents. Nearly all the residents abandoned their homes and joined Rivera to go to Yauco, where he broke the news of the invading forces to the town\\'s mayor. Only Agustín Barrenechea, Vicente Ferrer, Juan María Morciglio, Simón Mejil, Salvador Muñoz, Cornelio Serrano and Pascual Elena stayed to welcome the invaders. \nThe first skirmish between Spanish/Puerto Rican and American armed forces was fought in that barrio between the Puerto Rican militia and twenty-eight sailors and Marines , under the command of Lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood. They had come from the USS Gloucester on rafts and landed on the beach, where Lt. Méndez López and his men opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with a machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. Méndez López and three of his men were wounded, and the militia unit retreated to the town of Yauco.\\n\nThis was also the site of the first major land battle in Puerto Rico during the war between Spanish/Puerto Rican and American armed forces. On July 26, 1898, Spanish forces and Puerto Rican volunteers, led by Captain Salvador Meca and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Puig, fought against American forces led by Brigadier General George A. Garretson . The Spanish forces engaged the 6th Massachusetts in a firefight at the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, in what became known as the Battle of Yauco of the Puerto Rico Campaign . The casualties of Puig\\'s forces were two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead. The Spanish forces were ordered to retreat.  \\n\nSignificant rainfall from Hurricane Maria , on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Yauco, leaving entire communities cut-off.   The Yauco River caused flooding that decimated entire neighborhoods.  \\n\nMultiple residences and structures in Yauco were damaged in a series of earthquakes with increasing magnitude that started on December 28, 2019 and culminating with a 6.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the island in the morning hours of January 7, 2020.  More than thirty-two residences collapsed and hundreds were structurally unsound after the earthquake struck near Yauco. To aid residents who were left without power or homeless, the National Guard was mobilized. A center for emergency operations was set up in the municipality\\'s auditorium parking area, with air-conditioned tarps and tents for evacuated hospital patients and with food being cooked by World Central Kitchen .  \\n\nGeography\nYauco is a mountainous municipality located in the Cordillera Central and bisected by the Río Yauco . Other rivers in the municipality are the Río Chiquito , Duey Loco and Río Naranjo . Hills in the area include Mount Membrillo, the highest point in the municipality and 9th highest peak in the island at 3,579 feet (1,090 m) of elevation,  the Rodadero Peak  and the Curet Hill.   \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Yauco is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .    \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Yauco: Diego Hernández, Frailes, Ranchera, Sector Primitivo Irizarry in Quebradas, El Pozo, Sector Cantera, Pueblo Norte (El Cerro), and Río Prieto.   \\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau the population of Yauco in the year 2000 was 46,384 persons, decreasing to 42,043 persons in 2010 , a net loss of 4,341 people or 9.36% of its population. The urban zone accounted for 17,186 of its inhabitants in the 2010 census.  The 2020 census indicated the population was 34,172 a decline of 18.7% from the 2010 census.  \\n\nTourism\nFollowing Hurricane Maria , in order to lift up their spirits, Yauco\\'s artists worked on \"Yaucromatic\", a project to paint colorful murals in Cerro de Yauco in Yauco barrio-pueblo.  \\n\nThere are 2 beaches in Yauco, including Playa Ballenas .  \\nSome of the places of interest in Yauco include:\\n\nAt Yauco Pueblo (the historic downtown): \\n\nElsewhere in Yauco: \\n\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Yauco page lists the murals at Yaucromatic, the view from the top of a mountain in Sierra Alta called Pico Rodadero , the Refugio de Vida Silvestre del Embalse Luccieti ,  and (for agritourism ) a honey production farm in barrio Diego Hernandez called Apiturismo,  as places of interest.   \\n\nEconomy\nYauco\\'s main crops are coffee, plantains, oranges and tobacco. Yauco coffees are a revived specialty origin that, at best, display the qualities that made Jamaica Blue Mountain famous: A deep, vibrant, yet restrained acidity and balanced, gently rich flavor. However, this potentially finest of Caribbean coffees is often marred by inconsistency.  Coffee production and sales from Yauco reached faraway places such as Europe in the 19th century and many non-Yauco coffee producers even tried to link their products to the city.  Cafe Yaucono is a well-known Puerto Rican coffee brand that is named after Yauco.\\n\nYauco also produces textiles and other light manufactured materials.\\n\nSartorius pharmaceuticals, located in Yauco, expanded their current operations there in mid 2019.  \\n\nCulture\nYauco celebrates its patron saint festival in October. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Virgen del Rosario is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Yauco include:\\n\nRecent genealogical DNA-based testing, which look at specific locations of a person\\'s genome, in order to find or verify ancestral genealogical relationships or to estimate the ethnic mixture of an individual, have found significant Portuguese , Spanish , Native American , Corsican , Irish , Scottish , Germanic European, Italian , North African , West African and European Jewish DNA presence in individuals who are descendants from inhabitants who were born within the geographical area of Yauco and other parts of southwestern Puerto Rico.  \\n\nThese ethnicities have significantly influenced the local culture, to include food, art, some words used in the language, customs, beliefs, and music.\\n\nGovernment\nIn 2019, Angel Luis Torres is the mayor of Yauco.  \\n\nAbel Nazario Quiñones of the New Progressive Party had held the office of Mayor of Yauco since 2000. He succeeded Pedro Jaime Torres by winning the 2000 general election and retained his seat in both 2004 and 2008 .    Nazario took a 50% pay cut which was reversed in 2005, yet his current annual wage of $36,000 is the lowest for any of the 78 Puerto Rican mayors, despite Yauco not being the least-populated municipality or the one with the lowest budget.  \\n\nYauco belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Ramón Ruiz and Martín Vargas Morales , from the Popular Democratic Party , were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nTransportation\nInterstate Highway PRI-2 goes through Yauco. The interstate highway is designated as such because it receives up to 90% of its funding from the US Interstate Highway System .\\n\nIn 2019, there were 40 bridges in Yauco.  A bridge that goes over Yauco River suffered damages during 2017 Hurricane Maria .  A bridge that carries PR-359 would have to be demolished due to damages caused by the 2019-2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes .  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag of Yauco consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, black the superior and gold the inferior one. The municipal coat of arms is in the center.  \\n\nThe coat of arms of Yauco is quartered by a central cross representing Christendom .\\nIn a silver field a gold and black boiler, with seven necks and heads of black serpents in each handle, three to the right hand, confronted with four to the left-hand side. Bordered by a checkered band in gold and black. The second and third quarters, in a field of gold, two coffee plant flowers of five leaves of silver and four red. The coffee plant flower and the coffee grains represent their cultivation in the Yauco municipality. The border of the Arms represents the beads of the rosary. The four-tower crown represents its town status.  \\n\nNotable people\nThe following is a list of people born in Yauco.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"
