The school is located in Miramar in Puerto Rico \\'s capital city of San Juan . Students, teachers and alumni commonly refer to their school as Perpetuo.  \\n\nMission\nThe goal of the  Academia del Perpetuo Socorro is the complete development of the student - spiritually, mentally, morally, socially, culturally, and physically in order to live a full life and to prepare for his/her final goal - union with God. To this end, the school works to create a Catholic academic community in which faith, knowledge, and recreation are shared in a spirit of freedom, love, and creativity. The school, however, does not emphasize religion over other subjects, accepts students of all faiths and does not impose religious requirements such as baptism, confirmation or church attendance as a condition for continued attendance.\\n\nMotto\n\"Esto Perpetua\" translated as \"This Endures\" stressing how the Catholic values and formal academic education learned at this school, symbolized in the school seal by the oil lamp over the open book, (as in burning the midnight oil) are to permeate individuals and society forever.\\n\nClubs\nSports teams\nAcademia del Perpetuo Socorro has the largest gymnasium in the Caribbean. This gymnasium has three wooden volleyball courts that can also be transformed into two basketball courts. The gymnasium also has a small gym where athletes, faculty members, and students can go to do exercise.\\n\nPerpetuo has a varsity program in ten sports:\\n\nIn popular media\nThe school is featured prominently in Magali García Ramis \\'s novel Felices Días, Tío Sergio . The school was the main film location for the movie Casi casi (2006) and forms the basis for the fictional school featured in the film.\\n\nNotable alumni\nReferences"

The school is located on San Jorge Avenue in San Juan\\'s Santurce district.\\n\nHistory\nIn 1939, the Sisters of St. Joseph came to teach and administer the school until their departure in 1973. \\n\nIn 1959, its founder Msgr. José M. Rivera died and was replaced as parish priest by father Benito Cabrera. Father Cabrera started a campaign to remodel the school and the church, but was replaced in 1962 by Msgr. Thomas Maysonet who administered the school until 1972. \\n\nA major physical addition was constructed during his administration and was dedicated in 1965. This construction is the present school building.\\n\nIn 1972, Msgr.

It is used as a facility of the US Navy for ashore and U.S. and NATO ships, planes, and submarines operating at sea in areas of broadcast coverage near Aguada, Puerto Rico at 18°23\\xe2\\x80\\xb255\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 67°10\\xe2\\x80\\xb238\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.39861°N 67.17722°W ﻿ / 18.39861; -67.17722 by using radio waves in the very low frequency range.\\n\nThe Aguada transmission station, originally part of \"The Naval Radio Transmitter Facility Aguada\", works on very low frequency (VLF) 40.75 kHz with the callsign NAU. The Naval Radio Transmitter Facility Aguada, apparently consisted of three locations with guyed towers: the primary Aguada transmission station in a 330-acre site; the Naval Radio Receiver at a 242-acre site at Campamento Santiago in Salinas, Puerto Rico ; and the Naval Radio Transmitter at a 408-acre site in Isabela County .  Only the tallest with a height of 367.3 metres (1205 ft) is still standing and in use., while the other two were dismantled. It is the tallest structure in Puerto Rico and in the Caribbean region.\\n\nCommunication with submarines\nThis transmission station emits signals below 50 kHz, being capable of penetrating ocean depths to approximately 200 metres. The United States Navy communicates with submarines on these frequencies.  \\n\nDue to the low frequency, a VLF broadcast antenna needs to be quite large. In fact, broadcasting sites are usually a few square kilometres. This prevents such antennas being installed on submarines. Submarines carry only a VLF reception aerial and do not respond on such low frequencies, so a ground-to-submarine VLF broadcast is always a one-way broadcast, originating on the ground and received aboard the boat. If two-way communication is needed, the boat must ascend to periscope depth (just below the surface) and raise a telescopic mast antenna to communicate on higher frequencies (such as HF , UHF , or VHF ).\\n\nBecause of the narrow bandwidth of this band, VLF radio signals cannot carry audio (voice), and can transmit text messages only at a slow data rate. VLF data transmission rates are around 300 bit/s – or about 35 eight-bit ASCII characters per second (or the equivalent of a sentence every two seconds) – a total of 450 words per minute. Simply shifting to 7 bit ASCII increases the number of transmitted characters per time unit by 14%. An additional shift to a 6 bit or a 5 bit code (such as the baudot code ) would result in speeds of more than 600 and 700 words per minute.\\n\nIn situations where GPS is denied to U.S. forces, VLF may be used to help provide position navigation and timing. The VLF stations, such as this in Puerto Rico, are in fixed locations. As part of a backup system, the VLF signals may be used to triangulate a user\\'s position on the globe, in much the same way a GPS receiver is used.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

It mainly consists of mangrove coasts, keys and floodplain forests, and it borders the Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve . The Aguirre State Forest is owned and administered by Puerto Rico . It was established in 1918 by Puerto Rico governor Arthur Yager to protect the mangrove forests areas between the municipalities of Guayama and Santa Isabel ( Punta Petrona ).  \\n\nNatural features\nThe state forest is named after the nearby Central Aguirre , a historic sugarcane plantation and refinery, and the barrio of Salinas of the same name . The forest is notable for its dense mangrove forests and salt ponds . As such it is an ecologically diverse area that is home to 13 species of reptiles, 4 species of amphibians and 3 species of bats. At least 184 bird species can be found within the forest and the area is an important bird nesting site. Some notable bird species found here are yellow-crowned night herons ( Nyctanassa violacea ), mangrove rails ( Rallus longirostris ), yellow warblers ( Setophaga petechia ), and endangered birds such as yellow-shouldered blackbirds ( Agelaius xanthomus) . Manatees can also be observed in the lagoons located in and around the forest.\\n\nThe types of mangroves found within the state forest are white mangrove ( Laguncularia racemosa ), black mangrove ( Avicennia germinans ), red mangrove ( Rhizophora mangle ) and buttonwood ( Conocarpus erectus ). Batis maritima , Sesuvium portulacastrum and Sporobolus virginicus are the main grass species found in the area, particularly around the tropical salt ponds and keys.  \\n\nRecreation\nThe forest is offers opportunities for bird watching, nature walks, camping and kayaking in designated areas.

Its population in 2010 was 3,539.    \\n\nAs was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.   \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n \\n\nLocated across from the central plaza in Aibonito barrio-pueblo is the Parroquia San José .  The first church found at this place was made of wood and built between the years 1825 and 1831. Construction on the current church began in 1887 and was based on an architectural design by Pedro Cobreros. Work stopped in 1888 and resumed in 1893. The church was finally inaugurated in 1897 and renovations have been made over the years.  \\n\nSectors\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nThe following sectors are in Aibonito barrio-pueblo:  \\n\nBarrio Pueblo Norte, Barrio Pueblo Sur , and Urbanización Buena Vista .\\n\nUrban development\nIn 2014, William Alicea Pérez , then mayor of Aibonito celebrated the improvements that had been made to Aibonito, specifically to its urban center. Several infrastructure projects were completed in 2014. An assisted living center was inaugurated, and a stadium. The mayor announced plans for a future gym, gave updates on progress of another stadium and other projects that were under way for the benefit of Aibonito. Pérez indicated that its urban center had been transformed and would continue to be improved upon. The construction of a gym for boxing and martial arts was underway with the help of Miguel Cotto , a Puerto Rican boxing champion.  \\n\nGallery\nPlaces in Aibonito barrio-pueblo:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

It focuses on psychology, health, education, and human services.\\n\nHistory\nThe university\\'s history began in 1966, when a Puerto Rican psychologist and educator, Carlos Albizu Miranda , founded the Instituto Psicológico de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology) in response to the need for culturally sensitive professional training in the area of clinical psychology . At the time, there were no graduate programs in clinical psychology in Puerto Rico. The University of Puerto Rico and the Normal School (later known as the College of Education) included psychology as part of the core curricula as early as 1903\\xe2\\x80\\x94but only for undergraduate studies that were heavily based on the American higher education system and its standards. Graduate-level degrees in psychology could only be obtained through schools in the United States.\\n\nBy the early 1960s, little had changed, with mental health professionals being trained abroad and then returning to their home country with the challenge of adapting what they had learned in the United States to fit the socio-cultural realities of a Hispanic community. Albizu-Miranda himself received his training at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana , and incurred the same difficulties of incorporating what he had learned into the culture of the island upon returning home to Puerto Rico.\\n\nWhat had changed, though, was the social climate of the island. Between 1947 and the late 1960s, Puerto Rico saw major industrialization that transformed the island from a rural agrarian to an urban industrial society. With this, came the establishment of social classes, modern capitalism, and economic consumption\\xe2\\x80\\x94along with confusion and insecurity that led to issues such as violence and drug use. By the 1960s, the population had grown to nearly three million people, with only five clinical psychologists on the island to support the growing need for social services.  In an effort to meet the public\\'s demands, the government established what were known as \"assistant psychologists.\" These assistant psychologists for the most part had had little training and were not equipped to serve what was becoming an increasingly complex population. By 1964, Albizu-Miranda had begun envisioning a Puerto Rican-based graduate program that would address the need for multicultural professional training in psychology on the island, along with the need for greater numbers of clinically trained psychologists to serve the growing population. [ citation needed ] \\n\nBetween 1964 and 1966, Albizu-Miranda held multiple meetings with the chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico to discuss the development of a graduate program in psychology. After two years of fruitless efforts, Albizu-Miranda decided to turn away from the state university and establish a self-governing and independent institution. On August 1, 1966, he incorporated the Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology and welcomed the institute\\'s inaugural academic year in 1967-1968.  \\n\nRecognizing a parallel need for multicultural training in clinical psychology in Southern Florida, which has a large Hispanic population, Albizu-Miranda opened the Miami Institute of Psychology in Miami, Florida , in 1980. In January 2000, the two main campuses were merged under the shared name Carlos Albizu University in honor of their founder. [ citation needed ] \\n\nCampuses\nAlbizu University has its main campus in San Juan, Puerto Rico; a branch campus in Miami, Florida; and an extension of the San Juan Campus in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico .\\n\nEach campus includes a clinic that offers mental health and speech and language services to the surrounding community while providing a practical training site for students.\\n\nLocated in the heart of Puerto Rico\\'s capital city, the San Juan Campus set a precedent as the first independent professional school of psychology in North America.  Originally called the Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology, Albizu-Miranda modeled the university after institutes of psychology in Europe where practice and internship coexisted. Now, over 50 years since its founding, the San Juan Campus has over 1,600 students and has expanded to include an on-campus training clinic.\\n\nAt the San Juan Campus, enrolled students for Fall 2019 included 483 undergraduates and 1,145 in graduate programs and postgraduate certificate programs. 93% of the students are from Puerto Rico and 7% are from other parts of the United States and its territories.\\n\nThe Albizu Clinic, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the university, provides mental health services to children, adolescents, and adults in San Juan and surrounding communities. The clinic also serves as a practicum and internship site for Albizu University graduate students. The Albizu Clinic Internship Training Program in Clinical Psychology is exclusively offered to Albizu students in the Psy.D. and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology programs. [ citation needed ] \\n\nThe Albizu Clinic also provides speech and language services for children and adults in the areas of autism, dysphagia, motor-speech disorders, neurological impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive disabilities, and developmental disorders. Graduate students from the university\\'s M.S. in Speech and Language Pathology program work closely with licensed and certified pathologists.\\n\nLocated in the Miami, Florida, metropolitan area, the Miami Campus offers an array of undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs in the fields of psychology, education, speech and language, English for speakers of other languages (ESOL), criminal justice, and human services.  \\n\nFounded in 1980, the Goodman Psychological Services Center is a private, nonprofit mental health center, sponsored by Albizu University, that provides services to children, adolescents, and adults in South Florida. The Goodman Center also functions as a practicum site for Albizu psychology and speech/language programs and for a doctorate in clinical psychology internship program accredited by the American Psychological Association. [ citation needed ] \\n\nSince its inception, the Goodman Center has provided care to nearly 15,000 people from communities that are typically underserved due to factors such as financial hardship, limited or no insurance coverage, and lack of proficiency in the English language. [ citation needed ] In addition, the Goodman Center is contracted by the Miami-Dade County Public Schools to conduct psychoeducational evaluations and receives referrals from community agencies and other sources. Services are provided in both English and Spanish. [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn January 2015, Albizu opened an extension location in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico . Under the jurisdiction of the San Juan Campus, the location was created to provide academic offerings and clinical services to the western region of Puerto Rico. Known as the Mayagüez University Center, the facility offers undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs in psychology and speech and language pathology. With an on-site clinic, the center also offers students clinical practice while providing health services to the community.

In 1990 it was restored by the Ponce Municipal Government,  and has since been used for high-ranking official municipal business. For example, it was here where the dinner to honor Prince of Asturias, His Majesty Felipe de Borbon , took place.  \\n\nHistory\nPonce had three casinos before this one. The first Casino de Ponce was founded in 1862, on Calle Marina. It met at the location that was later (in 1911) used by Rosendo Matienzo Cintron as his law office.  The organization stopped meeting due to political quarrels between the two political factions in its membership representing groups for and against the government of Spanish General Sanz, but it reformed on 19 July 1876.  This second Casino de Ponce was located on the second floor of the property owned by Don Carlos Cabrera Martinez, one of the distinguished members of the Ponce high society. Their meeting location was on an elegant structure at the northeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Cristina, facing Plaza Las Delicias . The third Casino de Ponce reformed on 29 June 1897.  It met next to Teatro La Perla , on the east side of Calle Mayor, between Calle Isabel and Calle Cristina, immediately north of the theater.  It moved 25 years later, in 1922, to the pompous locale at the southeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Luna, that is the subject of this article.\\n\nWhen built in 1922, under the sponsorship of Lucas P. Valdivieso,  it was actually the replacement quarters for Ponce\\'s exclusive club, the previous one having been destroyed by a hurricane.   In addition to its original use, the building has also served as postal office , a public health unit, tax collector \\'s office, and as a temporary city hall .  The building was designed by Agustin Camilo Gonzalez, and the artisan works were the product of Jose Cott, Victor Cott , and Camilo Gonzalez, Jr. Local painter Don Miguel Pou was responsible for the painted tapestries.  The building was restored in 1990.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe Old Casino de Ponce stands as a reminder of the wealthy aristocracy of southern Puerto Rico in the late 19th and early 20th century.  \\n\nFrom the architectural standpoint, the Old Casino is significant because in its structure the architect managed to incorporate the 19th century Second Empire , neo-Rococo and other architectural styles in concrete construction:\"It represents a transitional point from the brick and stucco classical Spanish traditional construction to the modern, reinforced-concrete technology of the United States.\"  \\n\nFrom a social and cultural standpoint, the Old Casino is significant in that it expresses to this day the lifestyle of the area\\'s wealthy families during the early decades of the 20th century. It is a reminder of how they lived and how World War II changed that lifestyle for ever. The lavish second floor ballroom was extensively used prior to WWII as the de facto meeting place for the most wealthy and influential families in Ponce and Puerto Rico. The Casino is associated with the social club that made the structure come to life, a club that has ceased to exist as today\\'s way of life have pushed aside the lifestyle of the aristocracy of yesterday.  \\n\nPhysical appearance\nThe Casino de Ponce is a two-story, concrete structure on the southeast corner of Marina and Luna streets in the historic urban center of Ponce . The area of the lot on which it sits measures approximately 38 X 36 meters. It has a chamfered corner at the intersection of the two streets. The architectural style is Rococo -like, including its main relief and mansard roof. Most of the building as it exists today is part of the original structure, the exception being a few of the ground level doors.  \\n\nThe building consists of three facades: a northern facade with five bays, a western facade with seven bays, and a single-bay chamfered facade at the intersection of the two other facades.\\n\nThe main entry to the building is via Bay 3 on the north facade at Luna Street. The architectural details on this facade are markedly Spanish- baroque . There is a frontispiece that includes Tuscan columns and pilasters supporting an architrave and blind-arch tympanum above. The spandrel and tympanum areas are terminated in highly detailed plaster reliefs. The other bays (1, 2, 4, and 5) on the northern facade consist of simpler, narrow, arch openings capped by hood-moulds and keystones .  \\n\nAt the upper level of the same facade, the three central bays are articulated as wide, square openings with Tuscan half-columns within, supporting the lintel at either extreme. Bays 1 and 5 are each articulated by a quoined surround and an angular pediment , supported by brackets and decorated with an ornamental relief tympanum.  \\n\nThe seven-bay Marina Street facade (the west facade) consists of an ABABA rhythm in which unit A is identical to bays 1 and 5 of the north facade. Unit B consists of ground-storey bays with wider, circular-arch openings and rectangular upper-level openings with quoined surrounds and voussoired lintels.  \\n\nThe single chamfered bay is particularly ornate, as it recesses slightly and then curves outward in a baroque fashion. At the ground floor, a wide, segmental arch opening with a hood-mould accesses secondary office space. At the upper level, a rectangular doorway is crowned by an intricate cameo with angel figures on either side of it. The upper level bay is framed by Tuscan columns which spring from a string-course at the baluster level and support a projection of the building cornice .  \\n\nThe entire composition is crowned by a cornice which follows the modulation of the facade. A balustered parapet above the cornice completes the composition. In addition, broken-scroll pediments above the parapet accentuate the composition\\'s rhythm at the central bay of the west facade, the extreme bays of both facades, and the corner chamfer. A \" mission -tile\" mansard roof completes the composition and accentuates the French influences of the design.  \\n\nIn plan, the main entrance at the north facade accesses directly an ample stairway which leads to the upper level. At this level two large rooms serve as ballrooms: a major open space along the west wall and a smaller reception area on the north. The ground level is currently utilized as office space by a government agency.  Access to these areas is through various doorways along the street wall.  All upper level bays open out onto individual balustered balconies , except for bays 2 and 3 and bays 5 and 6 of the west facade, which share wider, two-bay balconies. The chamfered bay contains a semi-elliptical balcony which smoothly turns the corner of the two facades.  \\n\nToday\nToday the entire first floor of the building accommodates offices of the Ponce municipal government. The Casino belongs to the people of the municipality of Ponce. The government promotes it as \"the ballroom of excellence in the southern region of Puerto Rico,\"  and the government makes it available for social and business events.  \\n\nEvent facilities are all located on the second floor.  Access to the second floor facilities is via a wide wooden stairway accessible from the Luna street facade.  The second-floor Casino facilities include four main rooms. The Felices Dias ballroom is the largest at 70\\' x 40.5\\', and it faces west. It accommodates 300 people. The Impromptu Room faces north and is located next to the bar.  It is commonly used as the buffet dinner food area. The third room, Tu y Yo (English: You and I), and informally known as the Blue Room for the color on its walls, faces south and is used only for events consisting of more than 150 guests. The chamfered corner of the building has a smaller, more intimate room than the others, appropriately called The Chamfered Room . It has five doors, including three interior doors plus two exterior doors including the chamfered door.  \\n\nOther second floor facilities are the kitchen, bar, restrooms, a 16\\' x 16\\' balcony and a south-facing terrace .  Casino guests also have access to a spacious courtyard on the ground floor featuring a central water fountain.  Access to the first floor courtyard is either from a street entrance on Luna street, via an open exterior second-floor stairway that leads directly to the courtyard, or via the elevator, which opens to the exterior, but covered, hallway next to the courtyard.  \\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nAntiguo Cuartel Militar Español de Ponce\n\\n\nThe Antiguo Cuartel Militar Español de Ponce or \"El Castillo\" (English: Old Spanish Military Headquarters in Ponce or \"The Castle\" ) is the only structure directly related to the events of the land defense of Puerto Rico during the 1898 American invasion of the Island.  The historic building dates from 1894 [ a ] and is located on Calle Castillo in Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the city\\'s historic district . The structure was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 14 May 1987.\\n\nHistory\n\" El Castillo \", as this building is commonly known, was built in 1894 by the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers as general headquarters for the Spanish military garrison stationed in Ponce. Since 1898, when Puerto Rico became a possession of the United States , this structure has served various purposes, first as courthouse and later as district jailhouse . It was being used as a district jail house in 1987.  In the late 1980s, it ceased to be used as a district jail, was reconditioned, and in 1992 it was inaugurated as the headquarters of the Ponce School of Fine Arts, which is its role.\\n\nThe building was designed by the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers. The architecture consists of 19th Century Civil Architecture. It is one of the largest Neoclassic Isabelino civil architecture structures built in Ponce during the 19th century. Its sober exterior walls help express its intended original use. The building played a significant role in law enforcement during the last years of the Spanish colonial rule for southern Puerto Rico and has played a significant role for both law enforcement and judicial purposes since then.\\n\nSignificance\nThe Spanish garrison stationed in Ponce at the time of the arrival of the American troops in 1898 played a significant role in the defense of the island. While the Spanish commander in charge of the Ponce garrison had determined it was not possible to defend the city of Ponce from the American advance at the time, the Ponce troops, together with the aid of other smaller garrisons, held the Asomante area preventing the U.S. Army from invading Aibonito in their advance to the conquest of fortified areas of San Juan . The Ponce garrison also helped the Guayama garrison in its attempt to detain American troops from taking that city. \"This is the only structure directly related to these [land] events that has been identified to date\".  \\n\nDescription\nThe building consists of a two level square structure with an interior courtyard . It is built in brick and stone masonry; timber beams and brick layers were used for the roof and floors. The interior courtyard is surrounded by open-arched galleries in both levels. During the time when the building was being used as a district jail in 1987, the galleries provided the foundation of the jail barracks.  \\n\nA repetition of windows over the facade\\'s plane without any ornament gives the building an austere appearance, typical of military architecture developed during the Spanish period in Puerto Rico. The building still preserves its original lead gutters in the form of cannons . The building has been altered little since its original construction.  The most significant alteration has been the replacement of the original wooden louvers windows with metal louvered windows. Also, iron bars have been added to its interior openings. The building has also been upgraded in two rather minimal ways: the interior courtyard was repaved and modern sanitary facilities were installed.  \\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nAntiguo Hospital Militar Español de Ponce\n\\n\nThe Antiguo Hospital Militar Español de Ponce (English: Old Spanish Military Hospital in Ponce ) is a historic building in Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the city\\'s historic district . The building dates from 1896 or 1897.  It was designed by the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers. The architecture consists of 19th Neoclassical architecture style. The building is of architectural significance since it is the only one-story building of this style remaining in the city of Ponce and one of the best examples on the Island.  Completed in 1897, the year before the Spanish-American War of 1898, this building was the last major construction undergone by the Spanish Government in the Americas.  From 1905 to the mid 1970s the structure served as the Asilo de Ciegos de Ponce (Ponce Blind Asylum). As of 2020 the building sits abandoned.\\n\nHistory\nThe structure commonly known as the Asilo de Ciegos (Home of the Blind) was built between 1896 and 1897 to serve as hospital for the city of Ponce\\'s military garrison. The Royal Spanish Engineering Corps constructed this building in the then popular neoclassic style which was common to the old San Juan area, but was not at the time prevalent in Ponce. This building, together with El Castillo ( Ponce\\'s Spanish military headquarters ), Hospital Tricoche (Ponce\\'s Municipal Hospital), and the Casa Alcaldía are the only remaining buildings representative of the Spanish Crown\\'s interest in other areas of the Island besides San Juan.  \\n\nOn 1 October 1905, the structure was re-inaugurated as Asilo de Ciegos de Ponce (Ponce Blind Asylum) to serve as the home for the blind adults in the city.  It operated as a home for the blind until the mid 1970s, when it was closed.  It had room to house 95 residents and, in the early 1910s, had an regular occupancy of 80. As a home for the blind it sought provide medical assistance to its residents, including ophthalmic surgery. Dr. Guillermo Vives performed numerous successful surgeries on its residents, restoring eyesight to approximately 95% of its patients.  The institution sought to teach the blind skills to become independent citizens, and permanent housing was provided to those who could not care for themselves.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe building is of architectural significance since it is the only one-story building of this style remaining in the city of Ponce and one of the best examples in the Island.  \\n\nThe hospital served the military community stationed in Ponce and in the southern region and could be used by the civilian population in case of emergencies and natural disasters , thus solving a social need in the southern part of the Island.  \\n\nIn 1905, this property was given to the state government to be used as an asylum for the blind. It gave shelter to the many poor blind in the south. Here they were taught skills that could help them support themselves in the future. In other instances those who could not be rehabilitated were given a home and free meals thus keeping them from the streets where they could be in danger. The social functions carried out in this building continued until the mid-1970s when the structure was closed. The people of Ponce consider this structure to be important to the community\\'s history for its role as hospital and asylum.  \\n\nPhysical appearance and description\nThis one story building is a very good example of Neoclassic style in Ponce and the only one single-story building in the area. It preserves its simple lines typical of the 19th century institutional or military construction in the Island. Contributing elements to the style are its massive and sober exterior elements consisting of wide walls and pilasters crowned with tuscan order capitols, planar window surrounds, and a set of steps giving access to the main portico which projects form the main facade. A simple cornice crowns the building in all facades. Series of arched windows originally closed by wood louvers and glass panel transomes, complete the facade (these windows were replaced with metal blinds in the mid-1960s and have been vandalized in recent years).  \\n\nThe main entrance is highlighted by a projecting portico of attractive proportions. It has a main central arch flanked by smaller ones to the sides. These arches and the other two lateral ones are ornamented with tuscan order pilasters. Four tuscan order pilasters, a simple frieze, cornice, and parapet complete the portico\\'s decoration giving it the appearance of being slightly taller than the rest of the building.  \\n\nThe structure was erected around a rectangular central patio with arched galleries on all sides that serve as transitional elements to the office and room areas located throughout its periphery, all of which are typical of the period and style. A small fountain in the center of the patio served the dual purposes of ornamentation and water supply. This element no longer exists. The building was constructed of brick and a mixture of rubblework and stone. A series of symmetrically-placed thick walls carrying wooden beams, probably of ausubo or other Puerto Rican hard wood, support the brick roof. This structure has a basement, an uncommon element in this type of construction, on its south side.  \\n\nMany of the windows and parts of the roof as well as many wooden parts have been vandalized in recent years since the structure has not been in use. However, the main structural and ornamental elements of the building are in good shape or could be restored.  The structure is not currently in use nor accessible to the public.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nArecibo Observatory\n\\n\nThe Arecibo Observatory , also known as the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center ( NAIC ) and formerly known as the Arecibo Ionosphere Observatory , is an observatory in Barrio Esperanza , Arecibo, Puerto Rico owned by the US National Science Foundation (NSF).\\n\nThe observatory\\'s main instrument was the Arecibo Telescope , a 305 m (1,000 ft) spherical reflector dish built into a natural sinkhole , with a cable-mount steerable receiver and several radar transmitters for emitting signals mounted 150 m (492 ft) above the dish. Completed in 1963, it was the world\\'s largest single-aperture telescope for 53 years, surpassed in July 2016 by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China. Following two breaks in cables supporting the receiver platform in mid-2020, the NSF decommissioned the telescope. A full collapse of the telescope occurred on December 1, 2020, before either repairs or controlled demolition could be conducted. In 2022, the NSF announced the telescope will not be rebuilt, with an educational facility to be established on the site.\\n\nThe observatory also includes a smaller radio telescope , a LIDAR facility, and a visitor center, which remained operational after the telescope\\'s collapse.   The asteroid 4337 Arecibo is named after the observatory by Steven J. Ostro , in recognition of the observatory\\'s contributions to the characterization of Solar System bodies.  \\n\nHistory\nAs part of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) missile defense program, ARPA had sought a means to try to detect incoming missiles while they traveled through the ionosphere . On November 6, 1959, Cornell University entered into a contract with ARPA to carry out development studies for a large-scale ionospheric radar probe.  The Arecibo Telescope was funded as a means to study Earth\\'s ionosphere for this purpose, and serving a dual-use as a general-purpose radio telescope . Construction of the telescope and its supporting facilities were started in September of 1960, with the telescope operational by 1963. The telescope and supporting observatory were formally opened as the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory on November 1, 1963.  \\n\nOwnership of the observatory transferred from the DoD to the National Science Foundation on October 1, 1969. NSF named Cornell University to manage the observatory\\'s functions. By September 1971, NSF renamed the observatory as the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) and had made it a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC).  NASA began contributing towards funding of the observatory alongside NSF as to support its planetary radar mission.  \\n\nIn the early 2000s, NASA started to reduce their contribution to the Arecibo Observatory, putting more pressure on NSF to continue to fund the facility.  In 2006, NSF made its first possible suggestion of significantly reducing its funding towards Arecibo and potentially decommissioning the observatory.  Academics and politicians lobbied to increase funding bookmarked for Arecibo to stave off its closure, and NASA recommitted funding in 2011 for study of near-earth objects .  To further cut losses, in 2011 NSF delisted Arecibo as a FFRDC, removed Cornell as the site operator, and replaced them with a collaborative team led by SRI International , which allowed the observatory to be able to offer its facilities to a wider range of projects.  \\n\nDamage to the telescope from Hurricane Maria in 2017 led NSF again to consider the possibility of decommissioning the observatory as the costs of maintaining it had become too great.  A consortium led by the University of Central Florida (UCF) stepped forward to offer to manage the observatory and cover a significant portion of the operations and maintenance costs, and in 2018, NSF made UCF\\'s consortium the new site operators,   though no specific actions were announced.\\n\nAfter an auxiliary and main cable failure on the telescope in August and November 2020, respectively, the NSF announced the decision that they would decommission the telescope through controlled demolition, but that the other facilities on the observatory would remain operational in the future. Before the safe decommission of the telescope could occur, remaining support cables from one tower rapidly failed in the morning of December 1, 2020, causing the instrument platform to crash through the dish, shearing off the tops of the support towers, and partially damaging some of the other buildings, though there were no injuries.  NSF stated in 2020 that it was their intention to have the other observatory facilities operational as soon as possible and were looking at plans to rebuild a new telescope instrument in its place.  In 2022, the NSF announced the telescope will not be rebuilt, with an educational facility to be established on the site.  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York; the University of Maryland, Baltimore County ; the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus in San Juan; and the University of the Sacred Heart , also in San Juan were selected by NSF in 2023 to set up and run an education center called Arecibo C3 (Arecibo Center for Culturally Relevant and Inclusive Science Education, Computational Skills, and Community Engagement).  \\n\nFacilities\nThe observatory\\'s main feature was its large radio telescope , whose main collecting dish was an inverted spherical dome 1,000 feet (305 m) in diameter with an 869-foot (265 m) radius of curvature ,  constructed inside a karst sinkhole .  The dish\\'s surface was made of 38,778 perforated aluminum panels, each about 3 by 7 feet (1 by 2 m), supported by a mesh of steel cables.  The ground beneath supported shade-tolerant vegetation.  \\n\nSince its completion in November 1963, the Telescope had been used for radar astronomy and radio astronomy , and had been part of the Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) program. It was also used by NASA for Near-Earth object detection. Since around 2006, NSF funding support for the telescope had waned as the Foundation directed funds to newer instruments, though academics petitioned to the NSF and Congress to continue support for the telescope. Numerous hurricanes, including Hurricane Maria , had damaged parts of the telescope, straining the reduced budget.\\n\nTwo cable breaks, one in August 2020 and a second in November 2020, threatened the structural integrity of the support structure for the suspended platform and damaged the dish. The NSF determined in November 2020 that it was safer to decommission the telescope rather than to try to repair it, but the telescope collapsed before a controlled demolition could be carried out. The remaining support cables from one tower failed around 7:56 a.m. local time on December 1, 2020, causing the receiver platform to fall into the dish and collapsing the telescope.   \\n\nNASA led an extensive failure investigation and reported the findings,  along with a technical bulletin with industry recommendations.  The investigation concluded that \"a combination of low socket design margin and a high percentage of sustained loading revealed an unexpected vulnerability to zinc creep and environments, resulting in long-term cumulative damage and progressive zinc/wire failure\".\\n\nThe Arecibo Observatory also has other facilities beyond the main telescope, including a 12-meter (39 ft) radio telescope intended for very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) with the main telescope;  and a LIDAR facility  whose research has continued since the main telescope\\'s collapse.\\n\nOpened in 1997, the \\xc3\\x81ngel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center features interactive exhibits and displays about the operations of the radio telescope, astronomy and atmospheric sciences .  The center is named after the financial foundation that honors \\xc3\\x81ngel Ramos , owner of the El Mundo newspaper and founder of Telemundo . The Foundation provided half of the funds to build the Visitor Center, with the remainder received from private donations and Cornell University .\\n\nThe center, in collaboration with the Caribbean Astronomical Society,  hosts a series of Astronomical Nights throughout the year, which feature diverse discussions regarding exoplanets , astronomical phenomena, and discoveries (such as Comet ISON ). The purposes of the center are to increase public interest in astronomy, the observatory\\'s research successes, and space endeavors.\\n\nList of directors\nSource(s):  [ additional citation(s) needed ] \\n\n\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nhttps://blogs.iu.edu/sciu/2021/07/03/arecibos-50-years-of-discoveries/ \\n\nExternal links"

A cable-mount steerable receiver and several radar transmitters for emitting signals were mounted 150 m (492 ft) above the dish . Completed in November 1963, the Arecibo Telescope was the world\\'s largest single-aperture telescope for 53 years, until it was surpassed in July 2016 by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in Guizhou , China .\\n\nThe Arecibo Telescope was primarily used for research in radio astronomy , atmospheric science , and radar astronomy , as well as for programs that search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). Scientists wanting to use the observatory submitted proposals that were evaluated by independent scientific referees. NASA also used the telescope for near-Earth object detection programs . The observatory, funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with partial support from NASA, was managed by Cornell University from its completion in 1963 until 2011, after which it was transferred to a partnership led by SRI International . In 2018, a consortium led by the University of Central Florida assumed operation of the facility.\\n\nThe telescope\\'s unique and futuristic design led to several appearances in film, gaming and television productions, such as for the climactic fight scene in the James Bond film GoldenEye (1995). It is one of the 116 pictures included in the Voyager Golden Record . It has been listed on the US National Register of Historic Places since 2008.   The telescope was named an IEEE Milestone in 2001.  \\n\nThe NSF reduced its funding commitment to the observatory from 2006, leading academics to push for additional funding support to continue its programs. The telescope was damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and was affected by earthquakes in 2019 and 2020. Two cable breaks, one in August 2020 and a second in November 2020, threatened the structural integrity of the support structure for the suspended platform and damaged the dish. Due to uncertainty over the remaining strength of the other cables supporting the suspended structure, and the risk of collapse owing to further failures making repairs dangerous, the NSF announced on November 19, 2020, that the telescope would be decommissioned and dismantled, with the LIDAR facility remaining operational.    Before it could be decommissioned, several of the remaining support cables suffered a critical failure and the support structure, antenna, and dome assembly all fell into the dish at 7:55 a.m. local time on December 1, 2020, destroying the telescope.   The NSF decided in October 2022 that it would not rebuild the telescope or build a similar observatory at the site.\\n\nGeneral information\nThe telescope\\'s main collecting dish had the shape of a spherical cap 1,000 feet (305 m) in diameter with an 869-foot (265 m) radius of curvature ,  and was constructed inside a karst sinkhole .  The dish surface was made of 38,778 perforated aluminum panels, each about 3 by 7 feet (1 by 2 m), supported by a mesh of steel cables.  The ground beneath supported shade-tolerant vegetation.  \\n\nThe telescope had three radar transmitters, with effective isotropic radiated powers (EIRPs) of 22 TW (continuous) at 2380 MHz,  3.2 TW (pulse peak) at 430 MHz, and 200 MW at 47 MHz,  as well as an ionospheric modification facility operating at 5.1 and 8.175 MHz.  \\n\nThe dish remained stationary, while receivers and transmitters were moved to the proper focal point of the telescope to aim at the desired target.  As a spherical mirror, the reflector\\'s focus was along a line rather than at one point. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations, with each line feed covering a narrow frequency band measuring 10-45 MHz. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope\\'s flexibility.  \\nThe receiver was on an 820-tonne (900-short-ton) platform suspended 150 m (492 ft) above the dish by 18 main cables running from three reinforced concrete towers (six cables per tower), one 111 m (365 ft) high and the other two 81 m (265 ft) high, placing their tops at the same elevation.  Each main cable was a 8 cm (3.1 in) diameter bundle containing 160 wires, with the bundle painted over and dry air continuously blown through to prevent corrosion due to the humid tropic climate.  The platform had a rotating, bow-shaped track 93 m (305 ft) long, called the azimuth arm, carrying the receiving antennas and secondary and tertiary reflectors. This allowed the telescope to observe any region of the sky in a forty-degree cone of visibility about the local zenith (between −1 and 38 degrees of declination ). Puerto Rico \\'s location near the Northern Tropic allowed the Arecibo telescope to view the planets in the Solar System over the northern half of their orbit. The round trip light time to objects beyond Saturn is longer than the 2.6-hour time that the telescope could track a celestial position, preventing radar observations of more distant objects.   \\n\nHistory\nThe origins of the observatory trace to late 1950s efforts to develop anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defenses as part of the newly formed United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) ABM umbrella-effort, Project Defender. Even at this early stage it was clear that the use of radar decoys would be a serious problem at the long ranges needed to successfully attack a warhead, ranges on the order of 1,600 km (1,000 mi).   \\n\nAmong the many Defender projects were several studies based on the concept that a re-entering nuclear warhead would cause unique physical signatures while still in the upper atmosphere. It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects radar waves, and it appeared that a warhead\\'s signature would be different enough from decoys that a detector could pick out the warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional tracking radar on the single return from the warhead.   \\n\nAlthough the concept appeared to offer a solution to the tracking problem, there was almost no information on either the physics of re-entry or a strong understanding of the normal composition of the upper layers of the ionosphere . ARPA began to address both simultaneously. To better understand the radar returns from a warhead, several radars were built on Kwajalein Atoll , while Arecibo started with the dual purpose of understanding the ionosphere\\'s F-layer while also producing a general-purpose scientific radio observatory.   \\n\nOn November 6, 1959, Cornell University entered into a contract with ARPA to carry out development studies for a large-scale ionospheric radar probe, exploring how this instrument could also be utilized in radio astronomy and other scientific areas.  The observatory was built between mid-1960 and November 1963. William E. Gordon and George Peter of Cornell University oversaw its design for study of the Earth\\'s ionosphere .     He was attracted to the sinkholes in the karst regions of Puerto Rico that offered perfect cavities for a very large dish.    Originally, a fixed parabolic reflector was envisioned, pointing in a fixed direction with a 150 m (492 ft) tower to hold equipment at the focus. This design would have limited its use in other research areas, such as radar astronomy , radio astronomy and atmospheric science, which require the ability to point at different positions in the sky and track those positions for an extended time as the Earth rotates.\\n\nWard Low of the ARPA pointed out this flaw and put Gordon in touch with the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory (AFCRL) in Boston, Massachusetts , where one group headed by Phil Blacksmith was working on spherical reflectors and another group was studying the propagation of radio waves in and through the upper atmosphere. Cornell University proposed the project to ARPA in mid-1958 and a contract was signed between the AFCRL and the University in November 1959. Cornell University and Zachary Sears published a request for proposals (RFP) asking for a design to support a feed moving along a spherical surface 133 metres (435 ft) above the stationary reflector. The RFP suggested a tripod or a tower in the center to support the feed. On the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna was announced at Cornell University, Gordon had also envisioned a 133 m (435 ft) tower centered in the 305 m (1,000 ft) reflector to support the feed.    \\n\nGeorge Doundoulakis , who directed research at the General Bronze Corporation in Garden City, New York , along with Zachary Sears, who directed Internal Design at Digital B & E Corporation, New York, received the RFP from Cornell University for the antenna design and studied the idea of suspending the feed with his brother, Helias Doundoulakis , a civil engineer . George Doundoulakis identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, (the most important area of the reflector), and devised a better design by suspending the feed.   He presented his proposal to Cornell University for a doughnut or torus -type truss suspended by four cables from four towers above the reflector, having along its edge a rail track for the azimuthal truss positioning. This second truss, in the form of an arc, or arch , was to be suspended below, which would rotate on the rails through 360 degrees. The arc also had rails on which the unit supporting the feed would move for the feed\\'s elevational positioning. A counterweight would move symmetrically opposite to the feed for stability and, if a hurricane struck, the whole feed could be raised and lowered. Helias Doundoulakis designed the cable suspension system which was finally adopted. The final configuration was substantially the same as in the original drawings by George and Helias Doundoulakis, although with three towers, instead of the four drawn in the patent, which was granted to Helias Doundoulakis by the U.S. Patent office .   \\n\nThe suspended structure was designed by Dr. Thomas C. Kavanagh , Fred Severud , and Dr. Hans Bandel, who were selected after the 1959 RFP issued by Cornell University. A proposal by the General Bronze Corporation was not selected as it did not meet specifications, according to an editorial response by Donald Cooke (Cornell\\'s spokesperson) to Helias Doundoulakis in a newsletter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ). Cooke stated that Doundoulakis used an incorrect feed/paraxial surface measurement. However, the measurement Cooke used was from Doundoulakis' patent issued in 1966, and not from the 1959 RFP meetings which predated the patent by seven years.   Furthermore, proposal measurements presented by George Doundoulakis and Helias Doundoulakis at the RFP meeting on December 10, 1959, were not referenced in Cooke\\'s editorial response.  The originators of this proposal subsequently filed a dispute, originally for $1.2 million but was settled for $10,000 because \"the defense in a court trial would cost far more than the $10,000 for which the case was settled,\" and accordingly, on April 11, 1975, Doundoulakis v. U.S. (Case 412-72) had been ruled in plaintiff\\'s favor by the United States Court of Federal Claims , that \"(a) a judgment has been entered in favor of the plaintiffs ( Helias Doundoulakis , William J. Casey , and Constantine Michalos) against the United States and (b) in consideration of the sum of $10,000 to be paid by the United States Government to the plaintiff, the plaintiffs grants to the United States Government an irrevocable, fully-paid, non-exclusive license under the aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 3, 273, 156 to Cornell University.\"  \\n\nThe idea of a spherical reflecting mirror with a steerable secondary has since been used in optical telescopes, in particular, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope  \\n\nConstruction began in mid-1960, with the telescope operational about three years later. The telescope\\'s and the supporting observatory\\'s official opening as the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory (AIO) was held on November 1, 1963.   \\n\nSince its construction, the telescope was upgraded several times, following the facility\\'s oversight from the DoD to the National Science Foundation on October 1, 1969, and subsequent renaming of the AIO to the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) in September 1971.   Initially, when the maximum expected operating frequency was about 500 MHz, the surface consisted of half-inch galvanized wire mesh laid directly on the support cables. In 1973, a high-precision surface consisting of 38,000 individually adjustable aluminum panels replaced the old wire mesh,  and the highest usable frequency rose to about 5000 MHz. A Gregorian reflector system was installed in 1997, incorporating secondary and tertiary reflectors to focus radio waves at one point. This allowed installing a suite of receivers, covering the full 1-10 GHz range, that could be easily moved to the focal point , giving Arecibo more flexibility. The additional instrumentation added 270-tonne (300-short-ton) to the platform, so six additional support cables were added, two for each tower.  A metal mesh screen was also installed around the perimeter to block the ground\\'s thermal radiation from reaching the feed antennas. As part of this upgrade the power of the 2380 MHz transmitter was doubled to 1 MW by adding a second Klystron tube and improving the design.  Finally, in 2013 with a grant of US$2.5 million , work for adding the ionospheric modification HF facility began which was completed in 2015. The HF facility consisted on the sender side of six foldable 100 kW crossed dipoles inside the main dish and a hanging 100m wide subreflector mesh between the dish and platform.   \\n\nThe Astronomical Sciences and Atmospheric Sciences divisions of the NSF had financially supported Arecibo since its completion in the 1970s, with incremental support by NASA, for operating the planetary radar.  In 2001 NASA announced a rampdown and elimination of its support of the planetary radar by 2005.  \\n\nIn 2002, after several years of discussion, the US Congress passed a bill to double the NSF budget, and instructed the NSF to begin new projects.  As a result, the NSF began committing to major projects. However, the funding increase never arrived and the NSF was left with the new commitments. In 2005 the Astronomical Sciences division commissioned a \"Senior Review\" of its facilities to deal with its increasingly constrained budget. The Senior Review report released in November 2006 \"regretfully\" recommended substantially decreased astronomy funding for the Arecibo Observatory, beginning with a cut to US$10.5 million in 2007 and continuing to decrease to US$4.0 million in 2011. The report further stated that if other sources of funding could not be found, closure of the Observatory was recommended.   \\n\nAcademics and researchers responded by organizing to protect and advocate for the observatory. They established the Arecibo Science Advocacy Partnership (ASAP) in 2008, to advance the scientific excellence of Arecibo Observatory research and to publicize its accomplishments in astronomy, aeronomy and planetary radar as to seek additional funding support for the observatory.  An additional US$3 million in bonds were issued by the government of Puerto Rico to fund the Observatory, which were used to modernize power generation and improve other aging infrastructure.   Academics, media and influential politicians pressured the United States Congress on the importance of the work of the observatory.   led to additional US$3.1 million in funding to support Arecibo in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 . This was used for basic maintenance and for a second, much smaller, antenna to be used for very long baseline interferometry , new Klystron amplifiers for the planetary radar system and student training.  \\n\nArecibo\\'s budget from NSF continued to wane in the following years.   Starting in FY2010, NASA restored its historical support by contributing $2.0 million per year for planetary science , particularly the study of near-Earth objects , at Arecibo. NASA implemented this funding through its Near Earth Object Observations program.  NASA increased its support to $3.5 million per year in 2012.\\n\nIn 2011, NSF removed Cornell University , which had managed the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) since the 1970s, as the operator and transferred these responsibilities to SRI International , along with two other managing partners, Universities Space Research Association and Universidad Metropolitana de Puerto Rico , with a number of other collaborators.   NSF also decertified NAIC as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) , which the NSF said would give NAIC greater freedom to establish broader scientific partnerships and pursue funding opportunities for activities beyond the scope of those supported by NSF,   but which would also remove the FFRDC \\'s promise of stability intended to retain the very best technical staff.\\n\nWhile the Observatory continued to operate under the reduced NSF budget and NASA funds, NSF signaled in 2015 and 2016 that it was looking towards potential decommissioning of the Observatory by initiating environmental impact statements on the effect of disassembling the unit.  The NSF continued to indicate it would like to reduce funding to the Observatory in the short term.   As in 2008, academics expressed their concern over the loss of scientific discoveries that could occur should the Observatory be shut down.  \\n\nSeveral hurricanes and storms over the 2010s had raised the concerns of structural engineers over the stability of the observatory.  On September 21, 2017, high winds associated with Hurricane Maria caused the 430 MHz line feed to break and fall onto the primary dish, damaging roughly 30 of the 38,000 aluminum panels. Most Arecibo observations did not use the line feed but instead relied on the feeds and receivers located in the dome. Overall, the damage inflicted by Maria was minimal,     but it further clouded the observatory\\'s future. Restoring all the previous capabilities required more than the observatory\\'s already-threatened operating budget, and users feared the decision would be made to decommission it instead.  \\n\nA consortium consisting of the University of Central Florida (UCF), Yang Enterprises and UMET , came forward to supply funding in February 2018 to allow the NSF to reduce its contribution towards Arecibo\\'s operating costs from $8 million to $2 million from the fiscal year 2022-2023, thus securing the observatory\\'s future.  With this, the UCF consortium were named the new operators of the observatory in 2018.   \\n\nOn August 10, 2020, an auxiliary platform support cable separated from Tower 4, causing damage to the telescope, including a 100 ft (30 m) gash in the reflector dish.   Damage included six to eight panels in the Gregorian dome, and to the platform used to access the dome. No one was reported to have been hurt by the partial collapse. The facility was closed as damage assessments were made.  \\n\nThe facility had recently reopened following the passing of Tropical Storm Isaias . It was unclear if the cable failure was caused by Isaias. Former Arecibo Observatory director Robert Kerr stated that prior to the 1997 installation of the Gregorian dome, the main support cables and support towers had been engineered with a safety factor of two, as to be able to sustain twice the weight of the platform. When the dome was added in 1997, the auxiliary cables were intended to retain the safety factor of two once all design factors were considered, but Kerr believed that that was never the case as evenly distributing the loads following that install would be difficult to do.  Kerr also stated that there had been periods of neglect at the Observatory, during which the fans that were used to blow dry air along the wire bundles were not operating. The earlier storms would have brought seawater to the cables which could accelerate the rate of corrosion as well, according to Kerr.  Engineering firms hired by UCF inspected the socket area where the cable had failed, and found a similar problem that had been observed in the 1980s during a routine cable replacement, in which the use of molten zinc to affix the cable to the socket mount at the tower was not complete, allowing moisture to get into the wire bundle and cause corrosion and leading to the cable slipping from its socket.  The firms had developed models of the telescope that showed that the safety factor for Tower 4 had dropped to 1.67, believing that the structure was still safe while repairs could be effected, even if another cable collapsed.  Plans were made to replace all six auxiliary cables since their socket welds were all considered suspect at a cost of US$10.5 million .  \\n\nBefore repairs could be started, on November 7, 2020, one of the two main support cables from Tower 4 snapped, shattering part of the dish itself as it fell.  The UCF engineering staff, which had been monitoring the cables with support from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , and the engineering firms they had hired previously evaluated the remaining cables from Tower 4. One engineering firm proposed stabilization efforts,  while another suggested that they try to sever parts of the instrument platform such as the Gregorian dome to reduce the load.  The third firm made the determination that there was no way to safely repair the damage at this point, as the remaining cables could be suspect, and furthermore that a controlled decommissioning of the telescope was the only effective means to avoid catastrophic failure which would threaten the other buildings on campus.  The NSF took this advice and made the announcement on November 19, 2020 that they would decommission Arecibo over the following few weeks after determining the safest route to do so with a safety exclusion zone immediately put in place.  NSF\\'s Sean Jones stated, \"This decision is not an easy one for NSF to make, but safety of people is our number one priority.\" The lidar facility will remain operational.   \\n\nWhile waiting for NSF to make the decommissioning plans, steps had been taken to try to reduce the load that each of the towers were carrying, including reducing the strain on the backstay support cables for the individual towers. Other plans, such as having helicopters hoisting part of the load while hovering above the telescope, were proposed but deemed too risky.  Engineers from UCF had been monitoring the telescope and observed that wires in the backstay cables for the support towers had been breaking at a rate of one or two a day, and estimated that the telescope would soon collapse.  In the weekend prior to December 1, 2020, wire strands in the receiver\\'s supporting cables had also been snapping apart at a rapid rate, according to \\xc3\\x81ngel Vázquez, the director of operations. This culminated in the collapse of the receiver platform at around 6:55 a.m. AST (10:55 UTC) on December 1, 2020, as the second main cable from Tower 4 failed with the other two remaining support cables failing moments later. The collapse of the receiver structure and cables onto the dish caused extensive additional damage.    As the receiver fell, it also sheared the tips of the towers which the support cables ran through. Once the main cables from Tower 4 released, the backstay cables, which normally balanced the horizontal component of force from the main cables, pulled the tower outwards and broke off the top. The other two towers, once the force of supporting the platform was released, also had their tips sheared off due to the backstay cable tension.  The top of Tower 12 caused some structural damage to other buildings on the observatory as it fell. No injuries from the collapse were reported.    \\n\nIn the weeks following Arecibo\\'s collapse, the administration of the Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China, which had drawn some design principles from Arecibo, stated that they would start taking applications for international researchers to use the telescope starting in 2021.  \\n\nIn late December 2020, Wanda Vázquez Garced , then governor of Puerto Rico signed an executive order for $8 million for the removal of debris and for the design of a new observatory to be built in its place. The governor stated reconstruction of the observatory is a \"matter of public policy\". The executive order also designated the area as a history site.  \\n\nAs required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 , the NSF sent a report to Congress in March 2022 \"on the causes and extent of the damage, the plan to remove debris in a safe and environmentally sound way, the preservation of the associated [Arecibo Observatory] facilities and surrounding areas, and the process for determining whether to establish comparable technology at the site, along with any associated cost estimates\".   On March 25, 2022, a survey salvage committee formed by UCF and the NSF issued a final report, identifying materials from the site that may be salvaged for their \"historic importance or scientific utility.\"  \\n\nA team from the University of Texas at Austin was able to completely recover and back up the 3 petabytes of data that the telescope had captured since opening in the 1960s by May 2021 before further harm could come to the storage equipment. The data was relocated to the school\\'s servers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center to be made available for continued research.  \\n\nAn early plan developed by NSF scientists suggest one possible replacement called the Next Generation Arecibo Telescope, using 1000 closely-packed 9-meter (30 ft) telescopes mounted on one or more flat plate(s) that would cover the 300-meter (980 ft) width of the Arecibo sinkhole. While the telescopes themselves would be fixed, the plate(s) would be able to be rotated more than 45° off the horizontal in any direction. This would allow the new instrument to have 500 times the field of view of the original Arecibo Telescope, and be twice as sensitive with four times the radar power. It was expected this would cost roughly US$450 million to build.  This would enable better study of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way as a prime target.  \\n\nNSF decided in October 2022 that the Arecibo site would not be used for a new telescope, instead converting the site to be a STEM educational center.  \\n\nThe Arecibo Salvage Survey committee preserved some parts of the telescope, including parts of the zenith and azimuth tracks, a corner of the platform, the rotary joint, and the cable car.  \\n\nResearch and discoveries\nMany scientific discoveries were made with the observatory. On April 7, 1964, soon after it began operating, Gordon Pettengill \\'s team used it to determine that the rotation period of Mercury was not 88 days, as formerly thought, but only 59 days.  In 1968, the discovery of the periodicity of the Crab Pulsar (33 milliseconds) by Richard V. E. Lovelace and others provided the first solid evidence that neutron stars exist.  In 1974, Hulse and Taylor discovered the first binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 ,  an accomplishment for which they later received the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1982, the first millisecond pulsar , PSR B1937+21 , was discovered by Donald C. Backer , Shrinivas Kulkarni , Carl Heiles , Michael Davis, and Miller Goss.  This object spins 642 times per second and, until the discovery of PSR J1748-2446ad in 2005, was identified as the fastest-spinning pulsar.\\n\nIn 1980, Arecibo made the first radar observation of a comet when it successfully detected Comet Encke .  In August 1989, the observatory directly imaged an asteroid for the first time in history: 4769 Castalia .  The following year, Polish astronomer Aleksander Wolszczan made the discovery of pulsar PSR B1257+12 (Lich), which later led him to discover its three orbiting planets.  These were the first extrasolar planets discovered. In 1994, John Harmon used the Arecibo Radio Telescope to map the distribution of ice in the polar regions of Mercury .  \\n\nIn January 2008, detection of prebiotic molecules methanimine and hydrogen cyanide were reported from the observatory\\'s radio spectroscopy measurements of the distant starburst galaxy Arp 220 .  \\n\nFrom January 2010 to February 2011, astronomers Matthew Route and Aleksander Wolszczan detected bursts of radio emission from the T6.5 brown dwarf 2MASS J10475385+2124234. This was the first time that radio emission had been detected from a T dwarf, which has methane absorption lines in its atmosphere. It is also the coolest brown dwarf (at a temperature of ~900K) from which radio emission has been observed. The highly polarized and highly energetic radio bursts indicated that the object has a >1.7 kG -strength magnetic field and magnetic activity similar to both the planet Jupiter and the Sun .  \\n\nIn 1974, the Arecibo message , an attempt to communicate with potential extraterrestrial life , was transmitted from the radio telescope toward the globular cluster Messier 13 , about 25,000 light-years away.  The 1,679 bit pattern of 1s and 0s defined a 23 by 73 pixel bitmap image that included numbers, stick figures, chemical formulas and a crude image of the telescope.  \\n\nSearch for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)  is the search for extraterrestrial life or advanced technologies. SETI aims to answer the question \"Are we alone in the Universe?\" by scanning the skies for transmissions from intelligent civilizations elsewhere in our galaxy.\\n\nIn comparison, METI (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) refers to the active search by transmitting messages.\\n\nArecibo was the source of data for the SETI@home and Astropulse distributed computing projects put forward by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley , and was used for the SETI Institute \\'s Project Phoenix observations.  The Einstein@Home distributed computing project has found more than 20 pulsars in Arecibo data.  \\n\nTerrestrial aeronomy experiments at Arecibo included the Coqui 2 experiment, supported by NASA . The telescope also originally had military intelligence uses, including locating Soviet radar installations by detecting their signals bouncing off the Moon .  \\n\nLimited amateur radio operations were carried out, using moon bounce or Earth-Moon-Earth communication , in which radio signals aimed at the Moon are reflected back to Earth. The first of these operations was on June 13-14, 1964, using the call sign KP4BPZ. A dozen or so two-way contacts were made on 144 and 432 MHz. On July 3 and 24, 1965, KP4BPZ was again activated on 432 MHz, making approximately 30 contacts on 432 MHz during the limited time slots available. For these tests, a very wide-band instrumentation recorder captured a large segment of the receiving bandwidth, enabling later verification of other amateur station call signs. These were not two-way contacts. From April 16-18, 2010, the Arecibo Amateur Radio Club KP4AO again conducted moon-bounce activity using the antenna.  On November 10, 2013, the KP4AO Arecibo Amateur Radio Club conducted a Fifty-Year Commemoration Activation, lasting seven hours on 14.250 MHz SSB, without using the main dish antenna.  \\n\nCultural significance\nDue to its unique shape and concept, the telescope had been featured in many contemporary works. It serves as one of the central locations in The Sparrow , a science fiction novel written by Mary Doria Russell . It was used as a filming location in the films GoldenEye (1995), Species (1995), and Contact (1997) (based on Carl Sagan \\'s novel of the same name , which also featured the observatory), The Losers (2010),   and in The X-Files television episode \" Little Green Men \".  One map in the 2013 video game Battlefield 4 , while set in China, is based on the distinctive layout of the Arecibo Telescope.  In 2014, a video art installation piece titled The Great Silence by artists Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla in collaboration with science fiction writer Ted Chiang featured the radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory to represent the search for extraterrestrial life. The next year, Chiang published a novelette also called The Great Silence . The juxtaposed text was later published as a short story with the same title in a special issue of the art journal e-flux in 2015 and was included in the author\\'s short story collection Exhalation: Stories in 2019.  \\n\nThe asteroid 4337 Arecibo is named after the observatory by Steven J. Ostro , in recognition of the observatory\\'s contributions to the characterization of Solar System bodies.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

Also known as Puente Rio La Plata , it was the longest bridge constructed in Puerto Rico during the Spanish colonial period.  It crosses the Rio de la Plata , the longest river in Puerto Rico.  According to the U.S. National Park Service, \"[t]his is the most important metal bridge in Puerto Rico from the period.\"  The bridge is still standing.  \\n\nHistory\nThe bridge was built as \"part of the Carretera Central , the first highway across the central mountains of Puerto Rico.\"  The Carretera Central, a 134 kilometer highway between San Juan and the port of Ponce was largely completed by 1886, with temporary bridges in place at some crossings and 13 permanent bridges completed.  : E-7 The installation of the permanent Arenas Bridge in 1894 was near the completion of the Carretera in 1898.  : E-7 \\n\nBecause of scarcity of iron in Puerto Rico, there were no metal fabricators in the country.  Instead, bridges like this were fabricated overseas and shipped in parts to Puerto Rico.  A Spanish government agent in Paris secured international bids, largely from French and Belgian firms, for bridges to be built in the overseas colonies of Spain.  : E-10 The Arenas Bridge itself was fabricated by Nicaise et Delcuve , a Belgian firm, and was shipped on the steamship Teutonia to Puerto Rico for assembly.  \\n\nAn alternative to a truss bridge would have been a suspension bridge design, which was a well-developed technology for long spans before the Arenas Bridge was built.  However, there were no truly long spans in Puerto Rico that would have absolutely required a suspension bridge in colonial times, as there are no particularly wide rivers or canyons, and chief engineer Manuel Sanchez-Nunez assessed that suspension bridges were unsuited to the tropical climate, even removing, a few years later, one that had been constructed in Caguas in 1857.  : E-5 As a result, suspension bridge technology was not widely employed in Puerto Rico.  Even today it is believed that there are only a small number of suspension bridges in the commonwealth, one being a modern pedestrian bridge in Bayamon . [ citation needed ] Another one is located in Caguas .   and yet another one , a vehicular one, is on the Bayamon - Naranjito border.  \\n\nThe bridge was designed by Mariano Sichar.  A steel truss bridge, it weighed 23,623 pounds and was contracted to be built for 56,221 pesos.  Stone abutments to support the bridge were constructed under supervision of José Roque-Paniagua; engineer Julio Larrinaga oversaw assembly of the bridge.  \\n\nIt brings what is now Puerto Rico Highway 735 over Rio de la Plata between Barrio Monte Llano and Barrio Arenas.  It is between the municipalities of Cayey and Cidra .  \\n\nIn the Spanish-American War, American forces moved from south to north over the Carretara Central.  Another Carretera bridge was demolished by the Spanish to delay the American advance, but not Arenas Bridge.  : E-12 \\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

Founded on April 30, 1876,  it has been called Puerto Rico\\'s oldest cultural institution,  however, it is actually its third oldest overall and second culturally, after the Bar Association of Puerto Rico  and the Casino of Mayagüez.  \\n\nOne of its founders was the playwright, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera .  The Athenaeum was the first to give accolades and awards to artists and writers such as José Gautier Benítez , José de Diego , Manuel María Sama, Francisco Oller , Manuel Fernández Juncos , Lola Rodríguez de Tió and Luis Lloréns Torres .  \\n\nThe Athenaeum serves as a museum , school , library , and performance hall for the arts in Puerto Rico. It hosts a number of contests, conferences, and exhibits each year, presenting Puerto Rican art, literature, and music.   Since 1937 the use of the spaces of the Athenaeum has been limited to activities it sponsors.  Its headquarters are located in Puerta de Tierra , adjacent to Old San Juan , in a strip that also houses the \" Casa de España \", the Carnegie Library , the Capitol complex and the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee headquarters.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Atheaneaum was founded on Sunday, April 30, 1876 at San Juan City Hall .  One of its founders was the playwright, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera .

In 1976 the Athenaeum celebrated its centennial with Eladio Rodríguez Otero at the helm as president, who gave a speech in presence of the then governor Rafael Hernández Colón , Hiram Torres Rigual , in representation of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , and former governor Luis A. Ferré .  To commemorate the event, the Athenaeum also commissioned a medal to be awarded to those who represent \"the highest national values expressed through [Puerto Rican] culture .\" The Centennial Medal of the Puerto Rican Athenaeum was most recently awarded to the musical salsa group El Gran Combo .  \\n\nThe Athenaeum Building\nIn 1922 the Aguadillan architect, Francisco Roldán Arce was asked to draw up plans for the present building. The cornerstone was laid on 27 May 1923 in the presence of José Coll y Cuchi .  The architecture of the building, Spanish Morisco, was introduced to Puerto Rico by Pedro de Castro , who also built some of the structures that neighbor close by. De Castro\\'s tropical and mediterranean conscience objected to the architecture imported from the north, giving preference to the luminosity of the Caribbean, to the visual continuity of the spaces, to the galleries and balconies that served as a transition between interior and exterior spaces, shaped by the urban environment, the countryside or the inner courtyards.  \\n\nThe Athenaeum Art Gallery\nThe Athenaeum\\'s pride is its gallery of art, which consists of 459 artworks.  Among the artworks held at the Atheneum one of its most recognizable is Francisco Oller\\'s 1890 painting \" La Escuela del Maestro Rafael Cordero \".

Belaval founded the first professional theater groups in 1938. The Experimental Theatre of the Puerto Rican Antheneaum was founded in 1952 as the first incumbent company of the institution. As such, one of the greatest Puerto Rican playwrights of the twentieth century, René Marqués , commences a dissemination and creative project of drama that continues to this day, totaling over 500 productions and 26 Avant-Garde Theatre Festivals.  \\n\nMany participants of the Festivals are members of Puerto Rico\\'s thespian community. The Experimental Theatre Hall, which has capacity for 200, has been the premiere of many works that are now considered classical Puerto Rican drama. The most well-known of these is René Marqués\\' La Carreta , which premiered in 1953 under the patronage of the Athenaeum.

Originally known for its Bacardí brand of white rum , it now has a portfolio of more than 200 brands and labels.  Founded in Cuba in 1862 by Facundo Bacardí Massó , Bacardi Limited has been family-owned for seven generations, and employs more than 8,000 people with sales in approximately 170 countries. Bacardi Limited is the group of companies as a whole and includes Bacardi International Limited.  \\n\nBacardi Limited is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda , and has a board of directors led by the original founder\\'s great-great-grandson, Facundo L. Bacardí, the chairman of the board.  \\n\nHistory\nFacundo Bacardí Massó , a Spanish wine merchant , was born in Sitges , Catalonia, Spain , on October 16, 1814, and immigrated to Santiago , Cuba, in 1830. At the time, rum was cheaply made and not considered a refined drink, and rarely sold in upmarket taverns or purchased by the growing emerging middle class on the island.  Facundo began attempting to \"tame\" rum by isolating a proprietary strain of yeast harvested from local sugar cane still used in Bacardí production today. This yeast gives Bacardí rum its flavour profile. After experimenting with several techniques for close to ten years, Facundo pioneered charcoal rum filtration, which removed impurities from his rum. Facundo then created two separate distillates that he could blend together, balancing a variety of flavors: Aguardiente (a robust, flavorful distillate) and Redestillado (a refined, delicate distillate). Once Facundo achieved the perfect balance of flavors by marrying the two distillates together, he purposefully aged the rum in white oak barrels to develop subtle flavors and characteristics while mellowing out those that were unwanted. The final product was the first clear, light-bodied and mixable \"white\" rum in the world.  \\n\nMoving from the experimental stage to a more commercial endeavour as local sales began to grow, Facundo and his brother José purchased a Santiago de Cuba distillery on October 16, 1862, which housed a still made of copper and cast iron . In the rafters of this building lived fruit bats - the inspiration for the Bacardi bat logo.  It was the idea of Doña Amalia, Facundo\\'s wife, to adopt the bat to the rum bottle when she recognized its symbolism of family unity, good health, and good fortune to her husband\\'s homeland of Spain. This logo was pragmatic considering the high illiteracy rate in the 19th century, enabling customers to easily identify the product.  \\n\nThe 1880s and 1890s were turbulent times for Cuba and the company. Emilio Bacardí , Don Facundo\\'s eldest son, known for his forward thinking in both his professional and personal life and a passionate advocate for Cuban Independence was imprisoned twice for having fought in the rebel army against Spain in the Cuban War of Independence .  [ page needed ] \\n\nEmilio\\'s brothers, Facundo and José, and their brother-in-law Enrique \\'Henri\\' Schueg, remained in Cuba with the difficult task of sustaining the company during a period of war. With Don Facundo\\'s passing in 1886, Doña Amalia sought refuge by exile in Kingston, Jamaica . At the end of the Cuban War of Independence during the US occupation of Cuba, \"The Original Cuba Libre \" and the Daiquiri cocktails were both created, with the then Cuban based Bacardí rum.  In 1899, Emilio Bacardí became the first democratically elected mayor of Santiago, appointed US General Leonard Wood .\\n\nDuring his time in public office, Emilio established schools and hospitals, completed municipal projects such as the famous Padre Pico Street and the Bacardi Dam, financed the creation of parks, and decorated the city of Santiago with monuments and sculptures.  [ page needed ] In 1912, Emilio and his wife travelled to Egypt , where he purchased a mummy (still on display) for the future Emilio Bacardi Moreau Municipal Museum in Santiago de Cuba.  [ page needed ] In Santiago, his brother Facundo M. Bacardí continued to manage the company along with Schueg, who began the company\\'s international expansion by opening bottling plants in Barcelona (1910) and New York City (1916).  The New York plant was soon shut down due to Prohibition , yet during this time Cuba became a hotspot for US tourists, kicking off a period of rapid growth for the Bacardi company and the onset of cocktail culture in America.  \\n\nIn 1922 the family completed the expansion and renovation of the original distillery in Santiago, increasing the sites rum production capacity. In 1930 Schueg oversaw the construction and opening of Edificio Bacardí in Havana, regarded as one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America , as the third generation of the Bacardí family entered the business. In 1927, Bacardi ventured outside the realm of spirits for the first time, with the introduction of an authentic Cuban Malt beer: Hatuey beer .\\n\nBacardi\\'s success in transitioning into an international brand and company was due mostly to Schueg, who branded Cuba as \"The home of rum\", and Bacardí as \"The king of rums and the rum of Kings\". Expansion began overseas, first to Mexico in 1931 where it had architects Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe and Felix Candela design office buildings and a bottling plant in Mexico City during the 1950s. The building complex was added to the tentative list of UNESCO\\'s World Heritage Site list on 20 November 2001.  In 1936, Bacardi began producing rum on U.S. territory in Puerto Rico after Prohibition which enabled the company to sell rum tariff-free in the United States.  The company later expanded to the United States in 1944 with the opening of Bacardi Imports, Inc. in Manhattan , New York City .  \\n\nDuring World War II , the company was led by Schueg\\'s son-in-law, José \"Pepin\" Bosch. Pepin founded Bacardi Imports in New York City, and became Cuba\\'s Minister of the Treasury in 1949.\\n\nDuring the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the Bacardí family (and hence the company) supported and aided the rebels.  However, after the triumph of the revolutionaries, and turn to communism, the family maintained a fierce opposition to Fidel Castro\\'s policies in Cuba in the 1960s. In his book, Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba , Tom Gjelten describes how the Bacardí family and the company left Cuba in exile after the Cuban government confiscated the company\\'s Cuban assets without compensation on 14 October 1960, particularly nationalizing and banning all private property on the island as well as all bank accounts.  However, due to concerns over the previous Cuban leader, Fulgencio Batista , the company had started foreign branches a few years before the revolution; the company moved the ownership of its trademarks, assets and proprietary formulas out of the country to the Bahamas prior to the revolution and already produced Bacardí rum at other distillery sites in Puerto Rico and Mexico . This helped the company survive after the Cuban government confiscated all Bacardí assets in the country without any compensation.  \\n\nIn 1965, over 100 years after the company was established in Cuba, Bacardi established new roots and found a new home with global headquarters in Hamilton, Bermuda. In February 2019, Bacardi\\'s CEO, Mahesh Madhavan, stated that Bacardí\\'s global headquarters would remain in Bermuda for the next \"500 years\" and that \"Bermuda is our home now.\"  \\n\nIn 1999, Otto Reich , a lobbyist in Washington on behalf of Bacardí, drafted section 211 of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, FY1999 , a bill that became known as the Bacardi Act. Section 211 denied trademark protection to products of Cuban businesses expropriated after the Cuban revolution, a provision sought by Bacardí. The act was aimed primarily at the Havana Club brand in the United States. The brand was created by the José Arechabala S.A. and nationalised without compensation in the Cuban revolution, the Arechabala family left Cuba and stopped producing rum. They therefore allowed the US trademark registration for \"Havana Club\" to lapse in 1973. Taking advantage of the lapse, the Cuban government registered the mark in the United States in 1976.   This new law was drafted to invalidate the trademark registration. Section 211 has been challenged unsuccessfully by the Cuban government and the European Union in US courts. It was ruled illegal by the WTO in 2001 and 2002.  The US Congress has yet to re-examine the matter. The brand was assigned by the Cuban government to Pernod Ricard in 1993.\\n\nBacardi rekindled the story of the Arechabala family and Havana Club in the United States when it launched the AMPARO Experience in 2018, an immersive play experience based in Miami, the city with the highest population of Cuban exiles. AMPARO \"is the story of the family's entire history being erased and their heritage \\xe2\\x80\\x98stolen'\" according to playwright Vanessa Garcia.  \\n\nIn 1964, Bacardi opened new US offices in Miami , Florida . Exiled Cuban architect Enrique Gutierrez created a building that was hurricane-proof, using a system of steel cables and pulleys which allow the building to move slightly in the event of a strong shock. The steel cables are anchored into the bedrock and extend through marble-covered shafts up to the top floor, where they are led over large pulleys. Outside, on both sides of the eight-story building, more than 28,000 tiles painted and fired by Brazilian artist Francisco Brennand , depicting abstract blue flowers, were placed on the walls according to the artist\\'s exact specifications.\\n\nIn 1973, the company commissioned the square building in the plaza. Architect Ignacio Carrera-Justiz used cantilevered construction, a style invented by Frank Lloyd Wright . Wright observed how well trees with taproots withstood hurricane-force winds. The building, raised 47 feet (14 m) off the ground around a central core, features four massive walls, made of sections of inch-thick hammered glass mural tapestries, designed and manufactured in France. The striking design of the annex, affectionately known as the \\'Jewel Box\\' building,  came from a painting by German artist Johannes M. Dietz.\\n\nIn 2006, Bacardi USA leased a 15-story headquarters complex in Coral Gables, Florida . Bacardi had employees in seven buildings across Miami-Dade County at the time.  \\n\nBacardi vacated its former headquarters buildings on Biscayne Boulevard in Midtown Miami . The building currently serves as the headquarters of the National YoungArts Foundation . Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as \"historic\". The Bacardi Buildings Complex has been a locally protected historic resource since Oct. 6, 2009, when it was designated by unanimous decision by the Historic and Environmental Preservation Board.  \\n\nIn 2007 Chad Oppenheim, the head of Oppenheim Architecture + Design, described the Bacardi buildings as \"elegant, with a Modernist [look combined with] a local flavour\".  In April 2009, University of Miami professor of architecture Allan Schulman said \"Miami\\'s brand is its identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about.\"  \\n\nThe American headquarters is in Coral Gables, Florida .  \\n\nBacardi drinks are not easily found in Cuba today. The main brand of rum in Cuba is Havana Club , produced by a company that was confiscated and nationalized by the government following the revolution. Bacardi later bought the brand from the original owners, the Arechabala family. The Cuban government, in partnership with the French company Pernod Ricard , sells its Havana Club products internationally, except in the United States and its territories. Bacardi created the Real Havana Club rum based on the original recipe from the Arechabala family, manufactures it in Puerto Rico, and sells it in the United States. Bacardi continues to fight in the courts, attempting to legalize their own Havana Club trademark outside the United States.  \\n\nBacardi Limited has made numerous acquisitions to diversify away from the eponymous Bacardí rum brand.\\n\nIn 1993, Bacardi merged with Martini & Rossi , the Italian producer of Martini vermouth and sparkling wines, creating the Bacardi-Martini group. Other associated brands include the Real Havana Club , Drambuie Scotch whisky liqueur, DiSaronno Amaretto , Eristoff vodka, Cazadores Tequila , B&B and Bénédictine liqueurs.\\n\nIn 1998, Bacardi company acquired John Dewar & Sons, Ltd and Bombay Sapphire from Diageo for $2 billion.  \\n\nIn 2004, Bacardi purchased Grey Goose , a French-made vodka, from Sidney Frank for $2 billion.  \\n\nIn 2006 Bacardi purchased New Zealand vodka brand 42 Below.  \\n\nIn 2018, Bacardi  purchased tequila manufacturer Patrón Spirits Company for $5.1 billion.  \\n\nIn 2023, Bacardi acquired the renowned super-premium mezcal brand, Ilegal Mezcal .  \\n\nIn December 2023, Bacardi took majority control of Irish whiskey producer Teeling .  \\n\nBrands\nBacardi beverage brands include:  \\n\nBeer : Hatuey \\n\nCacha\\xc3 7a : Leblon \\n\nCognac : Baron Otard , D\\'ussé \\n\nGin : Bombay Sapphire , Bosford Rose, Oxley\\n\nLiqueur : Bénédictine , Cedlila, Get , Martini Spirito , Patrón Citrónge , St-Germain \\n\nMezcal: Ilegal \\n\nRum : Bacardí, Banks, Castillo, Facundo, Havana Club (USA only) , Pyrat, Santa Teresa , Single Cane Estate\\n\nSparkling wine : Martini Alta Langa , Martini Asti , Martini Grandi Augur , Martini Magici Istanti , Martini Prosecco , Martini Riserva di Montellera .

Several Bacardí spirits have performed notably well.     In 2020, Bacardí Superior , Bacardí Gold, Bacardí Black, Bacardí Añejo Cuatro were each awarded a gold medal by the International Quality Institute Monde Selection. In addition, both Bacardí Reserva Ocho and Bacardí Gran Reserva Diez were awarded the top honor of Grand Gold quality award.  \\n\nHemingway connection\nErnest Hemingway lived in Cuba from 1939 until shortly after the Cuban Revolution . He lived at Finca Vigía , in the small town of San Francisco de Paula, located very close to Bacardi\\'s Modelo Brewery for Hatuey Beer in Cotorro, Havana .\\n\nIn 1954, Compañía Ron Bacardi S.A. threw Hemingway a party when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature - soon after the publication of his novel The Old Man and the Sea (1952) - in which he honored the company by mentioning its Hatuey beer. Hemingway also mentioned Bacardí and Hatuey in his novels To Have and Have Not (1937) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Guillermo Cabrera Infante wrote an account of the festivities for the periodical Ciclón , titled \"El Viejo y la Marca\" (\"The Old Man and the Brand\", a play on \"El Viejo y el Mar\", the book\\'s Spanish title). In his account he described how \"on one side there was a wooden stage with two streamers - Hatuey beer and Bacardi rum - on each end and a Cuban flag in the middle. Next to the stage was a bar, at which people crowded, ordering daiquiris and beer, all free.\"  A sign at the event read \"Bacardi rum welcomes the author of The Old Man and the Sea \".\\n\nIn his article \"The Old Man and the Daiquiri\", Wayne Curtis writes about how Hemingway\\'s \"home bar also held a bottle of Bacardí rum\". Hemingway wrote in Islands in the Stream , \"...this frozen daiquirí, so well beaten as it is, looks like the sea where the wave falls away from the bow of a ship when she is doing thirty knots.\"  \\n\nMishaps\nOn August 16, 2012 temporary worker Lawrence Daquan \"Day\" Davis was crushed to death when a faulty palletizer he was cleaning, was activated due to non-existent lockout/tagout procedures.  An OSHA investigation found 12 safety violations and Bacardi was fined $192,000,  but reached an agreement where it paid $110,000.  \\n\nIn March 2022, after Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine , Bacardi announced that it would halt all exports to Russia and freeze investment and advertising programs.   From June 2022 through June 2023, the company imported $169 million worth of products  and tripled its profits.   , and through the summer of 2023 it increased its business in Russia and sought new employees for its Russian branch.  When this gained international media attention, the pledge disappeared from their company website.   On August 10, 2023, Ukrainian authorities added Bacardi to their list of International Sponsors of War .   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The bay is an intertidal tropical ecosystem dominated by seagrass beds , coral reefs , and mangroves .  In an area of 1,140 hectares (2,800 acres), the reserve contains five distinct habitat types and provides sanctuary to several endangered species.  Bahía de Jobos is one of 28 reserves that comprise the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Estuarine Research Reserve System .  The reserve is operated in conjunction with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA).\\n\nHistory\nJobos Bay is located on the south coast of Puerto Rico in Aguirre barrio, between Salinas and Guayama .  Most of the land in the reserve is owned by a private company which leased the land to the Aguirre Corporation, which operated an extensive sugarcane farm and sugar mill in the region.  After the burst of the sugar industry, Aguirre closed in 1980 and the land remains owned by the private corporation. The land has been offered to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico but because of financial troubles the purchase never concluded.  The land remains under private ownership but part of the Bay is Federal Land.  Bahía de Jobos was established as a National Estuarine Sanctuary in 1981. Jobos Bay private lands remains the only undeveloped bay lands in the entire island, consisting of close to 160 hectares (400 acres) and more than 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) of frontage to the bay.  In fact, The Jobos Bay property controls most of the northern section of the Bay.  It runs close to Aguirre Sugar Mill and all the way to the Eastern edge of Jobos Bay.  This property can be developed for commercial and private use.  A new corporation was established in 2017 Jobos Bay Properties, Inc. to administer the sale of the land in private hands.  \\n\nSince the 1980s, land-use in the areas surrounding Bahía de Jobos has continued to change.  The Corporacion Amoros private reserve borders the Aguirre State Forest on the East, a fisherman village (Las Mareas) on the West, and agricultural and residential land on the north.  Due to urbanization in the region and shifting irrigation regimes, watershed dynamics have changed significantly. [ citation needed ] \\n\nAbout 30 families who have squatted on the land were facing eviction in 2022.  \\n\nEcology\nJobos Bay is a tropical estuary with five distinct habitat types grading roughly from the ocean landward: coral reefs , seagrass beds , mangrove forests , mudflats , and evergreen littoral forests .  Jobos is the second largest estuary in Puerto Rico by total area and the largest (by a factor of three) by total coastline.  The Jobos mangroves are estimated to comprise 42.6% of that habitat type on the south coast of Puerto Rico.\\n\nAt least seven endangered species can be found at Bahía de Jobos.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n17°57\\xe2\\x80\\xb227.26\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°13\\xe2\\x80\\xb220.13\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 17.9575722°N 66.2222583°W ﻿ / 17.9575722; -66.2222583 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBallajá Barracks\nThe Ballajá Barracks ( Cuartel de Ballajá in Spanish ) is a historic building and former military barracks located in the Ballajá section of Old San Juan , in the city of San Juan , Puerto Rico . It is located close to El Morro and its esplanade, between the Morovis, Beneficiencia and Norzagaray streets. It was built from 1854 to 1864 to house Spanish and Puerto Rican regiments. The Ballajá Barracks were the last large-scale construction project made by the Spanish Crown in the Americas.  \\n\nThe building has been owned by the government of Puerto Rico since 1976 and today it houses the Museum of the Americas and the Puerto Rican Academy of the Spanish Language , in addition to several businesses and institutions such as a dance school, exhibition spaces, restaurants and the State Office of Historic Conservation.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Ballajá Barracks were built by the Spanish militia from 1854 to 1864. To build it, six blocks from the Ballajá subbarrio (in Old San Juan) were expropriated from the Dominican Order and demolished in 1853. The three-story structure was completed in 1864, occupying an area of 7,700 square meters (83,000 sq ft). It could accommodate over 1,000 citizens, originally Spanish soldiers and their families. Its vast interior patio is one of the best examples of 19th-century Spanish architecture in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nOther than the housing facilities, the barracks had storage rooms, kitchens, mess halls , dungeons , and horse stables .\\n\nThe barracks were heavily used during the Spanish-American War near the end of the 19th century. On May 12, 1898, during the American bombing of San Juan , the fleet led by Admiral William T. Sampson damaged the northeast side of the barracks.  \\n\nAfter the war ended, and with the change of sovereignty, the barracks became the quarters for the United States Army until 1939.   \\n\nDuring the Second World War, the barracks were used as a military hospital , under the name of Army General Hospital of Fort Brooke . On August 31, 1944, the United States Department of War issued General Order No. 71 which renamed the hospital to Rodriguez (161st) General Hospital , in honor of Major Fernando E. Rodríguez Vargas . \\n\nAfter the end of the war, the building was abandoned and it rapidly decayed. Although it was in disrepair, the building was included in the first heritage list of historic structures and monuments prepared by academic architect Mario J. Buschiazzo for the Puerto Rico Planning Board in 1955.  Scholar and archaeologist Ricardo Alegría proposed revitalization of the building for it to be used as an academic or educational institution.  \\n\nThe Ballajá Barracks today house several educational and cultural organizations, namely the Museo de las Américas on the second floor of the building since 1992. This museum is dedicated to the history, culture and heritage of the American continent. The Museo de Las Américas has three permanent collections: African Heritage, the Indian in America, and Popular Arts in America. In addition to the museum on the second floor, the first floor houses a dance school specializing in tablao flamenco , a bar, a movie theater, a coffee exhibition and café, and a Spanish restaurant called Rincón Ibérico, while the second-floor hosts offices and academic institutions such as the Puerto Rican Academy of the Spanish Language and the State Office of Historic Conservation.  \\n\nThe building sustained damages after Hurricane Maria but restoration was successful with help of more than $17.5 million in FEMA grants.  After careful structural analysis and studies from the State Historic Preservation Office, a sedum green roof (or living roof) was installed in the barracks rooftop. This area is open to visitors, and it consists of observation and sitting areas, walkways and solar panels.  \\n\nOwnership\nInitially, when Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain to the United States, the federal government paid the Catholic Church for this property, among others in the area.  Ownership of the property, claimed by the Catholic Church, was not a straightforward matter and had to be resolved by the Supreme Court .    \\n\nThe Government of Puerto Rico acquired the building in 1976 through a transfer from the Government of the United States with the commitment of restoring it and using it for cultural, educative, and touristic purposes. In 1986, a reform plan for the San Juan Historic Zone was sketched and the building was restored from 1990 to 1993.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBanco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño (building)\n\\n\nThe Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño building (or Banco Crédito , for short), a historic building in Ponce, Puerto Rico , was the first and main office of the historic Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño (English: Ponce Credit and Savings Bank ), and represents one of the last examples of the once popular turn-of-the-century eclectic architecture.  The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 25, 1987. It was built in 1924.  The building was owned by Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño which was one of the largest banking companies in the country of Puerto Rico during most of the twentieth century.\\n\nLocation\nThe building is located on Calle Marina (Marina Street) and Calle Amor (Amor Street, now \"Paseo Arias\" (Arias Promenade ),  facing west across Plaza Degetau . It is bounded on the east by Calle Mayor (Mayor Street). Amor Street was also called Callejon Amor (Amor Alley), literally, Love Alley . In 1991, Amor Street was converted into a promenade and renamed Paseo Antonio S. Arias Ventura, after the long-time employee of Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño who started as a custodian and rose to become the bank\\'s general manager.  \\n\nHistory and Significance\nBuilt in 1924 as the main office for the expanding Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño bank this building represents one of the last examples of the once popular turn-of-the-century eclectic architecture so common in Ponce after the 1918 earthquake .  Banco Crédito was designed and built by Francisco Porrata-Doria , who at the time had recently returned to Puerto Rico after studying engineering at Cornell University and architectural courses at Columbia University .  Porrata Doria was one of the island\\'s finest architects, a pioneer in the development of a local modern architecture, and one of the architects responsible for what can be called \"Ponce Monumental Architecture\", of which Banco Crédito is a good example.  Among the directors and officers of this prominent bank were some of the most recognized names in the city of Ponce and Puerto Rico at large, including former Ponce mayor, Ulpiano Colóm .\\n\nThis building together with the one next door it, Banco de Ponce , exemplify the effort of local financial institutions to compete with US-based banks for the wealth of Puerto Rico\\'s booming sugar economy.  \\n\nBanco Crédito\\'s monumental exuberance expresses the pride of the institution, its solidity, and its capacity to hold its own against far more wealthy Stateside institutions competing for the dollars of the local moneyed classes.  \\n\nThe Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño s setting on the city\\'s main square contributes to the elegance of this part of the city. Several adjacent structures are already listed in the National Register, including the old Firehouse (1883) the City Hall (1845) and the Cathedral (1841). The latter\\'s facade is a 1932 Porrata-Doria design.  \\n\nArchitecture\nThe building\\'s architect was Francisco Porrata-Doria .  It is a two-story masonry and concrete building located near the southeastern end of Ponce\\'s main square. It sits on a corner lot, looking southwestward towards the main street, Plaza Degetau (Calle Atocha).  \\n\nIt is a single, compact volume which wraps itself around the corner in a dramatic curve that corresponds to the chamfered corner required since the late 19th century by city ordinances. The main two levels have nearly twenty-feet-high ceilings, thus giving the structure sufficient bulk so as to stand out within its context. Verticality is accented by the use of colossal Corinthian pilasters , square and paired at the facades to each street and round and single at the corner.  \\n\nThe exterior is compositionally organized in three levels: the bottom one is a base executed in the pink limestone common to this area; the central and main body is defined by the aforementioned colossal pilasters, which articulate the openings of the two main floors in three-bay modules with additional one-bay modules flanking the longer, Amor Street facade.  \\n\nThe upper body is an elaborate entablature with garlands , dentils, and a projecting, bracketed upper cornice. On top there is a balustered railing filling the space between three broken pediments, the one on the corner curved, with medallions on their centers.

Though its headquarters had moved to a presumptuous building in Hato Rey \\'s Milla de Oro by then, Banco de Ponce continued to consider this building its main office, until the company merged with Banco Popular in 1990.  The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 25, 1987. It was built in 1924.  \\n\nLocation\nThe building is located facing Plaza Degetau .  The large structure occupies a small city block .  It is bounded by Mayor, Francisco Parra Duperon (also known as Comercio ), Marina, and Amor streets. Amor street was also called Callejon Amor , or Amor Alley; literally, Love Alley . In 1991, Amor street was converted into a promenade and renamed Paseo Antonio Arias Ventura, after the long-time employee of the bank who started as a custodian and rose to become the bank\\'s general manager.\\n\nArchitecture\nThe building\\'s architect was Francisco Porrata Doria .  \\n\nThe Banco de Ponce building is a four-story brick and concrete structure. As it is set in a very narrow triangular lot defined by near-parallel Amor and Comercio Streets, the architect\\'s solution to the lot\\'s footprint geometry was the development of a continuous facade enveloping these two streets and the narrow front to Plaza Las Delicias .  \\n\nThe predominant style is related to the Beaux art neoclassical , with three\\nhorizontal bands defining this wraparound facade. The base is made of a pinkish stone\\nextracted from a quarry close to the city. This stone has been commonly used in other\\nPonce buildings.  \\n\nThe second and third floors house bank office. \"These are rendered in elaborate plasterwork with square Corinthian columns, brackets, medallions and panels between the structural beams ornamented with paterae. Naturalistic motifs are ubiquitous.\"  For a while, the building\\'s third floor was used as a ballroom for Ponce\\'s old casino .  \\n\nContemporary use\nIn 1990, at the time of the merger between Banco de Ponce and Banco Popular, Banco de Ponce continued to operate at this building as Banco de Ponce, but eventually the BanPonce Corporation branded all of its branches with the Banco Popular name. Subsequently, the building was sold to Scotiabank , the Canadian concern, but later Banco Popular switched with Scotiabank the Banco de Ponce building, and Banco Popular has been using it since as its downtown Ponce branch.  Today, the first floor of the building houses a branch of Banco Popular. The fourth floor houses Banco Popular\\'s regional offices and the Commercial Banking Center.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The Archbishop of San Juan , Cardinal Luis Aponte Martínez , executed the rite of coronation on 12 February 1995.  The same Pontiff issued a decree titled Celeberrimum in Civitate that raised the sanctuary to the status of a minor basilica on 19 May 1998.  \\n\nHistory\nThe foundation of the basilica is on the site of a rural chapel built by the Catalan estate owner Don Gerardo González , who was the owner of the valleys of the region.  Although the specific date when the original chapel was constructed is not known, some records date it as far as 1590. Also, radiocarbon dating tests done to pieces of wood from a coffin found in the basilica point to the existence of the chapel as far back as 1570.\\n\nThe structure combines romantic elements and styles in its architecture, including a bell tower with Mozarabic elements.\\n\nIn 1696, the chapel acquired a guest house called Casa de Peligrinos (Pilgrims House). In 1814, Juan Alejo de Arizmendi , the first native Puerto Rican bishop, fell ill in this house after traveling around the island in his second pastoral visit.  He desired to be buried in his beloved chapel. He died in Arecibo the following October 12, but his wishes were not followed, burial instead taking place in his cathedral . The house is now the rectory of the basilica.\\n\nThe basilica and its rectory were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as the Santuario de la Monserate de Hormigueros and Casa de Peregrinos .   It was also added to the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.  \\n\nOn 19 May 1998, Pope John Paul II issued a pontifical decree that raised the status of the structure to a minor basilica , a distinction held previously on the island only by the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista in the capital.\\n\nOn 24 October 1999, the Archbishop of San Juan , Roberto González Nieves , Roberto González Nieves read the papal decree before the public in commemoration of the shrines 400th centennial anniversary.  \\n\nFolklore\nThere is folklore about the town\\'s founder, an explanation of why the church in the town, Basílica Menor de la Virgen de Monserrate, became so important. The legend has to do with the townspeople aiding Geraldo in finding his eight-year-old daughter, \"with eyes as blue as the turquoise skies\", when she disappeared. When his daughter was found 15 days later she was unharmed, not hungry, and unafraid and happily explained that a beautiful, black woman had helped her, caressed her face and given her fruit. Geraldo reported it was the Virgin of Montserrat and Geraldo said that for having helped his daughter she would be venerated for all ages. Many people heard of the tale but it had not been the first tale from Geraldo.  The first and more popular tale from Geraldo had been that a savage bull was going to attack him and when he prayed, the bull bent its knees, bowed its head to the ground, and didn\\'t attack.  Some versions of the story state the bull\\'s legs actually broke rendering the bull immobile and unable to charge at him.  Since then, many Catholics perform penitence by walking the steps to the church on their knees.  Many pilgrimages have been made to the church, even as early as in the 17th century.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBaños de Coamo\nThe Baños de Coamo , located in the municipality of Coamo , are one of Puerto Rico \\'s thermal springs.  \\n\nUsed by the Tainos in the pre-Columbian era, the Baños were believed by many to have healing powers. The Baños became a popular tourist attraction among the early Spanish settlers which prompted the construction of a resort by local entrepreneurs. Coamo was the site of an important battle during the Puerto Rico Campaign of the Spanish-American War and were subject to artillery bombardments which damaged the resort. The historic Baños and resort were restored during the 20th century by the Government of Puerto Rico, becoming once more a popular tourist attraction.\\n\nHistory of the \"Baños\"\nThe Taino \\'s who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus and the Spanish conquistadors were the first Europeans to discover the hot spring waters of Coamo.  According to local legend, the first governor of Puerto Rico Juan Ponce de León , heard about the healing powers of the Baños from the Tainos. Believing that the baths were the Fountain of Youth which he was seeking, Ponce de Leon asked where they were located, however he misunderstood the instructions given to him and instead headed by sea towards a new land which resulted in the discovery of Florida and his death.   During the mid-16th century the word spread among the Spanish settlers of the healing powers of the six sulfur-rich spring waters and as a consequence, many of the settlers began to make the regular journeys from San Juan to the mountainous region to enjoy what they believed were the benefits of said waters.  \\n\nIn 1847, Andrés G. Luhring, an entrepreneur from Ponce , built the first structures in \"Los Baños\". He built a guest house (hostel) made of wood in front of the baths to house the frequent visitors. He later had the main guest house built of stone and wood. Luhring had barriers placed around the baths which provided the visitors with privacy while bathing. Luhring lacked the necessary capital to continue operations and sold his interest in the same to a native Coameño, José Usera Soriano who in 1857 built an elegant 20-room hotel out of brick, rubble masonry and wood.  \\n\nWhen the United States invaded Puerto Rico as a result of the Spanish-American War , the town of Coamo was involved in what is known as the Battle of Coamo during the Puerto Rico Campaign . Lieutenant Colonel Rafael Martinez-Illesas of the Spanish Army with 248 Spanish and Puerto Rican troops under his command held the Baños de Coamo. General James H. Wilson ordered the 3rd and 4th Regular Pennsylvania Artillery to provide artillery support for the frontal assault on the Baños, while Troop C covered the right side against flanking. The troops under Lt. Col. Martínez had already traveled eastward towards the town of Aibonito and only a handful of soldiers remained behind to delay the American advance. Troop C galloped at top speed north from the Baños de Coamo, after finding the resort abandoned by the Spanish. The damages caused by the artillery bombardment during the war are still visible today.  \\n\nIn 1879, Braulio Dueño Colon , a Puerto Rican musician and composer, composed the music for the Zarzuela (a Spanish lyric-dramatic genre that alternates between spoken and sung scenes, the latter incorporating operatic and popular song, as well as dance) \"Los Baños de Coamo\" which was originally written by Genaro de Arazamendi.  \\n\nBy the end 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, the springs gained international recognition. The resort that operated between 1847 and 1958 and which still had the hotel built by Usera Soriano in 1857, welcomed many notable visitors including Franklin D. Roosevelt , Frank Lloyd Wright , Alexander Graham Bell , and Thomas Edison .   The Baños de Coamo resort closed its doors in 1959 and was in ruins and abandonment for many years.  \\n\nIn contemporary times, the springs continue to be marketed as a great place to visit.  \\n\nThe Parador Program of Puerto Rico\nIn 1970 the Government of Puerto Rico established \"El Programa de Paradores de Puerto Rico\" (The Parador Program of Puerto Rico) under the jurisdiction of \"La Compañía de Turismo de Puerto Rico\" (The Puerto Rico Tourism Company). The Baños de Coamo were included in the program and modern structures were built. The new concept was officially inaugurated in 1978. What remains of the original 1857 hotel is the restaurant and some walls, among which there is a central wall structure which has been preserved and incorporated into a fountain courtyard on the grounds, adding to the historic ambiance of the modern Parador.  \\n\nThe Parador at the hot springs, is called \"El Parador Baños de Coamo\". The 48-room Parador, unlike a hotel, is small and cozy and has a swimming pool which has an access area to the hot springs. There is a pool which is supplied with the hot spring water with underground piping. There are multiple levels of baths, The top level is the hottest, this spills into a larger bath below which is cooler and then finally into a large pool which is coolest, but still warm. The pools are drained regularly for sanitation and cleaning.  According to a study by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), daily discharge rates of the spring are between 32,000 and 83,000 gallons and the average water temperature is 43 degrees Celsius.  \\n\nIn 1995, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company sold both the Parador and an adjacent 24-acre (97,000 m 2 ) property, however in December 2001, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico handed down a decision nullifying the sale and returned the Parador\\'s ownership to the Tourism Co. Hector Torres Zayas, owner of the adjacent Coamo Springs Golf & Tennis Club, proposed to incorporated the Parador into his Coamo Springs resort hotel & spa project with an investment of $3 million in improvements to the Parador, which would include the restoration of its 48 rooms, the building of another 30 rooms, and the improvement of the recreational facilities. Even though Torres Zayas\\' Coamo Springs project was endorsed by the USGS, Coamo Mayor Juan Carlos Garcia, the Puerto Rico Tourism Co., the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Co., the Economic Development Bank, and the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, the deal did not go through and the Parador was instead sold to Antonio Umpierre, its current owner.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBiblical Magi\nIn Christianity , the Biblical Magi [ a ] , also known as the Three Wise Men , Three Kings , and Three Magi , [ b ] are distinguished foreigners who visit Jesus after his birth, bearing gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh in homage to him.  They are commemorated on the feast day of Epiphany \\xe2\\x80\\x94sometimes called \"Three Kings Day\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94and commonly appear in the nativity celebrations of Christmas . \\n\nThe Magi appear solely in the Gospel of Matthew , which states that they came \"from the east\" to worship the \"one who has been born king of the Jews\".  Their names, origins, appearances, and exact number are unmentioned and derive from the inferences or traditions of later Christians.  In Western Christianity , they are usually assumed to have been three in number, corresponding with each gift;  in Eastern Christianity , especially the Syriac churches , they often number twelve.  Likewise, the Magi\\'s social status is never stated: Although some biblical translations describe them as astrologers , they were increasingly identified as kings by at least the third century,  which conformed with Christian interpretations of Old Testament prophecies that the messiah would be worshipped by kings.   \\n\nThe mystery of the Magi\\'s identities and background, combined with their theological significance, has made them prominent figures in the Christian tradition ; they are venerated as saints or even martyrs in many Christian communities, and are the subject of numerous artworks, legends, and customs. Both secular and Christian observers have noted that the Magi popularly serve as a means of expressing various ideas, symbols, and themes.    Most scholars regard the Magi as legendary rather than historical figures.  \\n\nBiblical account\nTraditional nativity scenes depict three \"wise men\" visiting the infant Jesus on the night of his birth, in a manger accompanied by the shepherds and angels, but this should be understood as an artistic convention allowing the two separate scenes of the Adoration of the Shepherds on the birth night and the later Adoration of the Magi to be combined for convenience.  The single biblical account in Matthew 2 simply presents an event at an unspecified point after Christ\\'s birth in which an unnumbered party of unnamed \"wise men\" ( \\xce\\xbc\\xce c\\xce\\xb3\\xce\\xbf\\xce\\xb9 , mágoi ) visits him in a house ( \\xce\\xbf\\xe1\\xbc\\xb0\\xce\\xba\\xce f\\xce\\xb1\\xce\\xbd , oikian ), not a stable.  The New Revised Standard Version of Matthew 2:1 - 12 describes the visit of the Magi in this manner:\\n\nIn the time of King Herod , after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea , wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, \"Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.\"  When King Herod heard this, he was frightened and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, \"In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet: \\'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel. \\' \" Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, \"Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.\" When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another path.\nThe text specifies no interval between the birth and the visit, and artistic depictions and the closeness of the traditional dates of December 25 and January 6 encourage the popular assumption that the visit took place the same winter as the birth, but later traditions varied, with the visit taken as occurring up to two winters later. This maximum interval explained Herod\\'s command at Matthew 2:16 - 18 that the Massacre of the Innocents included boys up to two years old. Some more recent commentators, not tied to the traditional feast days, suggest a variety of intervals.  \\n\nThe wise men are mentioned twice shortly thereafter in verse 16 , in reference to their avoidance of Herod after seeing Jesus, and what Herod had learned from their earlier meeting. The star which they followed has traditionally become known as the Star of Bethlehem .   \\n\nDescription\nThe Magi are popularly referred to as wise men and kings . The word magi is the plural of Latin magus , borrowed from Greek \\xce\\xbc\\xce c\\xce\\xb3\\xce\\xbf\\xcf\\x82 ( magos ),  as used in the original Greek text of the Gospel of Matthew (in the plural: \\xce\\xbc\\xce c\\xce\\xb3\\xce\\xbf\\xce\\xb9 , magoi ). The Greek magos itself is derived from Old Persian magu\\xc5\\x9d, which in turn originated from the Avestan mag\\xc3 2un\\xc3\\xb4 , referring to the Iranian priestly caste of Zoroastrianism .   Within this tradition, priests paid particular attention to the stars and gained an international reputation for astrology ,  which was at that time highly regarded as a science.  Their religious practices and astrological abilities caused derivatives of the term Magi to be applied to the occult in general and led to the English term magic .\\n\nThe King James Version translates \"magi\" as wise men ; the same translation is applied to the wise men led by Daniel of earlier Hebrew Scriptures ( Daniel 2:48 ). The same word is given as sorcerer and sorcery when describing \" Elymas the sorcerer\" in Acts 13:6-11 , and Simon Magus , considered a heretic by the early Church, in Acts 8:9-13 . Several translations refer to the men outright as astrologers at Matthew Chapter 2 , including New English Bible (1961); Phillips New Testament in Modern English (J.B.Phillips, 1972); Twentieth Century New Testament (1904 revised edition); Amplified Bible (1958, New Testament); An American Translation (1935, Goodspeed); and The Living Bible (K. Taylor, 1962, New Testament).\\n\nAlthough the Magi are commonly referred to as \"kings\", there is nothing in the Gospel of Matthew that implies they were rulers of any kind. The identification of the Magi as kings is linked to Old Testament prophecies that describe the Messiah being worshipped by kings in Isaiah 60:3 , Psalm 68:29 , and Psalm 72:10 , which reads, \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations serve him.\"    Early readers reinterpreted Matthew in light of these prophecies and elevated the Magi to kings, which became widely accepted by at least 500 A.D.  Later Christian interpretation stressed the adoration of the Magi and shepherds as the first recognition by humans of Christ as the Redeemer. However, the Protestant reformer John Calvin was vehemently opposed to referring to the Magi as kings, writing: \"But the most ridiculous contrivance of the Papists on this subject is, that those men were kings... Beyond all doubt, they have been stupefied by a righteous judgment of God, that all might laugh at [their] gross ignorance.\"   \\n\nIdentities and background\nThe names and origins of the Magi are never given in scripture, but have been provided by various traditions and legends.  \\n\nAmong Western Christians , the earliest and most common names are:\\n\nThese names first appear in an eighth century religious chronicle, Excerpta Latina Barbari , which is a Latin translation of a lost Greek manuscript probably composed in Alexandria roughly two centuries earlier.  Another eighth century text, Collectanea et Flores , which was likewise a Latin translation from an original Greek account, continues the tradition of three kings and their names and gives additional details.   \\n\nOne candidate for the origin of the name Caspar appears in the apocryphal Acts of Thomas , which gives the account of Thomas the Apostle \\'s visit to the Indo-Parthian King Gondophares I (21- c. 47 AD), also known as Gudapharasa, from which \"Caspar\" might derive as corruption of \"Gaspar\".  Gondophares had declared independence from the Arsacids and ruled a kingdom spanning present-day Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. According to historian Ernst Herzfeld, his name is perpetuated in the name of the Afghan city Kandahar , which he is said to have founded under the name Gundopharron.  \\n\nWithin Eastern Christianity, the Magi have varied names. Among Syrian Christians , they are Larvandad , Gushnasaph , and Hormisdas;  in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church , they are Hor , Karsudan , and Basanater , while Armenian Catholics have Kagpha , Badadakharida and Badadilma .   \\n\nMany Chinese Christians believe that one of the magi came from China.  \\n\nThe phrase \"from the east\" ( \\xe1\\xbc\\x80\\xcf\\x80\\xe1\\xbd\\xb8 \\xe1\\xbc\\x80\\xce\\xbd\\xce\\xb1\\xcf\\x84\\xce\\xbf\\xce\\xbb\\xe1\\xbf\\xb6\\xce\\xbd , apo anatolon ), more literally \"from the rising [of the sun]\", is the only information Matthew provides about the region from which they came. The Parthian Empire , centered in Iran ( Persia ), stretched from eastern Syria to the fringes of India. Though the empire was tolerant of other religions, its dominant religion was Zoroastrianism , with its priestly magos class.  \\n\nAlthough Matthew\\'s account does not explicitly cite the motivation for their journey (other than seeing the star in the east, which they took to be the star of the King of the Jews), the apocryphal Syriac Infancy Gospel states in its third chapter that they were pursuing a prophecy from their prophet, Zoradascht (Zoroaster).  \\n\nThere is an Armenian tradition identifying the \"Magi of Bethlehem\" as Balthasar of Arabia, Melchior of Persia, and Caspar of India.  Historian John of Hildesheim relates a tradition in the ancient Silk Road city of Taxila (in present-day Punjab, Pakistan) that one of the Magi passed through the city on the way to Bethlehem.  \\n\nSebastian Brock, a historian of Christianity, has said: \"It was no doubt among converts from Zoroastrianism that ... certain legends were developed around the Magi of the Gospels\".   And Anders Hultg\\xc3 5rd concluded that the Gospel story of the Magi was influenced by an Iranian legend concerning magi and a star, which was connected with Persian beliefs in the rise of a star predicting the birth of a ruler and with myths describing the manifestation of a divine figure in fire and light.  \\n\nA model for the homage of the Magi might have been provided, it has been suggested, by the journey to Rome of King Tiridates I of Armenia , with his magi, to pay homage to the Emperor Nero , which took place in AD 66, a few years before the date assigned to the composition of the Gospel of Matthew.   \\n\nThere was a tradition that the Central Asian Naimans and their Christian relatives, the Keraites , were descended from the biblical Magi.  This heritage passed to the Mongol dynasty of Genghis Khan when Sorghaghtani , niece of the Keraite ruler Toghrul , married Tolui , the youngest son of Genghis, and became the mother of M\\xc3\\xb6ngke Khan and his younger brother and successor, Kublai Khan . Toghrul became identified with the legendary Central Asian Christian king Prester John , whose Mongol descendants were sought as allies against the Muslims by contemporary European monarchs and popes.  Sempad the Constable , elder brother of King Hetoum I of Cilician Armenia , visited the Mongol court in Karakorum in 1247-1250 and in 1254. He wrote a letter to Henry I King of Cyprus and Queen Stephanie (Sempad\\'s sister) from Samarkand in 1243, in which he said: \"Tanchat [Tangut, or Western Xia ], which is the land from whence came the Three Kings to Bethlehem to worship the Lord Jesus which was born. And know that the power of Christ has been, and is, so great, that the people of that land are Christians; and the whole land of Chata [Khitai, or Kara-Khitai ] believes those Three Kings. I have myself been in their churches and have seen pictures of Jesus Christ and the Three Kings, one offering gold, the second frankincense, and the third myrrh. And it is through those Three Kings that they believe in Christ, and that the Chan and his people have now become Christians.\"  The legendary Christian ruler of Central Asia Prester John was reportedly a descendant of one of the Magi.  \\n\nIn her four volumes of visions of the life of Christ, Anne Catherine Emmerich says that the Magi came from the border between Chaldea and Elam , mentioning Ur , \"Mozian\" (Iraq\\'s Maysan Province , anciently known as Mesene ), \"Sikdor\" ( Shushtar , near Susa ), and a \"city, whose name sounded to me something like Acajaja\" ( Aghajari ), as well as other cities farther east.  \\n\nApart from their names, the three Magi developed distinct characteristics in Christian tradition, so that between them they represented the three ages of (adult) man, three geographical and cultural areas, and sometimes other concepts. In one tradition, reflected in art by at least the 14th century\\xe2\\x80\\x94for example, in the Arena Chapel by Giotto in 1305\\xe2\\x80\\x94Caspar is old, normally with a white beard, and gives the gold; he is \"King of Tarsus , land of merchants\" on the Mediterranean coast of modern Turkey, and is first in line to kneel to Christ. Melchior is middle-aged, giving frankincense from Arabia , and Balthazar is a young man, very often and increasingly black-skinned, with myrrh from Saba (modern southern Yemen). Their ages were often given as 60, 40 and 20 respectively, and their geographical origins were rather variable, with Balthazar increasingly coming from Aksum or other parts of Africa, and being represented accordingly.  \\n\nBalthazar\\'s blackness has been the subject of considerable recent scholarly attention; in art, it is found mostly in northern Europe, beginning from the 12th century, and becoming very common in the north by the 15th.  The subject of which king is which and who brought which gift is not without some variation depending on the tradition. The gift of gold is sometimes associated with Melchior as well,  and in some traditions Melchior is the oldest of the three Magi.  \\n\nThe Magi are described as \"falling down\", \"kneeling\", or \"bowing\" in the worship of Jesus.  This gesture, together with Luke\\'s birth narrative, had an important effect on Christian religious practices. [ citation needed ] They were indicative of great respect, and typically used when venerating a king. While prostration is now rarely practised in the West, it is still relatively common in the Eastern Churches, especially during Lent . Kneeling has remained an important element of Christian worship to this day.\\n\nGifts of the Magi\nThree gifts are explicitly identified in Matthew: gold , frankincense and myrrh ; in Koine Greek , these are chrysós ( \\xcf\\x87\\xcf\\x81\\xcf\\x85\\xcf\\x83\\xcf\\x8c\\xcf\\x82 ), líbanos ( \\xce\\xbb\\xce f\\xce\\xb2\\xce\\xb1\\xce\\xbd\\xce\\xbf\\xcf\\x82 ) and sm\\xc3\\xbdrna ( \\xcf\\x83\\xce\\xbc\\xcf\\x8d\\xcf\\x81\\xce\\xbd\\xce\\xb1 ). There are various theories and interpretations of the meaning and symbolism of the gifts, particularly with respect to frankincense and myrrh.\\n\nThe theories generally break down into two groups:\\n\nFrankincense and myrrh were burned during rituals among Egyptian, Greek and Roman societies. Ancient Egyptians used myrrh to embalm corpses and Romans burned it as a type of incense at funeral pyres.  Myrrh was used as an embalming ointment and as a penitential incense in funerals and cremations until the 15th century. The \"holy oil\" traditionally used by the Eastern Orthodox Church for performing the sacraments of chrismation and unction is traditionally scented with myrrh, and receiving either of these sacraments is commonly referred to as \"receiving the myrrh\". The picture of the Magi on the 7th-century Franks Casket shows the third visitor - he who brings myrrh - with a valknut over his back, a pagan symbol referring to Death.  \\n\nIt has been suggested by scholars that the \"gifts\" were medicinal rather than precious material for tribute .    \\n\nThe Syrian King Seleucus I Nicator is recorded to have offered gold, frankincense and myrrh (among other items) to Apollo in his temple at Didyma near Miletus in 288/7 BC,  and this may have been the precedent for the mention of these three gifts in Gospel of Matthew ( 2:11 ). It was these three gifts, it is thought, which were the chief cause for the number of the Magi becoming fixed eventually at three.  \\n\nThis episode can be linked to Isaiah 60 and to Psalm 72 , which report gifts being given by kings, and this has played a central role in the perception of the Magi as kings, rather than as astronomer-priests. In a hymn of the late 4th-century Hispanic poet Prudentius , the three gifts have already gained their medieval interpretation as prophetic emblems of Jesus\\' identity, familiar in the carol \" We Three Kings \" by John Henry Hopkins, Jr. , 1857.\\n\nJohn Chrysostom suggested that the gifts were fit to be given not just to a king but to God, and contrasted them with the Jews\\' traditional offerings of sheep and calves, and accordingly Chrysostom asserts that the Magi worshiped Jesus as God.\\n\nWhat subsequently happened to these gifts is never mentioned in the scripture, but several traditions have developed.  One story has the gold being stolen by the two thieves who were later crucified alongside Jesus. Another tale has it being entrusted to and then misappropriated by Judas . One tradition suggests that Joseph and Mary used the gold to finance their travels when they fled Bethlehem after an angel had warned, in a dream, about King Herod\\'s plan to kill Jesus. And another story proposes the theory that the myrrh given to them at Jesus\\' birth was used to anoint Jesus\\' body after his crucifixion.\\n\nThere was a 15th-century golden case purportedly containing the Gift of the Magi housed in the Monastery of St. Paul of Mount Athos . It was donated to the monastery in the 15th century by Mara Brankovi\\xc4\\x87 , daughter of the King of Serbia \\xc4\\x90ura\\xc4\\x91 Brankovi\\xc4\\x87 , wife to the Ottoman Sultan Murat II and godmother to Mehmet II the Conqueror (of Constantinople ). After the Athens earthquake of September 7, 1999, they were temporarily displayed in Athens to strengthen faith and raise money for earthquake victims. The relics were displayed in Ukraine and Belarus in Christmas of 2014, and thus left Greece for the first time since the 15th century.  \\n\nAccording to the book The Travels of Marco Polo , gold symbolises the power over the material world as a king on earth, frankincense symbolises the power over the spiritual world as a deity, and myrrh symbolises the healing power over death.\\n\nReligious significance and traditions\nHolidays celebrating the arrival of the Magi traditionally recognise a distinction between the date of their arrival and the date of Jesus\\' birth. The account given in the Gospel of Matthew does not state that they were present on the night of the birth; in the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary remain in Bethlehem until it is time for Jesus\\' dedication in Jerusalem, after which they return to their home in Nazareth.\\n\nThe visit of the Magi is commemorated in most Western Christian churches separately from Christmas. The visit of the Magi is part of the Epiphany on 6 January, which concludes the twelve days of Christmas ; on that date the Magi are also celebrated as saints.\\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox and Greek Orthodox celebrate the visit of the Magi on the same date as their Christmas, which is either 25 December, 6 January, or 7 January, depending on if they follow the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar .  \\n\nThe Quran does not contain Matthew\\'s episode of the Magi. However, the Persian Muslim encyclopedist al-Tabari , writing in the ninth century, gives the familiar symbolism of the gifts of the Magi, citing the late seventh century Persian-Yemenite writer Wahb ibn Munabbih .  \\n\nIn much of the Spanish-speaking world , the Three Kings ( Los Reyes Magos de Oriente , Los Tres Reyes Magos or simply Los Reyes Magos ) receive letters from children and so bring them gifts on the night before Epiphany . In Spain , each one of the Magi is supposed to represent a different continent: Europe (Melchior), Asia (Caspar) and Africa (Balthasar). According to the tradition, the Magi come from the Orient on their camels to visit the houses of all the children, much like Sinterklaas and Santa Claus with his reindeer elsewhere. \\n\nAlmost every Spanish city or town organises cabalgatas in the evening, in which the kings and their servants parade and throw sweets to the children (and parents) in attendance. The cavalcade of the three kings in Alcoy claims to be the oldest in the world, having started in 1886. The Mystery Play of the Three Magic Kings is also presented on Epiphany Eve. There is also a \"Roscón\" (Spain) or \"Rosca de Reyes\" (Mexico). \\n\nIn Spain, the role of Balthazar has always been played by a Spaniard, or \"white\" person, in blackface . Because so many people have become increasingly offended by this, a campaign of protest to eliminate this practice began in Spain in 2009.  [ non-primary source needed ]  [ non-primary source needed ] \\n\nIn Spain and also in Latin America, children prepare a drink for each of the Magi on January 5. It is also traditional to prepare food and drink for the camels, because it is believed that this is the only night of the year when they eat.\\n\nNot only in Spain, but also in Argentina , Mexico , Paraguay and Uruguay , there is a long tradition of children receiving presents by the three \" Reyes Magos \" on the night of January 5th (Epiphany Eve) or Epiphany morning, January 6th, Día de Reyes , because it is believed that this is the day in which the Magi arrived bearing gifts for the Christ child. In most Latin American countries children also cut grass or greenery on January 5 and fill a box or their shoes with the cuttings for the Kings\\' camels. They then place the box or their shoes under their bed or beside the Christmas tree.  On Epiphany morning the children will find the grass gone from their shoes or box and replaced with candy and other small, sweet treats.  \\n\nIn Spain and most Latin American countries, which are predominantly Roman Catholic , the Christmas Season officially starts on December 25 and partially ends on January 7, the day  after The Epiphany. In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico , however, there are eight more days of celebration called las octavitas (the little eight days). According to the Catholic Church , the full Christmas Season is from December 25 to Candlemas on February 2. \\n\nIn the Philippines, beliefs concerning the Three Kings (Filipino: Tatlóng Haring Mago , lit. \"Three Magi Kings\"; shortened to Tatlóng Har\\xc3 c or Spanish Tres Reyes ) follows Hispanic influence, with the Feast of the Epiphany considered by many Filipinos as the traditional end of their Christmas season . The tradition of the Three Kings\\' cabalgata is today done only in some areas, such as the old city of Intramuros in Manila , and the island of Marinduque . Another dying custom is children leaving shoes out on Epiphany Eve, so that they may receive sweets and money from the Three Kings. With the arrival of American culture in the early 20th century, the Three Kings as gift-givers have been largely replaced in urban areas by Santa Claus , and they only survive in the greeting \"Happy Three Kings!\" and the surname Tatlónghar\\xc3 c . The Three Kings are especially revered in Gapan, Nueva Ecija , where they are enshrined as patron saints in the National Shrine of Virgen La Divina Pastora . [ citation needed ] \\n\nA tradition in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and German-speaking Catholic areas is the writing of the three kings\\' initials [ c ] above the main door of Catholic homes in chalk. This is a new year\\'s blessing for the occupants and the initials also are believed to also stand for \" Christus mansionem benedicat \" (\"May/Let Christ Bless This House\").  Depending on the city or town, this will be happen sometime between Christmas and the Epiphany, with most municipalities celebrating closer to the Epiphany . Also in Catholic parts of the German-speaking world, these markings are made by the Sternsinger (literally, \" star singers \") - a group of children dressed up as the magi.  The Sternsinger carry a star representing the one followed by the biblical magi and sing Christmas carols as they go door to door, such as \" Stern über Bethlehem \". After singing, the children write the three kings\\' initials on the door frame in exchange for charitable donations. Each year, German and Austrian dioceses pick one charity towards which all Sternsinger donations nationwide will be contributed. [ citation needed ] \\n\nTraditionally, one child in the Sternsinger group is said to represent Baltasar from Africa and so, that child typically wears blackface makeup.    Many Germans do not consider this to be racist because it is not intended to be a negative portrayal of a black person, but rather, a \"realistic\" or \"traditional\" portrayal of one.  The dialogue surrounding the politics of traditions involving blackface is not as developed as in Spain or the Netherlands. [ citation needed ] In the past, photographs of German politicians together with children in blackface have caused a stir in English-language press.   Moreover, Afro-Germans have written that this use of blackface is a missed opportunity to be truly inclusive of Afro-Germans in German-speaking communities and contribute to the equation of \"blackness\" with \"foreignness\" and \"otherness\" in German culture.  \\n\nIn 2010, Epiphany was made a holiday in Poland, thus reviving a pre-World War II tradition.  Since 2011, celebrations with biblical costuming have taken place throughout the country. For example, in Warsaw there are processions from Plac Zamkowy down Krakowskie Przedmie\\xc5\\x9bcie to Plac Pi\\xc5\\x82sudskiego .  \\n\nIn Spain and Portugal, a ring-shaped cake (in Portuguese: bolo-rei  ) contains both a small figurine of one of the Magi (or another surprise depending on the region) and a dry broad bean . The one who gets the figurine is \"crowned\" (with a crown made of cardboard or paper), but whoever gets the bean has to pay the value of the cake to the person who originally bought it. In Mexico they also have the same ring-shaped cake Rosca de Reyes (Kings Bagel or Thread) with figurines inside it. Whoever gets a figurine is supposed to organize and be the host of the family celebration for the Candelaria feast on February 2.\\n\nIn France and Belgium, a cake containing a small figure of the baby Jesus, known as the \"broad bean\", is shared within the family. Whoever gets the bean is crowned king for the remainder of the holiday and wears a cardboard crown purchased with the cake. A similar practice is common in many areas of Switzerland, but the figurine is a miniature king. The practice is known as tirer les Rois (Drawing the Kings). A queen is sometimes also chosen.\\n\nIn New Orleans , Louisiana , parts of southern Texas , and surrounding regions, a similar ring-shaped cake known as a \" King Cake \" traditionally becomes available in bakeries from Epiphany to Mardi Gras . The baby Jesus figurine is inserted into the cake from underneath, and the person who gets the slice with the figurine is expected to buy or bake the next King Cake. There is wide variation among the types of pastry that may be called a King Cake, but most are a baked cinnamon-flavoured twisted dough with thin frosting and additional sugar on top in the traditional Mardi Gras colours of gold, green and purple. To prevent accidental injury or choking, the baby Jesus figurine is frequently not inserted into the cake at the bakery, but included in the packaging for optional use by the buyer to insert it themselves. Mardi Gras-style beads and doubloons may be included as well.\\n\nChristian scriptures record nothing about the biblical Magi after reporting that they returned to their own country. [ d ] The Chronicon of Dexter, a martyrological text ascribed to Flavius Lucius Dexter , the bishop of Barcelona under Theodosius the Great (379-396) describes \"the martyrdom of the holy kings, the three Magi, Gaspar, Balthassar, and Melchior who adored Christ.\" in \" Arabia Felix , in the city of Sessania of the Adrumeti\".  First appearing in 1610, the Chronicon of Dexter was immensely popular throughout the 17th century, particularly in Spain. However, by the 19th century, certain historians and Catholic officials in Rome declared the work a pious forgery.  \\n\nAnother competing tradition, most likely originating from Germany, likewise asserts that the biblical Magi were martyred for their faith, albeit without further details.  \\n\nThere are several traditions on where the remains of the Magi are located, none of which have been verified or given veracity by secular historians.\\n\nMarco Polo claimed that he was shown the three tombs of the Magi at Saveh , south of Tehran in present day Iran, in the 1270s:\\n\nIn Persia is the city of Saba , from which the Three Magi set out when they went to worship Jesus Christ; and in this city they are buried, in three very large and beautiful monuments, side by side. And above them there is a square building, carefully kept. The bodies are still entire, with the hair and beard remaining.\nPaul William Roberts provides some modern-day corroboration of this possibility in his book Journey of the Magi .  \\n\nThe bones of the Magi are allegedly contained at the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral in Germany. According to tradition, they were first discovered by Helena , mother of Constantine the Great , on her famous pilgrimage to Palestine and the Holy Lands in 326-28. She took the remains to the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople ; in 344, they were transferred to Milan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in some accounts by the city\\'s bishop, Eustorgius I \\xe2\\x80\\x94where they were interned in a special tomb beneath its basilica.  In 1162, following the conquest of the city by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I , the Magi\\'s remains were transferred to Cologne Cathedral at the behest of its archbishop, Rainald von Dassel . In response to growing pilgrimages to the relics, von Dassel\\'s successor, Philipp von Hochstaden, commissioned the current Shrine of the Three Kings in the late 12th century, which remains widely visited and venerated.  The Milanese treated the fragments of masonry from their now-empty tomb as secondary relics, which were widely distributed around the region, including southern France; this accounts for the frequency with which the Magi appear on chasse reliquaries in Limoges enamel produced in the region.  The city continues to celebrate its part in the tradition by holding a medieval costume parade every 6 January.\\n\nA version of this account is conveyed by 14th century cleric John of Hildesheim in Historia Trium Regum (\"History of the Three Kings\"), which begins with the journey of Helena to Jerusalem, where she recovered the True Cross and other relics:\\n\nQueen Helen... began to think greatly of the bodies of these three kings, and she arrayed herself, and accompanied by many attendants, went into the Land of Ind... after she had found the bodies of Melchior, Balthazar, and Gaspar, Queen Helen put them into one chest and ornamented it with great riches, and she brought them into Constantinople... and laid them in a church that is called Saint Sophia.\nCultural depictions\nMost depictions of the Magi in European art focus on their visit to Jesus ; beginning in the Late Middle Ages , the Journey of the Magi, the Magi before Herod and the Dream of the Magi. In Byzantine art they are depicted as Persians, wearing trousers and phrygian caps . Crowns appear from the 10th century. Despite being saints, they are very often shown without halos , perhaps to avoid distracting attention from either their crowns or the halos of the Holy Family . Sometimes only the lead king, kneeling to Christ, has a halo the two others lack, probably indicating that the two behind had not yet performed the act of worship that would ensure their status as saints. Medieval artists also allegorised the theme to represent the three ages of man . Beginning in the 12th century, and very often by the 15th, the Kings also represent the three parts of the known ( pre-Columbian ) world in Western art, especially in Northern Europe. Balthasar is thus represented as a young African or Moor , and Caspar may be depicted with distinctly Oriental features.\\n\nAn early Anglo-Saxon depiction survives on the Franks Casket (early 7th century, whalebone carving), the only Christian scene, which is combined with pagan and classical imagery. In its composition it follows the oriental style, which renders a courtly scene, with the Virgin and Christ facing the spectator, while the Magi devoutly approach from the (left) side. Even amongst non-Christians who had heard of the Christian story of the Magi, the motif was quite popular, since the Magi had endured a long journey and were generous. Instead of an angel, the picture places a swan-like bird, perhaps interpretable as the hero\\'s fylgja (a protecting spirit, and shapeshifter ).\\n\nAustrian artist Gottfried Helnwein depicted a more controversial tableau in his painting, Epiphany I: Adoration of the Magi (1996). Intended to represent the \"many connections between the Third Reich and the Christian churches in Austria and Germany\",  Nazi officers in uniform stand around an Aryan Madonna. The Christ toddler who stands on Mary\\'s lap resembles Adolf Hitler .  \\n\nMore generally they appear in popular Nativity scenes and other Christmas decorations that have their origins in the Neapolitan variety of the Italian presepio or Nativity cr\\xc3 8che.\\n\nSome Christmas carols refer to the biblical Magi or Three Kings, especially hymns meant to be sung by the star singers , such as \" Stern über Bethlehem \". Peter Cornelius composed a song cycle, Weihnachtslieder , Op. 8, which contain the song \"Die K\\xc3\\xb6nige\" (The Kings), which became popular in an English choral arrangement, \" The Three Kings \". Balthazar, Caspar, and Melchior are also featured in Gian Carlo Menotti \\'s 1951 opera Amahl and the Night Visitors . The popular carol \" We Three Kings \" is another example. Johann Sebastian Bach\\'s Cantata #65 \"Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen\" (\"All they from Saba shall come\") also tells about the Wise Men, based on the Old Testament prophesy found in Isaiah 60:6 (\"A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come.  They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praise of the Lord.\")\\n\nNumerous films have included these characters in some scenes depicting the Nativity, from The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ (1897) to The Star (2017). In 2003, the spanish animated film The 3 Wise Men was released, directed by Antonio Navarro and nominated for the Goya Awards .\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nNotes \\n\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBiblioteca Carnegie\nThe Biblioteca Carnegie (or Carnegie Library ) on Avenida Juan Ponce de León in Puerta de Tierra , San Juan, Puerto Rico  is a NRHP -listed Carnegie library funded through a $100,000 donation from the Carnegie Foundation ,  becoming Puerto Rico\\'s first purpose-built library  when it was completed in 1915.  \\n\nHistory\nIn 1901, then- Education Commissioner , Martin Grove Brumbaugh , initiated talks with Andrew Carnegie with the purpose of building a public library in San Juan,  as part of the United States\\' Puerto Rican education program .  For this, the San Juan municipal legislature had agreed to give $6,000 for maintenance expenses. Carnegie\\'s private secretary, James Bertram , indicated that the amount usually donated was 10 times the promised maintenance expenses. Nevertheless, Brumbaugh obtained the $100,000 amount.  This was in part due to then- Governor Arthur Yager\\'s friendship with Carnegie himself.  Its origins stem from the Insular Library created in 1903, created by the then-new civil government , which itself came from the military-rule era San Juan Free Library, which was a merger of five pre-existing libraries under Spanish-rule: the library of the Dominican and Franciscan monasteries, the Real Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País , the library of the Provincial Council [ es ] and Treasury Department of Puerto Rico , the library of the Royal College of Lawyers-General Secretary and the library of the Institute of Secondary Education and Normal School.   \\n\nIt has a Classical Revival stylings and was designed and built by the Puerto Rican engineer Ramón Carbia in 1914, when work on the project commenced on land donated by the Puerto Rico government.   In June 1916, the collection of the Insular Library, which had previously been known as the San Juan Public Library,  was transferred to the building and the library, which was named Biblioteca Carnegie, itself was inaugurated on 27 July,  when the Puerto Rican government formally accepted the donation.  From 1917 till 2010, the library was administered by the Department of Education .  In its first forty years of service the library had nine reading rooms, membership, with an average of 200 daily visitors.   Under the 222 Law of 1946 a $6,000 amount was made available to the library\\'s board of trustees, with the intent of establishing the Biblioteca Rodante (\"Library on Wheels\"). The then- Department of Public Instruction was authorized to organize and equip the Biblioteca Rodante, which offered it services through the use of cajas viajeras (\"travelling boxes\"), which were shelves used to carry books to isolated schools and communities.  The project started in 1948 under the direction of Federico Porrata Doría, Francisco Porrata-Doría\\'s brother, with two vehicles carrying books for children and adults, as users ranged from elementary-level school children to adults aged eighty to ninety-years old.  \\n\nHowever, in 1965, the library was closed to due the deterioration,   which in response Nilita Vientós Gastón , who had served as president of the neighboring Ateneo Puertorriqueño , penned her essay on the library .  It was remodelled with some alterations on the floors and reopened in 1969,  albeit with a reduced number of visitors, registering 7,000 users that year.  That same year it hosted its first Salón de Humoristas de Puerto Rico (\"Puerto Rico Comedian\\'s Hall\"), which would continue for 22 years, displaying the work of humourists such as Carmelo Filardi , Ramón Arroyo Cisneros [ es ] , Arturo Yépez, José Ramón Cepero, Ismael Rodríguez , Díaz de Villegas among others. The library received commendations from former-Governor Luis Muñoz Marín, who had recently started his vacation in Rome, writing \"Humor is intelligent laughter.\"  \\n\nIn addition, the library was host to the first meetings of the UNESCO Cultural Center in 1973 and held thirty-six \"UNESCO Chamber Music Concerts\" with the likes of Jesús María Sanromá and Héctor Campos Parsi . Ricardo Alegría had talented students from the Escuela de Artes Plásticas y Diseño de Puerto Rico present their \"masterpieces\" at exhibitions held in the library\\'s exhibition hall on the upper floor. It was also the meeting place for the first meetings and exhibitions of the Academy of Heraldic and Historical Studies and the Theatre Board, then directed by Raulito Carbonell\\'s namesake father.  \\n\nDuring the following decades, it closed by season  and had its working hours reduced as a result of lack of funds.  Additionally, in 1989, as a consequence to the significant damages the building suffered during Hurricane Hugo , the library was closed, leaving San Juan without a public library.   In 1991, the Department of Education, \"supported by a group of citizens interested in the library, decided to restore the building.\"  The next year, a law was passed which permitted the Department of Education integrate the community by subdelegating the administration of the library to a governmental agency or NGO. The organization selected was the Biblioteca Carnegie Board of Trustees,  reopening in 1995.  In 2010, the San Juan municipal legislature approved an ordinance to accept the library building, possessions and land from the Department of Education, per a Legislative Assembly resolution.  After which, then- San Juan mayor Jorge Santini commenced the \"total disinterest of the municipality in preserving it\" however \"community efforts have been made to reopen it without success.\"  After the José Julián Acosta Theater Arts School, located a down the street, was declared \"partially not apt for use\" after the 2019-20 Puerto Rico earthquakes , then-mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz announced an agreement with the Department of Education to rehabilitate the library and transfer students temporarily, using 11 classrooms and a recreative area at the library and supplying the use of the Ateneo Puertorriqueño\\'s theatre and the Teatro Tapia , equipment and breakfasts supplied by the municipality, while lunches were the Department\\'s responsibility, as well as Wi-Fi and a radio with direct communication to the municipality\\'s Emergency Management Office and establishing an identification card system for the 182 students and 31 faculty, amounting to a sum of $85,000 investment.   \\n\nDescription\nIn 1983 the state architect of Puerto Rico wrote \"This is a fine Neoclassical, 2-storied building with a rectangular plan.\" but noted that the building \"has not been properly maintained and is in fair condition.\"  : 2-3 \\n\nIt was listed on the NRHP in 1983 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.   \\n\nServices\nPuerto Rico law permits members of the Legislative Assembly , Supreme Court , Court of First Instance [ Wikidata ] and District court judges as well as prosecutors to check out most books for a maximum of thirty days.  Among the collection there were books from the collections from three Princes of Wales , three Medieval abbots and Ludwig II .  When the library closed after Hurricane Hugo it was open seven days a week, had rooms for references, circulation, magazines, teenagers, children, computer, movies and cultural events, as well as virtual references and night galleries.  \\n\nThe library held alliances with the Pedro Henríquez Ureña National Library as well as Juan Bosch himself, it hosted a camp for children below the poverty line, with meals provided by the Department of Education\\'s school cafeterias. Its bebeteca (\"baby\\'s library\") hosted children\\'s festival, while it held \"la hora del cuento (\"story hour\") with older children. The teenagers\\' room had book and computers, prepared for their homework or entertainment. It also hosted computer classes for the elderly, and invited the homeless to use their facilities as well.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPonce Municipal Library\n\\n\nWithin the city: \\n\nOutside the city: \\n\nThe Ponce Municipal Library , formally, Biblioteca Municipal Mariana Suárez de Longo (English: Mariana Suárez de Longo Municipal Library), and also known as Biblioteca Publica de Ponce (English: Ponce Public Library), is the library system of the municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico . Founded in 1870, it is the oldest public library in Puerto Rico.  The system has its main library on Miguel Pou Boulevard , in barrio San Antón , in the city of Ponce, and seven satellite library branches, three in the city\\'s urban area and four spread out in the municipality\\'s rural areas. The main library inaugurated a new building on Bulevar Miguel Pou in August 2007,   where the former Puerto Rico District Court building was located.  The central library building on Bulevar Miguel Pou was designed by Ponce architect Juan Dalmau Sambolín.  \\n\nHistory\nThe origins of the Ponce Municipal Library date to the establishment in Ponce of the \"Gabinete de Lectura\" in 1869-1870, founded by Alejandro Tapia y Rivera .     The books from the Gabinete de Lectura , the personal collection of Don Miguel Rosich and miscellaneous purchases were used to stock the Public Library.  The Gabinete de Lectura was the first educational, cultural, and scientific center in Ponce.  The Gabinete was established in 1870 by Federico Perez, Antonio Molina Jr., Diego Vicente Texeira, Rafael Rodriguez, Luis R. Velazquez, Angel Aguerrevera, and Eduardo Neumann Gandía , and was located on Calle Sol.  The central government in San Juan closed it down in 1874 out of fear that the common people would become educated and rebel against the government. However, it was reopened in 1876 by a group of people that included some of its original founders plus Dr. Rafael Pujals , Oscar Schuck, Alfredo Casals, Antonio Molina, Ramon Rivera, Jacobo Tur, Sergio Cuevas Zequeira, Juan Cuevas Aboy, Oriol Pasarell, Francisco Oliver, Manuel Mayoral Barnes, and Manuel Yordan.  It was re-established on 8 April 1877 with Rafael Pujals , Jose A. Renta, Julio Chardon, Ramon Marin , Baldomero San Antonio, Luis Lassise, Antonio Perez Guerra, Eduardo Salichs, Juan J. Mayoral, Pedro P. Valdivieso, Eduardo Neumann Gandia , Rafael Rodriguez, and Luis Velazquez as its directors.  \\n\nThe Ponce Municipal Library was formally founded in 1890   and re-organized in 1894.  This first library was located on the first floor of Casa Alcaldia building,  on what is now Calle Plaza Degetau , but at the time was considered part of Calle Villa. It contained 1,500 volumes that came from the \"Gabinete de Lectura\", the private collection of Manuel Rosich, a prominent local educator, and donations from citizens at large.  The first librarian was Joaquin Figueroa.  The library started with 809 books and 669 pamphlets.  By 1913, the total number of volumes was over 4,754,  including 2,818 books and 1,936 periodicals.  In 1937, the library was restarted under the leadership of Luis A. Ferre .  The library later relocated to Calle Isabel in the Ponce Historic Zone . In 1940, mayor Jose Tormos Diego reconditioned the northern annex of Teatro La Perla to be used as the headquarters of the Ponce municipal library.  \\n\nOriginally a non-circulating library, in 1945 the Ponce Public Library instituted a home loan system guaranteed by deposits. The majority of its readers were school children.  By 1946 the Ponce Public Library collection had increased to 9,648 volumes, mostly of general character, but completely catalogued according to the Dewey system .  In 1946 the library was mostly supported by the Ponce Lions Club and the Asociación Bibliotecaria de Puerto Rico, a sort of \"friends of the library\" organization.  At least by 1947, the library was located on the second level of the Teatro La Perla .  Luis A. Ferre was one of the sponsors of the Ponce Public Library and, in the 1950s, several of the works of art that would later be part of the collections at Museo de Arte de Ponce , first hung from the walls of the Public Library on the second floor of Teatro La Perla.  \\n\nIn 1971, construction on the north side of Teatro La Perla was completed   and, during the administration of mayor Juan H. Cintron (1968-1972), the library moved to new facilities next to Teatro La Perla,  where it remained until 2007.   \\n\nConstruction of the new facility at Bulevar Miguel Pou started in December 2004, completed in January 2007, and the library opened in April 2007.  The building cost was $8.5M USD, with another $2M used to furnish it, for a total cost of $10.5M.  \\n\nThe city moved its central library to the new facility in August 2007.   The modern facility opened over three years after the untimely death of its proud mastermind and instigator, \"the beloved Ponce Mayor Rafael Churumba Cordero \".  \\n\nMain library building\nThe main library is located in a new building on Miguel Pou Boulevard, barrio San Anton, Ponce, at 18° 0\\' 44\" N, 66° 36\\' 12\" W. The new structure opened in August 2007 under the administration of Mayor Francisco Zayas Seijo  and cost $14 million to build.  The new building is located at the site of the old Tribunal de Ponce (English: Ponce Judicial Center),  which was demolished to give way for the library.\\n\nFacilities also include an exhibition hall for art expositions and other similar public events of cultural and civic nature. The library\\'s courtyard provides unrestricted wireless Internet access per the library\\'s hotspot policy and provides an environment suitable for book presentations, storytelling activities, lectures and cocktails.  \\n\nThe Main Library was named after Mariana Suárez de Longo, a much admired \"Teacher of Teachers\". Suarez de Longo was born on 3 January 1906 in Aibonito, Puerto Rico , graduated from Ponce High School in 1923, and obtained a bachelor\\'s degree in education from the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras in 1935.  Suarez de Longo then committed almost 40 years of her life to the education of the island\\'s youth. In 1946, she became the first Puerto Rican woman to be designated School Superintendent, commanding the Ponce area from 1950 to 1962. In 1954 she obtained a master\\'s degree in Management and Supervision from New York University .  From 1963 to 1966 she directed the Department of Education 's southern region, comprising fourteen municipalities . In 1966 she served as director of the Division of Curriculum of Puerto Rico\\'s Department of Education. In 1969, Suarez de Longo directed the Staff Training Center of the Ponce Municipal Head Start program.  The devoted educator retired in 1972.  She died in Ponce on 13 January 1995.  \\n\nSatellite libraries\nIn 2018, another digital center was located at the Ponce Servicios building.  \\n\nResearch branch\nOriginally envisioned to be co-located with the public library was the Archivo Histórico de Ponce (Ponce Historical Archive). The Archivo Histórico de Ponce is a library research tool about the municipality, and is currently (2011) located on Calle Marina and Plaza Degetau in the Ponce Historic Zone .  In 2016, it moved to the renovated Ponce Servicios Building.\\n\nThe Ponce Historical Archive boasts collections of newspapers published in the city from the 18th through the 21st century, including La Gaceta de Puerto Rico, El Aguila de Puerto Rico, El Universal, El Diario de Puerto Rico among others.  Also archived there is La Perla del Sur .\\n\nServices\nThe Ponce Municipal Library offers among its services a nearly half-million dollars virtual education center with access to over 30 digital services covering subjects from Auto Repair to Health and Medicine to Literature to encyclopedias and dictionaries with a fleet of some 150 computers. There is a Mi Rincón de Lectura (English: Children\\'s Reading Corner) providing a setting for parents who want to read to their kids. The two-story main library structure also has a youth library, sponsored by the international children\\'s literature introductory program known as PIALI, Programa Internacional de Acercamiento a la Literatura Infantil (English: International Children\\'s Literature Introductory Program).  The library is also a center for the temporary exposition of visual arts.  \\n\nHead librarians\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBirth of the New World\n\\n\\n\nThe Birth of the New World  is a 360 foot (110 m) bronze sculpture located on the Atlantic coastline of Arecibo, Puerto Rico . When completed in 2016, it became the tallest sculpture in North America ,  (as well as the tallest not only in the United States , but in the Western Hemisphere in general) surpassing Mexico\\'s Guerrero Chimalli (which measures 200 feet or 61 meters in height including its base), and the fourth tallest worldwide, after the Statue of Unity in India (597 ft; 182 m), the Spring Temple Buddha in China (420 ft; 130 m), and the Laykyun Sekkya in Myanmar (380 ft; 120 m). After being imported to Puerto Rico, there were plans for it to be erected in Cataño . After being moved to Mayagüez and facing further delays, Birth of the New World was assembled at its current location.\\n\nHistory\nOriginally designed by Georgian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli as a monument to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus \\'s first voyage , Birth of the New World was constructed in 1991. The statue prominently depicts Columbus controlling an anachronistic depiction of a steering wheel, with a backdrop featuring the Niña , Pinta and Santa María traversing the Atlantic Ocean.  Made of 2,750 bronze and steel pieces and weighing more than 1,300,000 pounds (650 short tons; 590 tonnes), the monument\\'s 360 ft (110 m) height made it the tallest in the Western Hemisphere during the last decade of the 20th century, dwarfing the Statue of Liberty  and the Monumento a la Virgen de la Paz .\\n\nTsereteli offered Birth of the New World to the cities of Baltimore , Fort Lauderdale , Miami Beach , New York City and Columbus, Ohio , but none of those cities accepted it, considering it an eyesore due to its disproportionate features or because its size would affect their skylines.  Amid its long search for a home, the statue gathered the derisive nicknames of \"Chris Kong\", \"Robo-Columbus\", and \"From Russia with Ugh\" while searching for a base.   Despite the hindrances, the monument was featured in a stamp.  A smaller and modified version, named The Birth of a New Man and meant to be the European link of a two-part composition along with Birth of the New World , was adopted by Seville , Spain, and dedicated there in 1995.  \\n\nIn 1991, New York City was the first to be offered the statue. Tseretali proposed erecting the statue on Roosevelt Island . However, this plan was met with concerns of its size, as it would visually dwarf the Statue of Liberty, yet be dwarfed itself by skyscrapers of the city\\'s skyline that sat near Roosevelt Island.  Plans for it to be located in New York City were briefly resurrected in 1997 when then-real estate developer Donald Trump proposed that the statue be at his development of rail yards , but this was nixed by city leadership including mayor Rudy Giuliani .   \\n\nIn 1992, the Miami area was offered the statue, after financier and investor Bennett S. LeBow sought to see it erected at South Pointe in Miami Beach, near the Government Cut entrance of the Port of Miami .    Supporters argued that it had the potential to become an icon for the City of Miami.  The sculpture attracted local criticism, including for the fact that the design included a depiction of a ship\\'s wheel , despite the fact that this device would not supplant the use of tillers for over 250 years after Columbus\\'s first voyage to the Americas.  Native American activist groups also expressed concern over a statue that celebrated a man whom they regarded as a rapist and murderer .  Plans to erect it in Miami ultimately failed due to the large costs associated with erecting the statue.  \\n\nIn 1992, as plans to locate it in Miami were fizzling out, Fort Lauderdale, Florida City Commissioner Gary Keno expressed interest in locating it in his city.  The head of the sculpture was shipped to the city that year, in hopes of stoking support for erecting the statue there.  Keno found little support for displaying the head in a city park.  The head would ultimately remain in a warehouse there for six years.  \\n\nNative American activist groups again expressed concern.  \\n\nIn 1993, the city of Columbus, Ohio was offered the statue.  Governor George V. Voinovich expressed interest, sending a letter of intent .  Proponents argued that it could become an icon for the city, and would be a tourist generator.  The costs associated with erecting the statue, again, posed an issue.  Mayor Greg Lashutka refused to spend any city funds on erecting the statue.  Despite his support for the statue, Governor Voinovich stated that no state money was available to erect the statue.  This would mean that citizens groups would be required to raise as much as $25 million for the statue to be erected in Columbus.  Additionally, Native American activist groups again raised concern.   The statue also met criticism for its massive size and criticisms that it would appear gaudy.   \\n\nIn 1995, Tsereteli sought to convince the city of St. Petersburg, Florida to become the home of his statue.  However, his overtures were met with large disinterest by the city.  \\n\nIn 1997, there was an effort to locate the statue in Baltimore \\'s Inner Harbor .   Locations floated for the statue to be located in the Inner Harbor included Fort Carroll and the site of a former Allied Chemical plant on the east side of the Inner Harbor.  Joseph DiCara, whose construction management firm would be responsible for assembling the statue if it were built in Baltimore, advocated for it to be erected in the city.   Some other local businessmen, local Italian American community leaders, and politicians also lent their support.  Supporters touted its potential as a tourist attraction.  Mayor Kurt Schmoke was initially interested in the prospect of erecting the statue.  However, his office also expressed concern over the city lacking resources to help finance its erection.  Ivan Kazansky, the head of Moscow\\'s Union of Sculptures, advised Baltimore against letting Tsereteli \"ruin\" their harbor.  Additionally, concerns again arose over its size.  \\n\nIn 1998, Edwin \"Amolao\" Rivera Sierra, mayor of the municipality of Cataño in Puerto Rico , decided to acquire the monument. Despite being donated by Tsereteli, the cost of importing the statue was 2.4 million dollars, all of which was taken from the public treasury with the approval of governor Pedro Rosselló .  Rivera Sierra insisted that the municipal treasury would not lose a single cent on the project, and planned to erect the monument near the entrance of Cataño Bay. The unassembled pieces of the statue were relocated to an adjacent recreational park upon arriving on 12 November 1998. In its original plan, construction would have begun in 1999, with the dedication taking place in October 2000. However, the project caused immediate controversy; several homes would have to be destroyed to make way for it and the cost of its assembly was deemed excessive. The Oficina del Contralor (Office of the Comptroller) opened an investigation into the transaction and found that the 1.6 million dollars in taxes that were due when the statue entered the port were not paid. The auditor also investigated the use of public funds to cover the travel expenses of Rivera Sierra when personally meeting Tseretelli in Russia.\\n\nThe height of the monument raised concerns that it would interfere with air traffic to nearby Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport .  Ultimately, the Puerto Rico Port Authority denied Cataño the permits required to advance, citing \"security concerns\". The central government decided to stop providing any funding for the project. The unassembled pieces remained stored near Cataño Bay for several years. Rivera Sierra\\'s successor, Wilson Soto , declared that the municipality would not invest any public funds in the project. By this time, some of the pieces were beginning to show signs of rusting, and storing the pieces was costing $1.6 million in taxes per year, not including the salaries of several security guards.  The municipality also lost an estimated income of $200,000 that the recreational park would have provided were it open to the public. The total cost of the project was re-estimated due to the necessity of replacing several parts and some of the supporting steel structures, fixing exposure damage and the additional need for a sandblasting procedure. In early 2005, Tseretelli began searching for developers that would take over the project. However, these efforts were interrupted by Soto, who considered that simply assembling the statue was not enough to attract tourism. He suggested that the entire area would need to be developed.  The size of the project caused potential developers to lose interest.\\n\nOn 16 August 2008, the municipality confirmed that Birth of a New World had been transferred to Holland Group Port Investment (HGPI), a private group that was involved in the development of the Mayagüez port. Soto justified the action by claiming that simply storing the pieces was costing the public treasury 4 million dollars, and that Cataño could not afford a project that would exceed $100 million.  The private entity transferred the pieces to its facilities in Mayagüez, announcing its intention to assemble the statue near the coastline in time for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games that were being held in that municipality. HGPI devised a plan to attract an estimated 500,000 tourists to with Birth of a New World as its cornerstone. A regional plan would include the establishment of a museum of history near the statue. The possibility of establishing a cruise route between Mayagüez and Seville was also explored. Once there, a Russian team examined the condition of the pieces and ensured that it could still be assembled.\\n\nHGPI was unable to fulfill its plan in time, citing disinterest by the municipal government, and the statue was reassigned for a different project. Arecibo became a frontrunner, and Mayor Lemuel Soto began the permit process for a project that would combine the statue with other attractions, such as the Arecibo Observatory . However, the municipality faced competition; Representative David Bonilla Cortés requested that the statue be assembled on Desecheo Island  and the newly elected mayor of Cataño, José Rosario , proposed using the statue as part of an eco park that would be constructed in the swampy region of Ciénaga las Cucharillas.  San Juan also tentatively considered the project, but lost interest due to the condition of the pieces.  Ultimately, Tseretelli decided that it was \"too late\" to consider other venues and settled for Arecibo. However, once there the monument faced more controversy, this time by activists that condemned Columbus\\' role in opening the door to the European genocide of indigenous peoples and by groups that opposed its impact in the maritime-terrestrial zone.  Eventually, the Luis Fortuño administration began processing the respective permits.\\n\nIn 2012, Rosario denounced the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury for imposing nearly $3 million in retroactive taxes for the original transaction and unfinished projects related to it, resulting in an embargo of the municipality\\'s income.  In June 2012, the first pieces began arriving at Barrio Islote in Arecibo.  Birth of the New World became the main attraction of a tourist project called Columbus Theme Park (later renamed Terravista ParkLand) developed by Pan American Grain, which the administration expected would produce 4.6 million dollars in income per year and recruit 900 new employees. The assembly investment was now estimated at $98 million, with only the reclassification of the zone preventing the project\\'s advance. This process was completed by January 2013.  On 11 February 2014, a contemporary- Taíno movement, named Movimiento Indígena Jíbaro Boricua, joined other anti-Columbus factions in protest the impending assembly of the monument.  \\n\nThe monument survived the passing of Cat. 5 hurricane Maria in September 2017 without structural damage.  However, the adjacent infrastructure was heavily affected.  The remodeling of the beach house (which is expected to host the visitor center), as well as the construction of new roads, parking and a plaza were all halted.  Reforestation efforts in the area were completely reverted after the winds decimated the flora.  These developments forced architect Roberto Alsina to delay the timetable and reconsider strategies, this while working to undo the damage to the area that would host the Terravista ParkLand.  \\n\nOn 14 March 2019, Tsereteli sued González Freyre, Pan American Grain and Columbus Park Corporation, claiming that previous agreements had not been fulfilled as the sculptor\\'s corporation - Birth of New World LLC - had not been refunded an investment of $17 million (for transferring it between Mayagüez and Arecibo) or received ownership of the terrains.  This conflict prevented plans from fully opening to the public and prompted the municipality to change dates for the formal inauguration on multiple occasions.  Tsereteli was stated to be content with the visibility gained by the monument and unconcerned by the possibility of it remaining closed off for the time being.  \\n\nDuring a year, beginning when a contract was signed in November 2013, both sides discussed the transfer of between 766 and 866 yards (700 and 792 m) of the plot to an entity of the author\\'s choosing.  However, González Freyre claims that Tsereteli did not discuss the matter again until he issued a warning in late 2018, after more than a year of no communication, and that the Russian artist did not heed attempts to mediate.  The monument is assembled but the development of the Terravista ParkLand had yet to begin following the hurricane delays and is expected to take up to five years.  In 2021, both sides worked on a settlement to continue the project as a joint venture.  \\n\nEconomic impact\nPrior to the inauguration, an economic study by consulting firm Estudios Técnicos, estimated that the statue would attract at least 300,000 tourists per year to the municipality, with additional income from taxes related to the project.  Shortly after its assembly was completed, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company labelled Birth of the New World a potential anchor attraction for the north region.  In 2019, then-mayor Carlos Molina stated that the increased traffic of people interested in seeing the monument had been the main motivator behind the opening of several new businesses in the municipality.  He considered that Birth of the New World became \"a tourist attraction for the local and foreign visitor\".  He quantified the economic impact as of 2020 at 1,000 new jobs, 100 businesses and 500 property acquisitions.  The volume of people stopping along Puerto Rico Highway 22 (unsigned Interstate PR2) to see the monument motivated a legislative bill to build a lookout and rest area.  \\n\nIn 2021, Ernesto González Rodríguez, town hall secretary of Carlos Ramírez (who succeeded Molina), acknowledged that Columbus is a controversial topic but noted that the tourism that the monument attracts is beneficial to the town\\'s coffers. Despite logistic issues involving the traffic to the area and an international trend of removing statues depicting Columbus, Birth of the New World was considered the main attraction in the area following the collapse of the Arecibo Observatory and the municipal administration opposed the demolition demanded by activists.    Restaurants and bars have been the most benefited from the increased clientele.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBlack sand\nBlack sand is sand that is black in color. One type of black sand is a heavy, glossy, partly magnetic mixture of usually fine sands containing minerals such as magnetite , found as part of a placer deposit . Another type of black sand, found on beaches near a volcano , consists of tiny fragments of basalt .\\n\nWhile some beaches are predominantly made of black sand, even other color beaches (e.g. gold and white) can often have deposits of black sand, particularly after storms. Larger waves can sort out sand grains leaving deposits of heavy minerals visible on the surface of erosion escarpments .\\n\nPlacer deposits\nBlack sands are used by miners and prospectors to indicate the presence of a placer formation. Placer mining activities produce a concentrate that is composed mostly of black sand.  Black sand concentrates often contain additional valuables, other than precious metals: rare earth elements , thorium , titanium , tungsten , zirconium and others are often fractionated during igneous processes into a common mineral-suite that becomes black sands after weathering and erosion.\\n\nSeveral gemstones , such as garnet , topaz , ruby , sapphire , and diamond are found in placers and in the course of placer mining, and sands of these gems are found in black sands and concentrates.  Purple or ruby-colored garnet sand often forms a showy surface dressing on ocean beach placers.\\n\nAn example of a non-volcanic black sand beach is at Langkawi in Malaysia.  \\n\nBasalt fragments\nWhen lava contacts water, it cools rapidly and shatters into sand and fragmented debris of various size.  Much of the debris is small enough to be considered sand.  A large lava flow entering an ocean may produce enough basalt fragments to build a new black sand beach almost overnight.  The famous \"black sand\" beaches of Hawaii, such as Punalu\\xca\\xbbu Beach and Kehena Beach , were created virtually instantaneously by the violent interaction between hot lava and sea water.  Since a black sand beach is made by a lava flow in a one time event, they tend to be rather short lived since sands do not get replenished if currents or storms wash sand into deeper water. For this reason, the state of Hawaii has made it illegal to remove black sand from its beaches. Further, a black sand beach is vulnerable to being inundated by future lava flows, as was the case for Hawai\\xca\\xbbi\\'s Kaim\\xc5 b , usually known simply as Black Sand Beach, and Kalapana beaches.  An even shorter-lived black sand beach was Kamoamoa.  Unlike with white and green sand beaches, walking barefoot on black sand can result in burns, as the black sand absorbs more solar radiation .  \\n\nBeaches\nBlack sand has formed beaches in places including:    \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBobbin lace\nBobbin lace is a lace textile made by braiding and twisting lengths of thread , which are wound on bobbins to manage them. As the work progresses, the weaving is held in place with pins set in a lace pillow , the placement of the pins usually determined by a pattern or pricking pinned on the pillow.\\n\nBobbin lace is also known as pillow lace , because it was worked on a pillow, and bone lace , because early bobbins were made of bone  or ivory .\\n\nBobbin lace is one of the two major categories of handmade laces, the other being needle lace , derived from earlier cutwork and reticella .  \\n\nOrigin\nA will of 1493 by the Milanese Sforza family mentions lace created with twelve bobbins.  There are two books that represent the early known pattern descriptions for bobbin lace, Le Pompe  from Venice and Nüw Modelbuch  from Zürich . Other popular lace pattern books were produced by Isabella Parasole , which included patterns for reticella, needle lace and bobbin lace designs. Other pattern books of this period include Cesare Vecellio  and Bartolomeo Danieli.  \\n\nBobbin lace evolved from passementerie or braid -making in 16th-century Italy .  Genoa was famous for its braids, hence it is not surprising to find bobbin lace developed in the city. It traveled along with the Spanish troops through Europe.  Coarse passements of gold and silver -wrapped threads or colored silks gradually became finer, and later bleached linen yarn was used to make both braids and edgings.  \\n\nThe making of bobbin lace was easier to learn than the elaborate cutwork of the 16th century, and the tools and materials for making linen bobbin lace were inexpensive.  There was a ready market for bobbin lace of all qualities, and women throughout Europe soon took up the craft which earned a better income than spinning , sewing , weaving or other home-based textile arts .  Bobbin lace-making was established in charity schools , almshouses , and convents .  \\n\nIn the 17th century, the textile centers of Flanders and Normandy eclipsed Italy as the premiere sources for fine bobbin lace, but until the Industrial Revolution and the coming of mechanization hand-lacemaking continued to be practiced throughout Europe, suffering only in those periods of simplicity when lace itself fell out of fashion.  \\n\nSome skilled lace makers work to re-create older lace patterns based on the period portraiture and extant lace samples.  On paintings that have sufficient detail, entire pieces can be reconstructed by lacemakers who understand the early structural techniques and details.   \\n\nMaterials\nBobbin lace may be made with coarse or fine threads. Traditionally it was made with linen , silk , wool , or, later, cotton threads, or with precious metals. Bess of Hardwick bought red silk, gold, and silver thread for making \"bone lace\" in 1549, the earliest English reference to this kind of work.  Today bobbin lace is made with a variety of natural and synthetic fibers and with wire and other filaments.  Even bobbin lace made from human hair, point tresse , was once popular as a personal memento.  \\n\nStructure\nElements of bobbin lace may include toile or toilé (clothwork), réseau (the net-like ground of continuous lace), fillings of part laces , tapes, gimp , picots , tallies, ribs and rolls. Not all styles of bobbin lace include all these elements.\\n\nTraditional types\nMany styles of lace were made in the heyday of lacemaking (approximately the 16th-18th centuries) before machine-made lace became available.\\n\nContemporary laces\nThe advent of machine-made lace at first pushed lace-makers into more complicated designs beyond the capabilities of early machines, then simpler designs so they could compete on price, and finally pushed them out of business almost entirely.\\n\nThe resurgence of lace-making is a recent phenomenon and is mostly done as a hobby.  Lacemaking groups still meet in regions as varied as Devonshire , England and Orange County, California .  In the European towns where lace was once a major industry or popular artisanry , especially in Belgium , England, Spain ( Camariñas and Almagro ), Portugal ( Azores , Caminha , Lagos , Nisa , Olh\\xc3 3o , Peniche , Póvoa de Varzim , Sesimbra , Setúbal , Silves , Viana do Castelo , Vila do Conde and Viseu (Farminh\\xc3 3o),  being known as Renda de Bilros ),    France and Slovenia lacemakers still demonstrate the craft and sell their wares, though their customer base has shifted from the wealthy nobility to the curious tourist.\\n\nStill new types of lace are being developed such as the 3D Rosalibre  and a colored version of Milanese lace by borrowing rolls from Duchesse lace to store various shades and colors.  Other artists are giving grounds a major role by distorting and varying stitches, pin distances and thread sizes or colours. The variations are explored by experimentation    and mathematics and algorithms.  The lace maintaining its shape without stiffening is no longer a requirement.  Inspiring journals, guilds and foundations show that old techniques with a new twist can challenge young people to create works that can definitely classify as art.  \\n\nA Dutch design graduate in 2006 discovered bobbin lace was a technique to make a fancy fence. The first fences became museum pieces. The fences are now produced in Bangalore by concrete rebar plaiters.  \\n\nTools\nThe major tools to make bobbin lace are a pillow, bobbins, pins and prickings.  The part laces also require a crochet hook, very fine types of lace require very fine hooks. There are different types of pillows and bobbins linked to areas, eras and type of lace.\\n\nBobbins, which are traditionally made of wood or bone, are used to hold the thread. They come in different shapes, often associated with certain types of lace. The parts of a bobbin are the neck, which is where the thread is wound, a head, where thread is hitched to keep it from coming unwound, and the shank, which is used as a handle. Bobbins from England may also have a beaded spangle at the end of the shank, which makes the bobbin heavier and helps with tensioning the thread.  Bobbins are usually 3 1/2 - 4 inches long, though they may be shorter or longer.  Bobbins are wound and used in pairs. Bobbin collection is a common aspect of the hobby for many lace makers. Within the lace community, commemorative bobbins designating annual meetings, special anniversaries, or historic events are frequently offered which become collector\\'s items.\\n\nThere are many types of bobbins, including:\\n\nThe pillows must be firm, or otherwise the pins will wobble. The pillows were traditionally stuffed with straw, but nowadays polystyrene (styrofoam) is generally used.  \\n\nAn early type of pillow can be seen in The Lace Maker by Caspar Netscher . The pillow has a wooden frame, and is slightly sloping. The lace-maker rests it on her lap. Another representation of the similar style of pillow is found in the painting The Lacemaker by Johannes Vermeer . The Lace-Maker portrait by Gabri\\xc3 bl Metsu was memorialized in a postage stamp .\\n\nThe bolster or cylindrical pillow was much cheaper to make as it is just a fabric bag stuffed with straw. It was used in Bedfordshire lace . It needs a stand as it does not have a flat bottom.  Usually the bolster had the pattern pinned round the cylinder, so by turning the pillow, the lace could be as long as was needed. However, Maltese lacemakers used the pillow the other way. They had a long thin pillow, which they rested against something. Then they worked the lace down the length of the pillow.  \\n\nThis problem (of the lace needing to be longer than the pillow) is solved in a different way by the roller pillow, which has a small roller, for working the lace, set into a larger area, where the bobbins are laid. This means that the pattern can be pinned round the roller, but the pillow has a flat bottom.\\n\nThe cheapest modern pillow is domed and made of polystyrene (styrofoam). It is often called a cookie pillow, because of its shape. Another modern pillow is a block pillow, with a frame which holds covered polystyrene blocks. The blocks can be moved around as the lace progresses, to keep the lace being worked on at the centre of the pillow.\\n\nLacemaking organizations\nLacemaking is considered a folk art with technique and materials varying widely across the globe. Most lacemakers belong to regional guilds within their country of origin. Guilds can be devoted to one kind of lace, often that which developed locally, or may include makers of all kinds. In the United States, most guilds are organized within chapters of the International Organization of Lace , which also includes Canadian lace guilds. Quarterly publications of \"The Bulletin\" journal provide articles about current projects and events, historical research, annual meeting details, patterns, and more. Internationally, the Organisation Internationale de la Dentelle au Fuseau et \\xc3 0 l\\'Aiguille (OIDFA, International Bobbin and Needle Lace Organization ) is the primary governing and networking body for lacemakers. OIDFA organizes annual global congresses, regional fairs, and local gatherings to promote the appreciation and knowledge of lacemaking.\\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nBolera Caribe\n\\n\nBolera Caribe is a bowling center located in barrio Coto Laurel in the municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico , where bowling competitions for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games (CACG) were held.   The venue is located at the intersection of PR-506 and PR-52 .  The Center is owned by Bolera Caribe, Inc. , a private company.  The bowling center was inaugurated in November 2004.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Bolera de Ponce , as Bolera Caribe was previously called, was inaugurated in Ponce in the mid 1950s in the Mariani sector of barrio Primero of Ponce. As the 1990s progressed, the neighborhood where the Bolera was located showed signs of aging and began to decay .  This was a problem for the company, as it was inconsistent with the image it wanted to portray and the type of clientele it was seeking to continue attracting.\\n\nDue to overcrowding in the area, parking also became a problem for the Bolera .  Thus, as overflow, guests made use of the parking area of a shopping plaza across the street from the Bolera. However, this resulted in several breakins that gave the Bolera a bad reputation as an entertainment destination. To solve the problem, the company attempted to sell the building and move elsewhere, but no buyer could be found. The business continued to lose revenue for several years. And a result the bowling alley opted for closing down while seeking another location. It closed down in the late 1990s, leaving the old building vacant.\\n\nNew building and location\nIn 2007, the company found a suitable location for its new bowling center at the intersection of routes PR-506 and PR-52, which provided easy access to Ponce and towns nearby, thus providing it greater exposure as well. Given its new location the Bolera shed its Ponce-only roots and became more of a regional entertainment venue.  In light of this, its name was also changed from Bolera de Ponce to Bolera Caribe , thus reflecting its newly expanded business territory. Caribe means Caribbean in Spanish. This name change was appropriate because not only the city of Ponce but all of its neighboring towns are on the shores of the Caribbean.  The new bowling center was part of Mayor Churumba \\'s plan for providing an entertainment venue in that part of the municipality.  The venue is currently the only bowling center in the entire Caribbean coast of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nBuilding\nThe new Bolera Caribe was designed by CMA Architects & Engineers LLP, the same Puerto Rican architectural firm that built the Center for Molecular and Comparative Medicine at the Ponce School of Medicine , the 16-story Torre Chardón office tower in San Juan\\'s Plaza Las Américas , and the underground Urban Train Río Piedras University Station. The building consists of 2500 square meters of space.  \\n\nFacilities\nThe facility includes:  \\n\nEconomics\nThe facility was built at a cost of USD $6 million.  Current estimates show this company has an annual revenue of $130,000 and employs a staff of approximately two employees.  The Bolera is the venue for the Ponce Bowling Club Bowling League, and other leagues.   \\n\nCentral American and Caribbean Games\nThe bowling center was the venue of bowling competitions for the 21st Central American and Caribbean Games .  The bowling venue is in regulatory compliance with the World Tenpin Bowling Association (WTBA) standards, which helped get it approved as \"the official stage for the upcoming bowling competitions of the XXI Central American and Caribbean Games to be held in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico in July 2010.\"  The Games were celebrated from July 17 to August 1, 2010, in the city of Mayagüez , and the schedule of events showed when Games were played at the Bolera .  The bowling center has a capacity of 300 Game  espectators.  The facilities were offered to the CACG Organizing Committee by the Mayor of Ponce , María Meléndez , in April 2010: \"The events of canoeing, rowing, and bowling will take place in the Ciudad Señorial , this last one at Bolera Caribe.\"  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°02\\xe2\\x80\\xb218.41\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°32\\xe2\\x80\\xb257.68\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.0384472°N 66.5493556°W ﻿ / 18.0384472; -66.5493556 \\n"

In 2000, its population was 4,963.  \\n\nHistory\nBoquerón was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Boquerón was 1,185.  \\n\nPeople from the El Combate community in barrio Boquerón are known as mata con hacha (\"those who kill with axes\") based on an old folk tale about a fight over the salinas , where those from Cabo Rojo fought with axes against people from the adjacent town of Lajas . The latter apparently fought back by throwing stones and are thus known as tira piedras (\"those who throw stones\").  \\n \\n\nFeatures\nThe barrio is home to a village ( El Poblado de Boquerón ) and two national wildlife refuges . The Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge is a habitat for a number of native bird species, including the endangered yellow-shouldered blackbird , also known as mariquita de Puerto Rico or capitán .

Throughout the years no one has found any treasure in the cave.  \\n\nThe downtown of Boquerón known as El Poblado is known for its gastronomy and its nightlife. It is home to many restaurants offering local, international, and fusion cuisine which feature the excellent seafood that Cabo Rojo is renowned for.  El Poblado is also populated by bars for every preference, from pool halls to holes-in-the-wall, many providing a variety of flavored mojitos and other mixed drinks. Outdoor karaoke is also a feature of Boquerón nightlife as cars are not permitted in the center of El Poblado during the weekends, so karaoke spills out into the streets.

        "page_content": "Contents\nBoquerón State Forest\nBoquerón State Forest  is one of the 20 forestry units that make up the public forest system of Puerto Rico . Despite its name, the Boquerón State Forest is not only located in Boquerón, Cabo Rojo but also spans almost 5,000 acres across the municipalities of Cabo Rojo , Lajas and Mayagüez .   The forest area is also known for its limestone cliffs, the lighthouse , and the salt flats which have been a source of salt since the pre-Hispanic era and, dating to 700 C.E., they are considered to be one of the oldest industries in the Americas .   \\n\nHistory\nBoquerón State Forest is one of the oldest forests in the Puerto Rico state forest system. It was proclaimed and designated a forest preserve in 1918 by Puerto Rico governor Arthur Yager with the purpose of preserving the mangrove biomes in Cabo Rojo and Lajas. Two additional segments, the Guayacán and Cuevas Keys, were added in 1943. The areas of the Molino mangroves, Los Morrillos (famous for its lighthouse ) and the Guaniquilla Lagoon and surrounding mangroves were annexed to the Boquerón State Forest in 1980.  \\n\nThe state forest today is managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources and extends across 9 management segments across three municipalities:   \\n\nThe 607-acre area designated since 1980 as the Cabo Rojo National Natural Landmark is also located within the state forest area.  \\n\nGeology\nThe forest is located in the Puerto Rico southern karst region and as such all of its geological formations contain limestone , particularly the Ponce limestone . It is often said that the reddish-colored limestone is what gives its name to the municipality and city of Cabo Rojo (Spanish for \"red cape\").  \\n\nEcology\nThe Boquerón Forest is ecologically important and it hosts several marine biomes in addition to the mangrove forests such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows which are important to threatened species such as the West Indian manatee .   \\n\nAll four species of mangrove are found within the forest, in addition to important indicator plant species such as the bullet tree ( Terminalia buceras ), the greenheart ( Colubrina arborenscens ) and the sea grape ( Coccoloba uvifera ). The endangered black cóbana ( Libidibia monosperma ) and the critically endangered bariaco ( Trichilia triacantha ) are also found and preserved in the forest.  \\n\nThe beaches around the forest are important sea turtle nesting sites, particularly for the leatherback sea turtle ( Dermochelys coriacea ), the hawksbill sea turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricada ) and the green sea turtle ( Chelonia mydas ). Additionally, the forest serves as one of the few habitats in the world where the endangered yellow-shouldered blackbird ( Yellow-shouldered blackbird ) can be found.   \\n\nRecreation\nThe forest\\'s main offices are located in Poblado de Boquerón , Cabo Rojo . Tours are available for large groups but must be reserved in anticipation by contacting the forest office at (787)-851-7260.  The reserve offers opportunities for hiking, fishing, kayaking, biking, snorkeling and birdwatching.  The area also contains numerous landmarks and tourist attractions such as the Los Morrillos Lighthouse , the salt flats, and the limestone cliffs and rock formations such as the Stone Bridge , and numerous beaches.    \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge\nCabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge  is an 1,836-acre National Wildlife Refuge located in southwestern Puerto Rico , in the municipality of Cabo Rojo . The refuge is a habitat for number of native bird species including the endangered yellow-shouldered blackbird , locally known as mariquita de Puerto Rico or capitán . Many birds find their way to the refuge while migrating between North and South America, and more than 118 bird species have been recorded near the area.\\n\nThe Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge is administered as part of the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife complex .  \\n\nHistory\nThe refuge was established in 1974, when 587 acres of land were obtained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from the Central Intelligence Agency which had operated the Caribbean Bureau of the Foreign Broadcast Information Service there for a number of years.  \\n\nIn 1999, the FWS purchased and added to the refuge the Cabo Rojo Salt Flats , a historic salt mining site located near the Los Morrillos Lighthouse . This site dates to 700 C.E. and is considered one of the oldest industries in the Americas.  Caborrojeños Pro Salud y Ambiente , a local civic group, runs a visitor center in the salt flats area.  \\n\nFeatures\nThe Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge was established to protect the rolling hills, grasslands, mangroves and subtropical dry forests of Cabo Rojo.  Due to decades of overgrazing , much of the native vegetation has been replaced by plants from other regions. Invasive species like the grasses that feed cattle are considered undesirable because they compete with the native vegetation, reducing diversity and therefore decreasing optimal food and nesting habitat for the native wildlife. Grassland management, through haying, has allowed native grasses to grow back and provide a better home for the native fauna. Additionally, native trees are being planted to return the land to its original mature hardwood forest.  \\n\nThe Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge has been designated a Critical Habitat for the yellow-shouldered blackbird ( Agelaius xanthomus ), and the Cabo Rojo Salt Flats are recognized as an Important Critical Wildlife site within the refuge. The refuge has also been declared a BirdLife International Important Bird Area (under the name Suroeste de Puerto Rico ) and was the first Caribbean site to be added to the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN).  \\n\nWildlife\nCabo Rojo National Refuge is home to 245 plant species and 145 bird species, including shore and land birds. Some of the bird species found in the refuge include the American kestrel ( Falco sparverius ), the smooth-billed ani ( Crotophaga ani ), the black-necked stilt ( Himantopus mexicanus ), the yellow or mangrove warbler ( Setophaga petechia ), the Adelaide\\'s warbler ( Setophaga adelaidae ), the troupial ( Icterus icterus ) which was introduced from Venezuela, the semipalmated plover ( Charadrius semipalmatus ), the Wilson\\'s plover ( Charadrius wilsonia ) and the Puerto Rican woodpecker ( Melanerpes portoricensis ).  \\n\nThe refuge is also home to a large number of endemic reptiles and amphibians such as the Puerto Rican red-eyed frog ( Eleutherodactylus antillensis ), the Cuban tree frog ( Osteopilus septentrionalis ) and the white-lipped frog ( Leptodactylus albilabris ).  Native plants found in the refuge include the cobana negra ( Stahlia monosperma ), the pipe-organ cactus ( Cephalocerus royenii ), the West Indian birch ( Bursera simaruba ) and the guayacan ( Guaiacum officinale ).  \\n\nAdjacent protected areas\nThe Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge is located close to the Laguna Cartagena National Wildlife Refuge , both of which are administered as part of the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife complex . The national wildlife refuge is also adjacent to different units belonging to the Boquerón State Forest , which protects the mangrove forests that stretch from Cabo Rojo to Lajas , and the Cabo Rojo National Natural Landmark .  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n\nThis article related to a protected area in the United States is a stub .

The company\\'s headquarters are located at Avenida Las Americas/ Route 163 and Calle Comercio/ Route 133 in Barrio San Antón in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico . The company used to be called Cooperativa de Cafeteros (Coffee-growers Cooperative).\\n\nIts coffee has been reported to be Puerto Rico\\'s best and its San Carlos Selection is said to have been the Vatican \\'s favorite coffee at one time.    The company has the only coffee tasting lab and the only Certified Taster on the Island.   The company has a partnership with Yauco Selecto Estate Coffee.  \\n\nHistory\nCooperativa de Cafeteros was founded on 11 June 1924.  Its first administrator was Ramiro L. Colon . It was the first agricultural cooperative union in Puerto Rico.  One of its major goals, when it was founded, was to become a major player in the coffee business by being not just the major grower of Puerto Rican coffee, but also its major manufacturer.\\n\nIn September 2009, the company closed the 110,000 square feet (10,000 m 2 ) Avenida Las Americas plant for renovations and Puerto Rico Coffee Roasters spent $8 million to reopen it again in December 2010. Today, the Las Americas plant performs some 60% of the company\\'s coffee roasting operations there.    \\n\nIn July 2008, Puerto Rico Coffee Roaster purchased the Café Rico , Café Yaucono , and Café Rioja brands, thus acquiring about 60 percent of Puerto Rico\\'s coffee market.   \\n\nToday\nToday, Cafe Rico is the coffee with the highest sales in Puerto Rico.

Cafe Rico stopped operations out of its Las Americas Avenue plant in Ponce in September 2008 but, in August 2010, Puerto Rico Coffee Roaster announced plans to invest US$8 million to bring the plant back into operation. With the investment, its Santurce operations will move to Ponce. This will make the Las Americas location \"the largest coffee roasting location in the Caribbean\"  and the facility \"the most modern coffee roasting facility in the Caribbean.\"   Some of the products of the company are Decaff, Cafe Rico, 50/50, Yauco Selecto, and Yaucono Espresso.  \\n\nSales volume\nDuring fiscal year 1962-63, the total volume of the cooperative was $35 million.\\n\nHeadquarters and warehouses\nThe central offices are in the city of Ponce. There are also branch offices in San Juan, Arecibo, Yauco, Mayaguez, San Sebastián, Utuado, Adjuntas, Jayuya, and Ciales.\\n\nFederal relations\nIn the 1930s, the company had over $300,000 in escrow at the bank of Baltimore. It is an agricultural partner with the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank. It is a member of Federacion de Cooperativas de Estados Unidos, United Cooperatives, the Cooperative Grange League Federation , and the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, the National Council for Farmer Cooperatives, and the American Institute for Cooperation.\\n\nEconomic outlook\nThe company has $10 million in resources, with reserves of $4 million.

        "page_content": "Contents\nCaguana Ceremonial Ball Courts Site\nThe Caguana Ceremonial Ball Courts Site (often referred to as Caguana Site ) is an archaeological site located in Caguana, Utuado in Puerto Rico , considered to be one of the largest and most important Pre-Columbian sites in the West Indies .  The site is known for its well-preserved ceremonial ball courts and petroglyph -carved monoliths. Studies estimate the in-situ courts to be over 700 years old, built by the Taíno around 1270 AD.   \\n\nOverview\nApproximately 13 ball courts and plazas ( bateyes ) have been identified and many have been restored to their original state. Monoliths and petroglyphs carved by the Taínos can be seen among the rocks and stones, some weighing over a ton, that were most likely brought from the Tanama River located adjacent to the site.  \\n\nThe site also contains the largest concentration of petroglyphs in the Antilles,  most of which around found carved into the stone monoliths that form the bateyes or ball courts. Some of the most famous pictographs include a heron-like bird and atabeyra , also known as the \"Caguana woman\",  attributed to the fertility zemi or goddess Atabey .  \\n\nThe plan of the site and the positions of the ball courts indicate an alignment with specific astronomical events, and the site might have functioned as a place to observe and possibly predict astronomical events such as planetary and stellar transits, conjunctions and alignments. Numerous of the petroglyphs depict astronomical objects such as the moon, stars and planets. Although the site is not listed as a world heritage site , its archaeoastronomical features are well-documented and recognized by the UNESCO Astronomy and World Heritage Initiative.   \\n\nHistory\nThe site of the modern archaeological site was originally known as Corrales de los Indios (Spanish for \"Indian corrals\") by locals after the corral-like outlines of some of the ball courts. The first exploration and survey-works in the site were led by American anthropologist John Alden Mason in 1914. The site has been under continuous study since the 1930s, at first by archaeologists from Yale University such as Irvin Rouse , and later by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (ICP) and Dr. Ricardo Alegría . The ICP acquired the site in 1965 and invested in the restoration of its archaeological resources and on interpretative infrastructure for visitors.  The interpretative park and a small museum were first opened to visitors that same year.  \\n\nThe museum remained closed from 2020 until june of 2024 when it reopened with a more thorough collection of more than 200 archaeological pieces.   A digital version of the museum titled Museo Digital de Caguana was launched in 2024 by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture.  \\n\nDesignations\nThe Institute of Puerto Rican Culture still manages the site as a park under the name Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Center ( Parque Ceremonial Indígena de Caguana ). The National Park Service has placed it on the National Register of Historic Places , and designated it as a National Historic Landmark (under the name Caguana Site ). It was listed on the National Register in 1992 and designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1993.    It was also listed on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2001.  \\n\nThe park also includes a small museum containing Taíno artifacts , archaeological exhibits and a small botanical garden featuring some of the plants the Taínos harvested for food such as sweet potatoes , cassava , corn , and yautía . Many of the trees used by the Taínos to construct their homes ( bohíos ), such as mahogany and ceiba can also be seen throughout the park.  \\n\nGallery\nScenes at Caguana Ceremonial Ball Courts Site:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCaguas barrio-pueblo\nCaguas Pueblo is a barrio and downtown area that serves the administrative center ( seat ) of the city and municipality of Caguas , a municipality of Puerto Rico. It is bordered by the Cagüitas River to the north and located two miles southwest of the Río Grande de Loíza . Its population in 2020 was 19,020.     \\n\nAs was customary in Spain , in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo ( barrio-pueblo starting with the 1990 US Census) which contains a central plaza or main town square, the municipal buildings (such as the city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the main town square every year.   The municipal and mayoral offices were located in the City Hall building at the western edge of the main town square until 2010 when a new City Hall building located in the northwestern side of the downtown area was inaugurated.\\n\nThe historic downtown district ( pueblo ) of Caguas was listed on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones ( Registro Nacional de Sitios y Zonas Históricas ) on July 6, 1996, under the name Zona Histórica de Caguas .  \\n\nGeography\nCaguas Pueblo , officially designated as Caguas Barrio-pueblo and popularly referred to as Downtown Caguas in English, is located in the middle plains of the Caguas Valley . It is bordered by the Cagüitas River to the north, the Loíza River to the east and the Turabo River to the south.  \\n\nHistory\nThe area where downtown Caguas is located today was originally inhabited by the Taíno people. This area of the valley was ideal for the cultivation of crops, such as cassava , due to the fertile river-fed soil. At the time of the Spanish colonization the local tribes were led by the cacique Caguax , from whom the Spanish settlement of San Sebastián del Piñal de Caguax got its name. This village was granted town privileges in 1812 and its first city hall was built in 1820 when it received the title of Villa y cabeza de distrito de Provincia de España (\" Villa and District headquarters of a Spanish province\"). The village was finally granted full city rights in 1894.  \\n\nCaguas barrio-pueblo was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Caguas Pueblo was 5,450.  The area was heavily damaged by San Felipe Segundo (also known as the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane ) in 1928 and many historical buildings were demolished then, which is why many of the older buildings, such as the cathedral, date from the 1930s after many rebuilding projects in the downtown took place.  \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nThe main town square of Caguas is named Plaza de Recreo Santiago R. Palmer . This is one of the largest main town squares or plazas in Puerto Rico. The central plaza or square, is a public space that is often used for official and unofficial recreational events and is a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nLocated across from the central plaza in Caguas barrio-pueblo is the Catedral Dulce Nombre de Jesús which serves as the regional Catholic cathedral. A hermitage was built in 1626 and by 1775 it had been renamed to its current name. In 1830 the construction of a church made of masonry began. The church was used until 1928 when it was damaged by San Felipe Segundo hurricane . Having sustained too much damage, it was demolished and reconstructed starting in 1936 based on an architectural design by Pedro Méndez and Joseph O\\'Kelly. The church was restored in 1999. In 1964 the church became a cathedral.  \\n\nLandmarks and places of interest\nGallery\nPlaces in Caguas barrio-pueblo:\\n\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCaguas Valley\nThe Caguas Valley , or the Caguas-Juncos Valley ,  and popularly referred to as the Turabo Valley ( Valle del Turabo ), is a large valley lying between two mountain subranges of the Cordillera Central , Sierra de Cayey and Sierra de Luquillo , in the eastern region of the main island of Puerto Rico .  From west to east, the valley is concentrated in the municipalities of Caguas , Gurabo , San Lorenzo , Juncos , Las Piedras , and Humacao . \\n\nGeography\nIn a clockwise direction, the valley is bound by the Altos de La Mesa and Altos de San Luis mountain ridges to the north, the Sierra de Luquillo in the northeast, the San Lorenzo Batholith in the east and southeast, the Sierra de Cayey in the south, and the foothills of the Cordillera Central in the west.  \\n\nThis valley is fed mainly by the Río Grande de Loíza , the largest hydrological basin in Puerto Rico, and numerous tributaries such as the Cagüitas , along which the contemporary settlement of Caguas was built. The name Valle del Turabo (\"Turabo Valley\") comes from the Turabo River , which is another tributary that flows from the south. The Gurabo River , another major tributary, feeds into the Grande de Loíza at a region where the valley narrows into a rift valley , often called the Gurabo Valley, that runs from west to east and ends in Las Piedras and Humacao in the southeastern coast of the island.  \\n\nGeology\nThe Caguas Valley, from Caguas to Juncos , is formed by Holocene alluvial deposits that lay on top of hardened rock of volcanic origin, lava , and intrusive and metamorphic rocks that date from the Late Cretaceous to the Tertiary period. There are also small deposits of limestone. Except for the alluvium zone, the rocks in the basin do not generate large aquifers due to their low permeability . The alluvium in the valley includes non-uniform mixtures of sand , gravel , silt and mud , varying in thickness from 0 feet in with consolidated rocks to 160 feet in Caguas and Gurabo. In the area towards Gurabo and Juncos the alluvium contains more sand and gravel than in the area of Caguas; these alluvial deposits form the main aquifer in the area. The flows of the Loíza River and its tributaries, mainly the Gurabo River, have eroded most alluvial deposits within the fluvial flood zones.   \\n\nClimate\nThe climate of the Caguas-Juncos Valley is rainy, with areas receiving up to 100 inches of precipitation annually. Rain varies throughout the year with the dry period lasting from January to April, the rainiest period being from May to June, the driest period from July to August, and the period of heavy rains lasting until the end of the year.  \\n\nLa India Dormida\nLa India Dormida (Spanish for \"the sleeping Indian [woman]\") is a famous geographical landmark for locals in the Valley of Caguas. Although often called a mountain, this is actually a group of mountains that through forced perspective (when seen from the north) form the shape of a sleeping woman. According to legend, the Taíno cacique Caguax had a niece called Taina (or Tayana ) who sacrificed herself and was turned into the mountain during the Spanish conquest of Borinquen (or Boriken , the native name for Puerto Rico). The best way to observe this optical illusion is from Altos de San Luis, Altos de La Mesa and on expressway PR-52 and highway PR-1 when driving from north to south through the valley.  \\n\nSettlements and barrios\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCaja de Muertos Island\n\\n\nCaja de Muertos ( lit. \\' Chest of the Dead \\' ;    also in English: Deadman\\'s Chest or Coffin Island ) is an uninhabited island off the southern coast of Puerto Rico , in the municipality of Ponce . The island and its surrounding waters are protected by the Caja de Muertos Nature Reserve , because of its native turtle traffic and ecological value of its dry forests and reefs. Hikers and beachgoers are often seen in the island, which can be reached by ferry from the La Guancha Boardwalk sector of Ponce Playa . Together with Cardona , Ratones , Morrillito , Isla del Frio , Gatas , and Isla de Jueyes , Caja de Muertos is one of seven islands ascribed to the municipality of Ponce .   \\n\nHistory\nIt is believed the island is only some 4,000 years old, and stone art left on the island attests it has been visited by man over milennnia.  Taíno natives made frequent trips to the island on fishing expeditions, and when they were defeated by the Spanish during the 1511 battle of Spanish-Taíno War for Borikén , the natives attempted a retreat to the Caja de Muertos but shortly afterwards they were either captured or killed.  During much of the 17th century, the island is known to have been used as a hideout by pirates and mutineers. For example, in 1599-1600 it was used by a group merchants-turned-pirates who, after learning of a Portuguese ship filled with gold, silver, precious stones, other treasures, attacked it and appropriated its contents. As they attempted to travel back to England, though, they faced an attempted mutiny and, surviving it, they took refuge at Caja de Muertos. Venturing to the Puerto Rico mainland for provisions, they were killed, except for one, who later confessed to the existence of the hidden treasure. The Spanish colonial governor then appropriated the remaining treasure for construction projects among other uses.  \\n\nIn 1842, the first known map was drafted using the name of the island as it is known today.  In 1880 the Spanish government started construction of a lighthouse on the island, completing it in 1887.   During the 19th century, the island was also hideout for Puerto Rican patriots who sought independence from Spain. Some of the patriots who hid there include Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis .  During these decades it was the secret meeting places of masons when they were persecuted on the mainland.   In 1928, Cayetano Coll y Toste wrote a novel titled \"El Tesoro del Pirata Almeida\" (The Treasure of Pirate Almeida) inspired by Caja de Muertos island, and in 1883, it inspired Robert Louis Stevenson to write the novel \"Treasure Island\".   \\n\nIn 1898, at the time of the American invasion , the island had a population of 64 permanent residents, and a decade later only 16 residents remained.  These residents had no fresh water in the island, so water was brought in from the mainland when, during periods of little rain, it could not be collected from the rainfall.  The island eventually became uninhabited, except for the lightkeepers. In 1945 when the island\\'s lighthouse was automated,  there was no longer a need to have lighthouse keepers and the island became deserted.  After this, the island became a day-trip vacationing spot for some owners of private vessels who might venture to the island for a day trip or for fishing.\\n\nOn January 2, 1980  the island was declared a nature reserve by act of the Puerto Rico Legislature and entrusted to the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources to be guarded and administered. It is administered in conjunction of the Ponce Municipal Government.  In 1985, the Government of Puerto Rico gave its approval for the development of a tourism center at Caja de Muertos.  The lighthouse was restored by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources and for a while it housed a museum.   The Puerto Rico Ports Authority had public transportation to the Island until 1993; shortly thereafter a company called \"Island Venture\" started offering daily trips.  Service was interrupted twice, after Hurricane Maria and after the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes , both of which badly damaged La Guancha , the area on the mainland where passengers boarded the catamarans to the island. The Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources built a dock, barracks for reserve personnel, as well as a small museum, trail signs, and compost bathrooms for tourists.\\n\nIn 2009, the government of Puerto Rico announced plans to make development of the island and its restoration of its lighthouse, both for tourism purposes, a priority of the DRNA.   By the summer of 2012, there were three businesses making tour trips there, including one for charter trips only.  In 2010, Playa Pelícano received the Blue Flag beach certification.  In 2017, much of what DRNA had built was destroyed by Hurricane Maria and the tourist ferry was halted, but restarted about a year later.   \\n\nHowever, government inaction following the 2019-20 Puerto Rico earthquakes left the reserve without DRNA rangers for over a year, since the housing structure was severely damaged and not timely repaired or replaced and they limited to maritime patrolling despite having obsolete equipment and expired bulletproof vests.  In 2021, the last of three vehicles assigned for this task broke down and the rounds stopped altogether. This had several repercussions on the natural reserve, leading to tourists illegally breaching the perimeter, anchoring in the sand, riding jet skis, camping, hosting parties and vandalizing the remains of the fallen structure.  The preservation program that monitors and protect the reproduction habitat of the hawksbill sea turtle was halted, due to the rangers being unable to follow up on their nesting habits, leaving 25 stations unattended.  \\n\nWhen queried about the situation in April 2022, the DRNA claimed that the housing structure would be eventually reconstruct since disaster mitigation funds had been approved for that purpose.  However, the process was still in the early stage, since the government had yet to name a contractor for the project. The agency also claimed that patrolling had taken place when the boat \"was available\".  \\n\nLocation\nCaja de Muertos is located 5.2 mi (8.4 km) south of the Puerto Rican mainland and is part of the Playa   barrio of Ponce , Puerto Rico, municipality .\\n\nGeography and climate\nThe island measures 2 mi (3 km) long northeast-southwest, and up to 2,822 ft (860 m) wide [1,837 ft (560 m) on the average]. It has an area of 0.59 sq mi (1.53 km 2 ). Close by are Morrillito Key [591 ft (180 m) off the southwest point, 0.02 sq mi (0.05 km 2 )] and Berbería Key [3.9 mi (6.3 km) to the northeast, 0.12 sq mi (0.31 km 2 )], both part of the Caja de Muertos Natural Reserve . Berbería Key belongs to Rio Canas Abajo barrio of Juana Díaz municipality .\\n\nThe climate is dry and the island supports dry forest . A still-functioning lighthouse , Caja de Muertos Light , established in 1887 and automated in 1945, sits atop the highest hill on the island. This 170 foot high hill is located at the southwest extreme of the island.  \\n\nFeatures\nThe island has four beaches: Pelicano, Playa Larga, Carrucho, and Coast Guard. The island also possesses fauna and flora not found anywhere else in the world.  The island has no permanent residents, but the Government of Puerto Rico maintains Department of Natural Resources staff and security personnel there. In 1899, it registered a permanent population of 64 residents, but it since declined to zero.  \\n\nEtymology\nSince 1511, the island has been called by different names including Isla Abeiranas, Abairianay, Antías, Jutías, Yautías, Utías, Abeianay, Angulo, Isla Bestia, and Isla del Tesoro, in addition to the translations as Coffre A'morr , Deadman's Chest , and Coffin Island .  Caja de Muertos can be translated into English as \"Coffin\" or \"Dead Man\\'s Chest\", there is no consensus on how the island got its current name. The official version of the origin of the name, as given by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources, and under whose care the island is currently entrusted, is as follows: \"Its name is attributed to the 18th-century French writer Jean-Baptiste Labat who called it Coffre \\xc3 0 mort (Caja de Muertos) or Bomba d\\'Infierno , making reference to the fact that when the island is seen from certain places in southern Puerto Rico, it gives the impression of seeing a dead person laying on a plateau.\"  \\n\nIn 1901, it was suggested by one A. W. Van Buren of Yale University that the island\\'s name may be related to the sea shanty \" Dead Man\\'s Chest \", first written by Robert Louis Stevenson for his novel Treasure Island ;  However, no scholar since Van Buren has made this connection nor is there any evidence to support such a claim. Further, Van Buren says that Stevenson did not write the song \" Dead man\\'s chest \" himself, that he \"picked it up somewhere\", which is another baseless claim (see \" Dead Man\\'s Chest \" for more information on the fakelore surrounding this song).  Finally, the shanty invented by Stevenson was most likely inspired by a different island, Dead Chest Island, British Virgin Islands .    \\n\nOne story given by Kurt Pitzer and Tara Stevens is that of a Portuguese pirate, José Almeida.  A former merchant sailor, Almeida fell in love with a Basque woman in Cura\\xc3 7ao , married her in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands and took her pirating with him around the Caribbean. On the first raid, she was killed by a stray bullet. Distraught, Almeida had her embalmed and placed in a glass box inside a copper coffin. He buried her in a cave in a deserted island near Ponce.  He would come every month to gaze over her preserved body and leave half of his treasure in her grave. Almeida, however, was caught in the Puerto Rico mainland, tried, and executed in Castillo San Felipe del Morro in 1832. Many years later, a Spanish engineer discovered the glass and copper coffin, and identifying the cay on a map gave it its present name.  The treasure found, if any, was kept secret.  \\n\nIn 1599, several English merchants departed to China with a letter from Queen Elizabeth to the Chinese government.  However, the expedition was dangerous and a ship was lost to the weather.  Off the Indian coast the group turned to piracy and after learning of a Portuguese ship filled with gold, silver, precious stones, other treasures and other valuables (spices, silk, some clothing), they attacked and captured the vessel.  The fleet managed to capture another vessel, but in the process lost its flagship and a large part of the crew was fatally injured, including the fleet commander.  Shorthanded, the group decided to return to England aboard a smaller ship, taking part of the loot with them.  After surviving an attempted mutiny, the Englishmen decided to take a canoe left behind by a frigate off Puerto Rico\\'s eastern coast from where they took refuge at Caja de Muertos.  Losing the smaller vessel, the Englishmen traveled to the main island in search of provisions, but one of them left behind to mind the canoe was captured and let the presence of the treasure known to the local authorities.  \\n\nThis led to an incursion to take the treasure, where all but one of the Englishmen were suddenly executed despite negotiations and the Spanish took the treasure with them and reported it as being captured in a battle with the English.  The lone survivor, named Thomas, managed to build a makeshift boat out of wood remnants and drifted to Puerto Rico, being taken to San Germán and telling his version of the events.  The governor of Puerto Rico grew suspicious and an investigation was held between the autumn of 1599 and early 1600, which lead to a confession by one of the murderers.  The authorities then began confiscating the treasure seized during the incursion, with other parts disappearing and reportedly ending in the hands of the governor\\'s own nephew.  The treasure confiscated was auctioned, with about 4,000 ducats of Indian silver remaining by 1602.  The following governor employed another part in construction, with a collection of jewels and bars that were left behind being sold.  The last piece, a large gemstone, was sent abroad for transport to Spain.  From these events, the island would gain the moniker of \"Isla de Caja de Muertos\" (\"Dead Man's Chest\").  \\n\nNatural reserve\nThe island was designated as a nature reserve in 1980 after a meeting was held in Puerto Rico by the Puerto Rico Planning Board wherein they considered the recommendation set forth by the Coastal Management Zone Program to turn the island into a protected wilderness area. The island has remained a protected area ever since.  The protection is mainly due to its heavy turtle traffic which is an endangered species .\\n\nBeaches\nThe island is home to five beaches: Playa Pelícano, Playa Ensenadita (\"Pocitas\"), Playa Larga, Playa Blanca (also called Playa Coast Guard), and Playa Chica.  Playa Pelícano has been named a blue flag beach.   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nCitations \\n\nBibliography \\n\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCalle 25 de Enero\n\\n\nCalle 25 de Enero (lit., 25 January Street) is a street and historic Victorian block located in barrio Segundo  in Ponce, Puerto Rico , built to house Ponce\\'s volunteer firemen and their families,  after the historic fire that took place in the city on 25 January 1899,  in appreciation for their labor on that fateful day.  \\n\nThis picturesque street is lined with 39 red-striped and black-striped houses,   the local firefighters' colors. The street takes its name from the historic fire that took place in the town on that day in 1899.  Since then, and for a number of years, the city of Ponce built new homes on this street and then drew lots to see which of its firemen would be the lucky owners of these free new properties.  \\n\nHistory\nAs a result of the devastating fires that have regularly swept through the city, firefighters are a particularly revered group in Ponce.  But it was the fire on 25 January 1899, known as El Polvorín , that is perhaps the most famous. It started in a military munition depot, located just three blocks from the now also historic Parque de Bombas firehouse , yet the firefighters were told not to fight the fire.  The reason for the order is not really known but what is certain is that several firemen decided to disobey orders, extinguishing the fire and saving the town.  Although they were initially in danger of being punished for insubordination , the people of Ponce considered them heroes and there was an enormous public outcry when they were jailed for disobedience. Eventually, the U.S. military government in Ponce rethought its decision, freed the men and the city honored them in a public celebration.  \\n\nFor years the city wanted to do something more than just recognize and honor the firefighters\\' wisdom and courage . So seven years later, and starting on 30 May 1906,  the City put together a system whereby these firefighters and their families would be provided with free housing.  \\n\nThe firefighters of the city had always been volunteers and the municipal government decided to recognize their courage and importance by selecting a firefighter each year to receive a new home. These houses were constructed by the government and the official name of the street where they were built was eventually changed to 25 de Enero Street, \"the 25th of January Street\", in honor of those firefighters who saved the city in 1899. The houses, which today number about 60, are easily spotted. They are painted in the distinctive red and black colors of Ponce.  \\n\nToday\nThe houses, the street and its surrounding areas were restored in 1991 under mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago as part of the city\\'s efforts to \"rescue\" its history.  \\n\nStarting in the early twentieth century, the site of the El Polvorin fire saw the construction of what became Ponce High School .  The school, still functioning today, is a complex of seven buildings and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places .\\n\nPonce is the only town in Puerto Rico that has officially declared a group of citizens as \"heroes\". The date of the twenty-fifth of January is, after the date of the founding of the city (1692), the second most important date in the municipality of Ponce.  The seven heroes where: Rafael Rivera Esbri (who later became mayor of the municipality), Juan Romero, Rafael del Valle y Valle, Cayetano Casals, Pedro Sabater, Gregorio Rivera, Pedro Ruiz y Tomás Rivera.  The heroes proclamation was made via a legislative action and was exhibited at the Parque de Bombas museum. Regrettably, it disappeared from the museum while it was being restored during the years 1969 to 1972.  \\n\nIn gratitude for their work, every January 25 the municipality of Ponce places a wreath of flowers and performs other activities to commemorate the daring labor of these heroes during the fateful \"El Polvorin\" fire.  The city also has a marble obelisk prominently displayed on its main square, Plaza Federico Degetau , to honor the memory of the heroes of \"El Polvorin\". The obelisk was erected by a city board consisting of Jaime L. Drew , Antonio Arias , and Antonio Mirabal .  It was built in 1958, thus replacing the original obelisk built shortly after the 25 January 1899 fire which was destroyed by the 1918 Puerto Rico earthquake .  Ponce firefighters have another memorial at Cementerio Civil de Ponce : the Monument to the El Polvorin Heroes , where the remains of the seven heroes are buried. Ponce firefighters since those first seven heroes have been eligible to be laid to rest at this tomb-monument, and many have been laid there.\\n\nIn popular culture\nA composition by Banda Municipal de Ponce director Rubén Colón Tarrats was made about this street.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

The Cambalache State Forest is located in the municipalities of Arecibo and Barceloneta in northern Puerto Rico.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Cambalache State Forest was proclaimed in 1943 through a deal between the United States Forest Service and the Land Authority of Puerto Rico ( Autoridad de Tierras ) as part of a research program dedicated to the ecological and geological study of the island\\'s Northern karst . The forest was first known as the Cambalache Experimental Forest. It was proclaimed a state forest in 1973.  \\n\nDescription\nThe forest reserve protects steep limestone hills known as mogotes , which are covered in patches of moist forests . The elevation ranges from 5 to 50 m (16 to 164 ft) above mean sea level. Average rainfall is 1,479.8 mm (58.26 in) per year, with the temperature varying from 23.3 to 27 °C (73.9 to 80.6 °F). Mogotes oriented northeast to southeast have humid northern and southwestern slopes but xeric tops.  It has an area of 1,050 cuerdas (about 1,019 acres).  \\n\nThe forest is divided into various forest units located throughout the municipalities of Arecibo ( Factor , Garrochales , Miraflores , Sabana Hoyos and La Mano Farm) and Barceloneta (Benero and Palenque Farms).  \\n\nEcology and conservation\nMore than 150 trees and large shrubs have been identified in the forest. Common trees include Cecropia , Schefflera , and Tabebuia heterophylla . The endemic Puerto Rican royal palm ( Roystonea borinquena ) and Palma de Sierra ( Gaussia attenuata ) are also found in the forest. Zanthoxylum martinicense inhabits xeric areas.  Eugenia biflora and Eugenia ligustrina are found in the forest.  The hillsides and valleys are home to distinct vegetation zones. The valleys have lost most of their original vegetation and instead feature scrubby secondary forests and planted teak groves.  \\n\nThe forest is home to at least two endangered species: the Puerto Rican boa ( Epicrates inornatus ) and the red fruit bat ( Stenoderma rufum ). Some other animals found in the forest are the Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo ( Coccyzus vieilloti ), the Puerto Rican tody ( Todus mexicanus ), the green mango ( Anthracothorax viridis ), the Puerto Rican bullfinch ( Melopyrrha portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican oriole ( Icterus portoricensis ), and Adelaide\\'s warbler ( Setophaga adelaidae ). There is also a large variety of butterfly species some of which are rare.  \\n\nRecreation\nParts of the forest are open to visitors with opportunities for hiking, camping and biking. The visitors\\' area is located by highway PR-22 .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading"

This training facility was named posthumously after Medal of Honor recipient and native of Salinas, Puerto Rico, Specialist Four Héctor Santiago-Colón .\\n\nHistory\nIn 1940, the Federal government of the United States leased this military camp, then known as Camp Salinas, from the Government of Puerto Rico. In 1967, the U.S. Government licensed the camp to the Puerto Rico National Guard. Since that time the camp has grown from a tent city with very few permanent facilities to an installation of more than 300 buildings of approximately 66,489 square metres (715,680 sq ft).\\n\nIn 1941 the 65th Infantry Regiment 3rd Battalion was the first combat unit to train at this Southern Puerto Rico military camp before being sent to Panama to protect the Panama Canal during World War II .\\n\nIn 1966 Col. Alberto A. Nido requested the construction of a range, the National Guard Bureau approved the construction at the cost of $10,000. Captain Gabriel I. Peñagarícano was assigned project officer and the U.S. Army Antilles Command caretakers of the camp, provided earth-moving equipment and personnel. In 1974, Campamento Santiago\\'s air strip was renamed after administrative official Manuel Collazo.  \\n\nThe camp was named after Fourth Class Specialist Héctor Santiago Colón from Salinas, Puerto Rico, a posthumous Medal of Honor recipient.  The soldier died at the Quang Tri Province , South Vietnam on June 28, 1968, while serving for 1st Cavalry Division , 7th Cavalry , Company B, 5th Battalion, and became famous for trying to shield his comrades from a grenade with his own body.  The installation used for training of the Puerto Rico National Guard was formally named \"Campamento Santiago\" pursuant to an order issued by the General Quarters of the United States Army on July 1, 1975.  This marked the second instance that a military installation in Puerto Rico was renamed after a local soldier after Campamento García in Vieques was named after Fernando García.  Major General Carlos Chardón was actively involved in the process to propose the recognition.  The Cal. 45 shooting range at Campanento Santiago was named after Col.

Terry , is the oldest continuously functioning athletic field and baseball park in Puerto Rico , and the second oldest in the Caribbean .  The field is located in the city of Ponce and has a capacity of several thousand spectators. It is located next to the Francisco Pancho Coimbre Sports Museum .\\n\nHistory\nThe Campo Atlético Charles H. Terry was built in 1909 by initiative of then Ponce High School students Cayetano Pou, Rafael Matienzo and Francisco Perez, and the financial backing of Lucas P. Valdivieso and Fernando Luis Toro. The field was initially called La Liga del Castillo for its proximity to the Carcel del Castillo (Castillo Jail) then located just north of it, where Escuela de Bellas Artes de Ponce is located today (2019).  \\n\nThe Charles H. Terry Athletic Field opened in November 1910, in barrio Quinto , in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Its original intended use was to serve as an athletics, sports, and baseball field for students of the new Ponce High School . It was named after one of the first principals of the school, the continental Charles H. Terry, for his effort and dedication in securing the field for use by the students of his school.  \\n\nPrior to being used as an athletic field for school activities, the area was used for military exercises by the Spanish Military Headquarters adjacent to it.  The first official baseball game in Ponce took place in this field in 1899.  The first baseball championship in Ponce took place here in 1904 between the local Ponce, Pabst, and Atenas teams.  \\n\nThe American teacher Charles H. Terry, who in 1909 was named superintendent of Ponce public schools, made the arrangements with the United States Army stationed at the old Spanish Military headquarters adjacent to the field to acquire the area where the athletic field would be built. The building of the physical facilities started the same year. Engineers from the Central Guanica sugarcane mill lend technical assistance for the development of the facility. Adrian J. Grief, an officer at Central Guánica , donated the materials for the construction of the field. Volleyball, football , and basketball facilities were operational by 1913.  \\n\nIn 1913-1914 the American \"All Stars\" baseball team arrived in Ponce and played at Campo Atletico . The teams included players from the Major League Baseball as well as AAA baseball .  The 1920s saw the field being used mostly for track and field, basketball and baseball activities.\\n\nOn 27 February 1930 the daily Aguila de Puerto Rico announces a ceremony to name the field, which so far was called the local playground and Liga del Castillo, as Campo Atletico Charles H. Terry . In 1938 the semi-professional league is created in Puerto Rico and it starts sharing use of Campo Atletico with the professional league.  \\n3 December 1944, registered the first\\xe2\\x80\\x94and only\\xe2\\x80\\x94no hits-no-runs games in Puerto Rican professional baseball.  The last game in professional baseball played in Campo Atletico took place on 11 February 1949. After this date games were played at Estadio Francisco Montaner . Likewise, in that year basketball games were moved from the courts at Colegio Ponceño de Varones to the court at Charles H. Terry.  \\n\nIn the 1950s, Campo Atletico is rebuilt considerably. In 1983 the field is converted into Ciudad Deportiva Charles H. Terry. On 21 May 1992, the area beneath the grand stand is converted into a city sports museum, Museo Francisco \"Pancho\" Coimbre .  \\n\n100th anniversary\nThe celebrations commemorating the 100th anniversary of the park took place on 20 November 2010 at the Francisco \"Pancho\" Coimbre Sports Museum .  The museum is adjacent to the park. As part of the celebrations there was an exposition of photos and sports paraphernalia related to the historic park. There was also a 3-D model of the park produced by the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico School of Architecture . A documentary film was also incorporated. Participants included players, sports personalities and historians who have witnessed to the historical moments of the park.

        "page_content": "Contents\nCaparra Archaeological Site\nCaparra is an archaeological site in the municipality of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico .  It was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1994.  The site contains the remains of the first Spanish capital of the island, settled in 1508 and officially abandoned in 1521.  It represents the oldest known European settlement on United States territory.  \\n\nThe site is on the grounds of the Museum of the Conquest and Colonization of Puerto Rico (Museo de la Conquista y Colonización), which features artifacts from the site and other archaeological sites in Puerto Rico.\\n\nHistory\nIn 1508, Juan Ponce de León founded the original Spanish settlement in Puerto Rico at Caparra, named after the abandoned ancient Roman village of Cáparra in the province of Cáceres , Spain, the birthplace of then-governor of Spain\\'s Caribbean territories Nicolás de Ovando .,  Today it is known as the Pueblo Viejo barrio of Guaynabo , just to the west of the present San Juan metropolitan area.  \\n\nThe air was not wholesome and the mendicant friars insisted on moving the settlement closer to the bay and to the sea. They complained that the infants were dying. Their preferred area was that of the Islet of Puerto Rico (\"rich port\" or \"good port\"), because of its similar geographical features to the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands .  \\n\nIt was not until the end of Ponce de León\\'s tenure as governor that they had their wish. By 1521, the move was complete and it was known as \"Villa de Puerto Rico.\" With time the name of the island, San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico , traded places with what is now the capital of Puerto Rico: San Juan .  \\n\nAccording to Floyd, \"Ponce built the only stone house in the village, which for years functioned additionally as the Casa de Contratación , the archive, and the arsenal.\"  It became his permanent home, where he was joined by his family in 1509.  \\n\nArchaeological history\nThe Caparra Site was first identified as important during a survey in 1936, as part of a program to develop tourist facilities on the island.  Preliminary excavations spearheaded by Puerto Rico\\'s fifth official historian, Adolfo de Hostos ,  in 1936 and 1937, identified a large tapia structure, bisected by a two-lane highway, that matched de León\\'s description of his own residence, the only non-wooden structure in the settlement.  Further excavation identified the main plaza and the sites of other buildings.  \\n\nThe property was acquired by the Puerto Rican government in 1948, which relocated the northern section of the house ruins in order to widen the road.  The roadway was again widened in 1963, destroying the southern portion of the structure excavated in 1936.  The museum was established in 1958; the site continues to be examined by archaeologists.  \\n\nIn folklore\nA story from 1530 says that two Spanish men, Diego Ramos de Orozco and Diego Guilarte de Salazar, were living in Caparra and searching for gold in Puerto Rico\\'s rivers, for Spain. They each had at their disposal 40 Taíno slaves .  Good friends, they elaborated a plan to travel to a hard to reach, secret place in order to excavate and find gold for themselves and their own fortunes.   \\n\nImmediately upon finding a large piece of gold that they had originally agreed to share, their friendship was tested. In conniving to keep the gold, Orozco used fake dice, but then suffered a bad fall. Days later, when his friend Guilarte finally returned with help, Orozco lay dying, and confessed to having used fake dice and asked his friend for forgiveness. Sierra de Orozco , a mountain located in the Cordillera Central , is named after Orozco.   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCapitol of Puerto Rico\nThe Capitol of Puerto Rico , also known as Casa de las Leyes (House of Laws) , and most commonly referred to as El Capitolio (The Capitol) , is the seat of the Legislative Assembly , or the bicameral legislature , composed of the Senate and House of Representatives , responsible for the legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico . Located  on San Juan Islet immediately outside the Walls of Old San Juan , the oceanfront , neoclassical Beaux-Arts -style, entirely white marble -covered edifice was constructed between 1921 and 1929 to resemble the ancient Roman Pantheon in Rome , using as inspiration the Low Memorial Library in New York City . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.    \\n\nHistory\nPrior to the establishment of the Capitol, the Legislative Assembly used the Provincial Delegation Building, which now houses the Department of State .  The idea of constructing a capitol was first introduced by former Resident Commissioner Luis Muñoz Rivera in 1907, and was partly meant to demonstrate some degree of civilian rule in the island, which at the time was already a colony of the United States .  The project proposed by Muñoz Rivera assigned $3 million for the construction and established rules for a contest among architectures to decide which one would do the work.\\n\nIn September 1907, Commissioner of the Interior Laurence Grahame sent the official request for architects through the press and magazines of United States . The specifications for the building were that it was supposed to have three principal installations: the Executive Council, the House of Delegates, and the Supreme Court. It was supposed to be simple, conservative, and appropriate to the island\\'s weather conditions. 134 architectural designs were submitted from the US, Cuba , Canada , France , Spain , and Puerto Rico.\\n\nThe evaluation of the proposals was in charge of William F. Willoughby (president of the Executive Council), José de Diego ( Speaker of the House , represented by Luis Muñoz Rivera ), José S. Quiñones (President of the Supreme Court), and Laurence Grahame. Three American architects were also asked to join the commission: E.B. Homerde, John E. Howe, and Bowen Bancroft Smith. In the end, three projects were selected, belonging to Frank E. Perkins ( New York City ), James H. Ritchie and Lewis B. Abbot ( Boston ), and Henry L. Beadle (New York).\\n\nFinally, the project chosen was the one from Frank E. Perkins, which presented a neoclassical style with little ornamentation. The main halls were organized around a central patio, with the south facade leading to the lobby. The lobby had the dome above, which bore a style similar to the Pantheon in Rome , including the oculus. To the right, there would be a session hall for the Executive Council, and to the left one for the House of Delegates. The Supreme Court would meet in a hall facing north.\\n\nHowever, Luis Muñoz Rivera and the local press preferred another project that was disqualified by the evaluating committee, because the architect had included a slogan in the blueprints, which was forbidden. The project belonged to a Puerto Rican engineer called Carlos del Valle Zeno. Del Valle\\'s project presented a Renaissance style, with neoclassic orders.\\n\nDespite public opinion, Perkins was hired to make the construction blueprints for the Capitol, which were then auctioned. It wasn\\'t until 1920 that the project was retaken when the Commissioner of the Interior, Guillermo Esteves, published a new design. The change came after a revision from the Department of Interior, which found Perkins\\' design to be inappropriate. With the supervision of architects Adrian C. Finlayson, Francisco Roldán, and Pedro de Castro, new blueprints were made using the Renaissance style.\\n\nConstruction of the building eventually began in 1921 under the leadership of Antonio R. Barceló . However, construction was halted after completion of the first level. When Finlayson got ill, he was replaced by Rafael Carmoega who, along with architects Joseph O\\'Kelly, William Schimmelpfennig, Harry Pembleton, Albert Nichols, Luis F. Pina, and Gonzalo Fernós Maldonado, made another design to finish the structure.\\n\nTheir design incorporated some of the elements from Perkins\\'s original design, including the dome. The model for the central structure and the dome was that of the Low Memorial Library at Columbia University .  \\n\nThe building was inaugurated on February 11, 1929, with the first meeting of the Legislative Assembly taking place three days later.\\n\nIt was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1977 as El Capitolio de Puerto Rico .  \\n\nCapitol Building complex\nDesigned in the 1950s by the Toro-Ferrer architectural firm, the Rafael Martínez Nadal building serves as the Senate Annex on the Senate side with offices for senators and two hearing rooms, and the Ernesto Ramos Antonini building serves as the House Annex on the House side with offices for representatives as well as hearing rooms. The Luis Muñoz Marín Office Building houses the Office of Legislative Services , the Luis A. Ferré Building houses offices for both chambers, as well as a 700 space parking garage, while the Antonio R. Barceló Building, former School of Tropical Medicine building houses offices for both chambers, the Legislative Library, and offices for the Superintendent of the Capitol and the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico . The Ramón Mellado Parsons Building houses Senate offices. The buildings that formerly housed the State Commission of Elections in Puerta de Tierra are currently used to house House archives, as well as administrative offices.\\n\nThe frieze on the north fa\\xc3 7ade of the building is inscribed with the following text in Spanish by the first Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , Luis Muñoz Marín :\\n\nThe frieze on the south fa\\xc3 7ade of the building is inscribed with the following Gettysburg Address text in English by the 16th president of the United States of America , Abraham Lincoln :\\n\nArchitectural drawings\nThe Architecture and Construction Archives at the University of Puerto Rico (AACUPR) is the custodian of the Capitol of Puerto Rico Collection (1924-1926). Approximately eight cubic feet in size, the collection contains architectural drawings, photographs and textual documents. The original drawings, executed in ink over drawing cloth, were produced by the Department of the Interior under the supervision of Puerto Rican architect Rafael Carmoega . The 28 originals and 38 blue prints show plans, elevations, sections as well as electrical and plumbing distribution. There is also a proposal for the surrounding gardens by the architectural firm of Bennet, Parsons and Frost and several plates showing entries for the building competition. The collection was transferred to the AACUPR by the Capitol Superintendency in 1986.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The small island is considered part of barrio Playa.  It is home to the 1889 Cardona Island Light , which is listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places . Together with Caja de Muertos , Gatas , Morrillito , Ratones , Isla del Frio , and Isla de Jueyes , Cardona is one of seven islands ascribed to the municipality of Ponce .   The island gained notoriety in 2010 when the Puerto Rican Bird Society made it a target for the eradication of the black rat .\\n\nLocation\nLocated on the Bahía de Ponce , the island has an area of 8.71 acres (3.52 ha).  The island, sometimes erroneously called a key (or cay ), is located at latitude 17°57\"24.3\\' and longitude -66°38\\'5.9\\' (latitude 17.95672N, longitude: -66.634982W  ). The short distance from the mainland shore makes Cardona a popular landing point for aquatic events such as kayaking and summing, and every year the island is visited by dozens of swimmers in the annual Cruce a Nado , an international swimming competition sponsored by the Ponce Municipal Government.    \\n\nName\nThe name \"Cardona\" is believed to come from the last name of a family of lighthouse keepers stationed at the island for many decades. Whatever its origin, the island is now also called \" Sor Isolina Ferré \" in appreciation and to the memory of the religious woman that dedicated her life to the betterment of the residents of Barrio Playa , of which Cardona Island is a part.  \\n\nTourism\nThe island can be seen from the observation tower on the La Guancha boardwalk and is accessible by private boat. Starting in the summer of 2018, tourists can also board a ferry for a trip to the island.  The island offers \"a beautiful, nice snorkeling, some trails to explore, and a lighthouse.\"  The ferry trips ceased in January 2020 after a major earthquake struck the area, but restarted six months later.  The island is administered by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources .  \\n\nGeography and climate\nThe island is mostly a low island covered by brushwood.  The climate is dry and the island supports dry forest .\\n\nBlack rat\nIn 2010, the Sociedad Ornitológica Puertorriqueña (Puerto Rican Bird Society) and the Ponce Yacht and Fishing Club launched a campaign to eradicate the black rat from the island.  \\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCaribe Hilton Hotel\nThe Caribe Hilton is located in San Juan, Puerto Rico , and is owned by Park Hotels & Resorts and managed by Hilton Worldwide . \\n\nHistory\nIn early 1946, as part of the Puerto Rican industrialization effort known as Operation Bootstrap , the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Co. decided to erect a modern luxury hotel. The facility would be owned by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, but leased to the multinational hospitality operator that provided the best bid . The hotel would have 300 bedrooms and the necessary ancillary facilities, and be located adjacent to Fortín de San Gerónimo in Puerta de Tierra.\\n\nA competition was held to select the design, with three architectural firms in Puerto Rico invited: Schimmelpfennig, Ruiz y González; The Office of Henry Klumb ; and Toro Ferrer . Two additional firms from Florida were also invited to participate: Frederick G. Seelman from Palm Beach and Robert Swartburg from Miami. These two firms submitted Spanish Renaissance -style designs, while the three Puerto Rican firms presented modern designs inspired by the International style. The final design chosen was by Toro Ferrer , who also designed the Modern Movement-style Supreme Court Building in San Juan.  \\n\nTo operate the hotel, the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Co. invited seven leading American hotel firms. Conrad Hilton , being from New Mexico, opened his letter back with \"Mi estimado amigo\" and won over the Puerto Ricans.  \\n\nThe creation of the hotel represented a partnership between the Puerto Rican government and U.S business. Americans viewed the creation of the hotel as a symbol of their power to create material progress. A majority of Puerto Rican citizens did not approve of the decision to build the hotel. They believed that the public funds would have better suited the island inhabitants if they were invested in improving education and social welfare. San Juan\\'s fire chief of the time disapproved the government\\'s decision to \"degrade itself by buying tourists.\" Articles published by El Mundo in 1952 saw the American tourists as selfish people who did not care about the island and ones who will in the future convince the Puerto Rican people to serve them.  \\n\nThe Caribe Hilton opened on December 9, 1949.   The government-backed Puerto Rico Industrial Development Corp. ( PRIDCO ) spent $7 million to build and furnish the hotel. After it was built, the government leased the hotel to the Hilton Corp. on a 20-year lease.  The hotel was the first in Puerto Rico to offer radios in every room and individually controlled air conditioners.  \\n\nGuests for the opening included Gloria Swanson , Eastern Air Lines President Eddie Rickenbacker , David Rockefeller and numerous other celebrities and notables.  \\n\nThe hotel claims to be the birthplace of the Piña colada . In 1954, bartender Ramón \"Monchito\" Marrero spent three months creating a mix of rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice. The drink was first served on August 15, 1954.  \\n\nThe original hotel was expanded over the years from 300 rooms to 646 rooms.  After managing the hotel for 48 years, Hilton International bought the property in 1998.  Hilton closed the hotel the following year for a complete renovation, lasting nine months.  It reopened on December 25, 1999 celebrating its 50th anniversary after $50 million in renovations.  \\n\nIn 2005, the hotel was expanded with the huge Paseo Caribe complex, including shops, restaurants, and 264 villas marketed as the Condado Lagoon Villas.  \\n\nIn January 2017, ownership of the hotel was transferred to Park Hotels & Resorts when that company was spun off from Hilton Worldwide.  In September 2017, the hotel was heavily damaged by Hurricane Maria , forcing it to close. It reopened in May 2019, following a US$100 million renovation.   \\n\nFamous guests\nIts first of many famous guests were Gloria Swanson and Gertrude Ederle . Between the 1960s and 1980s, many important performers either worked or stayed at the Caribe Hilton, including Marco Antonio Muñiz . Other famous guests have included many world champion boxers during Puerto Rico \\'s golden era of boxing . The national basketball teams of twelve countries also stayed there for 2003\\'s pre- Olympic tournament of the Americas. [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn popular culture\nPart of the television film Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie was filmed in the outdoor pool area of the hotel. It is also the setting for Hunter S. Thompson \\'s The Rum Diary . 22 Jump Street was also filmed in the lobby of the hotel.\\n\nPhoto gallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°27\\xe2\\x80\\xb250\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°5\\xe2\\x80\\xb26\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.46389°N 66.08500°W ﻿ / 18.46389; -66.08500 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCarite State Forest\nCarite State Forest  is a state forest and nature reserve located in the Sierra de Cayey mountain range in southeastern Puerto Rico . The forest extends over approximately 2,600 hectares (6,500 acres) and is located in the municipalities of Caguas , Cayey , Guayama , Patillas and San Lorenzo . The forest is located along the Ruta Panorámica (officially the Luis Muñoz Marín Scenic Route ), which offers access to the forest.\\n\nHistory\nCarite State Forest is one of 20 forestry units in the territory of Puerto Rico. This forest area was established by a proclamation in 1935 and was formerly listed as a state forest on July 1, 1975, through the Law of Puerto Rican Forests (Law Num. 133). The area was preserved with the intention of developing it for its timber industry . The state forest was established with the goal of protecting the hydrological basins of the Loíza , Patillas and La Plata rivers which were being affected by erosion caused by deforestation throughout the 20th century. In more recent times the forest has become an important wildlife preserve, ecological research site and recreational area.  \\n\nGeography\nThis forest is located within the Sierra de Cayey mountain range. This range belongs to the larger Cordillera Central which extends through Puerto Rico from west to east. The highest point of the Sierra at 2,962 feet (903 m) in elevation, Cerro La Santa ( Spanish for peak of the saint or peak of the holy woman ), is located within the forest in the municipalities of Caguas, Cayey and San Lorenzo.  This is the highest point in those three municipalities.\\n\nThe mountains in the Carite Forest are of volcanic origin. The underlying rocks in the area located between the surface of the forest and depths of 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) were created as a result of volcanic activity that took place during the Early Cretaceous period between 79 and 144 million years ago. About 13 types of soil can be found within the forest region.  \\n\nThe climate of the forest is humid and cool; the most humid time of the year is between the months of May and October, analogous to the wet season of the island and the region\\'s hurricane season. The average annual temperature is of 22 °C (72 °F) and the average annual precipitation measurement is 2,200 millimetres (85 in).  \\n\nEcology and conservation\nThe forest is an important wildlife refuge and is home to 49 species of birds (9 of which are endemic), 15 species of amphibians, 12 species of reptiles and 7 species of mammals. About 9 species of animals that live in the forest are listed as endangered or threatened species, some of which are the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk ( Buteo platypterus brunnescens ), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk ( Accipiter striatus venator ), the elfin woods warbler ( Setophaga angelae ), Eneida\\'s coquí ( Eleutherodactylus eneidae ), the web-footed coqui ( Eleutherodactylus karlschmidti ), the Puerto Rican rock frog or coquí guajón ( Eleutherodactylus cooki ), and the Puerto Rican boa ( Chilabothrus inornatus ).  \\n\nThe area is renowned for its population of Puerto Rican plain pigeons or paloma sabanera ( Patagioenas inornata wetmorei ) which were formerly on the brink of extinction but were saved thanks to conservation efforts and is now considered stable. The golden coquí ( Eleutherodactylus jasperi ) used to be found in this forest but no specimens have been found in recent years and the species are now considered extinct.\\n\nCarite is home to more than 204 species of trees out of which 176 species are native. There are 43 endemic species of plants such as the Puerto Rican magnolia ( Magnolia portoricensis ) and the Puerto Rican raintree ( Brunfelsia portoricensis ). The forest is also home to the Luquillo Mountain stopper or uvillo ( Eugenia haematocarpa ), an endangered myrtle which can only be found in El Yunque National Forest and Carite State Forest.  \\n\nThe forest\\'s vegetation can be classified into three ecological zones: the subtropical moist forest of Sierra palm trees which comprises 9% of the forest, the very humid subtropical moist forest which comprises more than 98% of the forest area and is home to the elfin or dwarf forest , and the low montane humid forest which only comprises about 0.5% of the forest area and is home to the palo colorado ( Cyrilla racemiflora ).   \\n\nRecreation\nRecreation in the forest is managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA). There are opportunities of camping, picnics and swimming. There used to be up to 25 hiking trails in the forest area; however, many of the trails have not been properly maintained, and some have never been reopened after being completely destroyed by hurricanes such as Georges and Maria . The only currently maintained trail is the Charco Azul Trail which leads to the Charco Azul swimming area.  \\n\nThe DRNA offices are open Monday to Friday from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The recreation areas are open from about 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Most of the areas designated for camping and picnics are located uphill from Guavate in Cayey (in the past, the forest has also been referred to as the Guavate Fores t) close to the famous lechoneras . The picnic area close to the Guavate lechoneras have not been opened after being destroyed by Hurricane Maria and the only maintained picnic area is located in the Charco Azul section of the forest. As of 2020, camping areas have not yet reopened after the destruction caused by the hurricane.\\n\nCharco Azul (Spanish for blue pool) , located in the municipality of Patillas , is one of the main highlights of the state forest. This is a clear, blue-colored natural pool formed by the Charco Azul river falls, which flow into the Patillas River . The area, located along PR-184 , offers sites for picnics, camping and showers and restrooms for people who wish to swim in it.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal sites"

As part of the construction, the dam included three hydroelectric turbines with a total capacity of 3 Megawatts for the provision of electricity. However, during the 1960s and 1970s, the turbines were shut down because their operation and maintenance wasn\\'t considered cost-effective versus the cost of buying energy at the time.  \\n\nIn 1989 Hurricane Hugo caused overtopping of the dam, thereby flooding the hydroelectric facility and rendering it inoperable. It stayed closed until 2013, when PRASA elected to renovate the facility.  \\n\nIn 2017 Hurricane Maria caused overtopping and flooding to nearby areas.\\n\nOperation\nCarraízo dam is a concrete gravity dam . It features eight floodgates along its 210-meter body. The floodgates open at a height of 1 to 10 meters, but they are usually opened at 4 meters.

        "page_content": "Contents\nCasa Fernando Luis Toro\n\\n\nCasa Fernando Luis Toro (English: Fernando Luis Toro Home ) is a historic house in Ponce, Puerto Rico . The house is unique in that it is located in the first upper-class suburban development built in Puerto Rico, La Alhambra.  \\n\nIn 1990 La Alhambra was designed as part of Ponce\\'s historic district . The house dates to 1927 and was designed by the famed Puerto Rican architect Francisco Porrata Doria . It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 5 March 1986, as Fernando Luis Toro Casa .  It is also known as Casa Chavier . The house was sold by its original owners in the early 1970s to Mr. Jorge Chavier and his wife Ms. Hilda de Lis who still occupied the house in 1986.  \\n\nHistory\nThe house was built in 1927. It was designed by Francisco Porrata Doria , a well-known architect from Ponce. The house is located in the La Alhambra sector of the city, a well-to-do area developed in the early twentieth century.  La Alhambra was the first upper-class suburban development in Puerto Rico.  In 1990, La Alhambra was designated part of the Ponce Historic Zone .\\n\nArchitecture\nThe house draws from architectural designs commonly seen in Coral Gables and West Palm Beach, Florida .  The house, for example, is located in a large lot, surrounded by presumptuous landscaping. The property is one of three adjoining properties that belong to three wealthy brothers. The three residences are connected in their backyards.  An elegant front concrete wall serves as a common fence. The most outstanding feature of the interior is the core location of the living room.  While most of the floors are wooden, the terrace and the dining room have mosaic-tiled floors.  The kitchen, service hall, and pantry have local tiles of various colors and designs.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe Toro residence is located in an elegant residential area of Ponce called La Alhambra. This was the first large, upper\\xe2\\x88\\x92class suburban expansion developed in Puerto Rico in the early 1900s. Much in the style of Coral Gables and West Palm Beach in Florida, residences were sited on unusually large lots which allowed for elaborate and formal landscaping.  \\n\nThe combination of eclectic architectural elements displayed in this house makes it one of the better examples of the designs of the locally well-known architect Francisco Porrata Doria. His distinct style was based on the integration of diverse architectural influences such as: Victorian , Georgian , Neo-classic , academic Beaux Arts , Spanish Revival and Catalan modernism (from Catalonia, Spain ; land which capital is Barcelona ). Architect Porrata Doria is responsible for the design of some of the most important buildings in Ponce, of which the Teatro Fox Delicias and the Banco de Ponce facing the town square, are among his best projects. Significant representations of early 20th\\xe2\\x88\\x92century design concepts implemented in Ponce architecture are the Toro residence\\'s L-shaped balcony, the use of tile, mosaic, stained glass, and the emphasis placed on the dining room within the organizing scheme.  \\n\nPhysical appearance\nConstructed of reinforced concrete, the Toro residence was designed and built in 1927 for Mr. Fernando Luis Toro by architect Francisco Porrata Doria, a locally prominent designer. The residence is one of three properties, with connecting patios, belonging to three brothers. The U-shaped floor plan exhibits a perpendicular extension towards the East. Most important to the spatial distribution is the centrally located living room. Off this main space, six composite doors with arched transoms of stained glass lead into adjacent interior corridors on both sides. Two doors lead to the balcony. On the North side of this space, is the most ornamented doorway of Georgian decoration which is flanked by a set of doric pilasters crowned by a cornice. The hung ceiling of the living room is detailed in a pentagonal pattern of thin wooden slats. The North doorway leads into the enclosed terrace whose back wall is angled in four sections. At the intersection of these angles, there is a set of double columns. Colored glass provides the space with diffused light. A high-glazed ceramic tile wainscot of elaborate patterns contains the inscription in Arabic: \"God is Allah and Muhammad his only prophet.\"  \\n\nOn the South end of the West wing is the formal dining room. The main ornaments of this space are a pair of twin windows with arched transoms of stained glass and four deep ceiling wood beams with ornate brackets supporting them at each end. The remainder of the West wing houses the service and semi-public areas of the house such as: the pantry, a breakfast room, the kitchen, a service patio, and the maid\\'s quarters (presently an office). The East extension of the plan contains three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a drawing room, and an office space with a private entrance.  Even though most of the house has wooden flooring, the dining room and enclosed terrace have extraordinary mosaic floors. The kitchen, service corridor, and pantry have multi-colored cement tiles of varying patterns.  \\n\nThe exterior, although sober, is elegant. Cast-in-place, bas-relief flower motifs are found on the dining room area exterior facade and general cornice line. Red, curved clay tiles cover the L-shaped balcony and provide the white facade with color. Ten sets of double columns with a shared capital are located on the \"maenianum\" style balcony railing and act as supports for the balcony roof. Geometrical-shaped head moldings surround all exterior doors and windows for decorative purposes as well as partial weather protection. To the East of the main house there is a formal garden with a fountain located at its center. Four large classical urns provide focal points at diagonal locations to the fountain, and paved, patterned walkways provide varied pedestrian connections between the spaces. Other structures on the site are a coach house or garage, recently turned into an apartment, a cistern tower, and a storage shed .  \\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCasa Font-Ubides\n\\n\nCasa Font-Ubides (English: Font-Ubides House), also known as the Residencia Monsanto (English: Monsanto Residence) is a historic building located on the north side of Castillo Street in Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the city\\'s historic district . The building dates from 1913.  It was designed by the architect Blas Silva . The architecture consists of 19th Classical revival and Art Nouveau architectural styles. The building is of architectural significance for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornaments .  The complete preservation of the original architecture of the Monsanto Residence, its unique design amongst the houses of Ponce, and its location within the historic urban core of the city qualify it as one of a series of grand houses and an integral part of the character of Ponce.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe Monsanto Residence at Calle Castillo No.34 is an architectural landmark in the city of Ponce. Designed by the well-known architect Blas Silva in 1913, the residence stands out among the great houses of Ponce for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornament. Adapting the curves of the \" Art Nouveau \" to the persistent Neo-classicism of Puerto Rico and the recently born Creole vocabulary of Ponce, Silva succeeded in creating a movement in architecture which broke away from the traditional forms while remaining within them. The traditional continuous raised verandah along the front facade is broken up into two and twisted out of its usual linearity into the curved forms preserved today. Characteristic of the architecture to abound in Ponce contemporaneous to Castillo 34 is a profusion of appliqué, and eclectic combination and juxtaposition of shapes, particularly curvilinear, and a general ostentation of articulation. Blas Silva was probably the most established of the \"wedding-cake architects\" and was thus sought after mostly by the \"nouveau riche\" of the period. Silva\\'s houses are among the richest in Ponce, among which the Monsanto Residence stands put for its circular porches. Other buildings by Blas Silva include the Frau Residence and the Salazar-Candal Residence , both also listed in the NRHP .  \\n\nPhysical appearance and description\nThe Monsanto Residence, located at 34 Castillo Street, is a one-storey, detached, masonry and stone building on the north side of the street, between Virtud and Salud Streets, in the Ponce Historic Zone . The house consists of plastered masonry at the living level and pinkstone ashlar at the podium . Excessive ornamentation and exuberance of volumes denominates this house as what is known locally as \"wedding cake architecture.\"  \\n\nThe facade is organized into three similar bays , each one consisting of a narrow, arched doorway with wooden panel double-doors, stained-glass lights and tiffany-style stained-glass fanlights. The central entrance doors contain wrought-iron panels in curved Art Nouveau lines. Each opening is articulated with intricate, decorative plaster surrounds and flaked with plaster festoon mouldings . In addition, the central entry is crowned with a plaster cartouche displaying the initials of the first owners, PF ( P rovidencia Ubides and F ederico Font).  \\n\nA heavily ornamented three-bay facade is shaded by two gazebo -like front terraces. Each bay consists of a series of four Corinthian columns upon pedestals , arranged around a 3/4-circle plan. Decorative wrought-iron railings in curvilinear Art Nouveau designs span between each of the pedestals.  \\n\nEach series of columns supports a cornice with a festooned frieze and a parapet above, decorated with circular-wreath balusters . The cornice wraps around the two porches, connecting the two in a curved pediment motif above the central entrance. Roman amphorae are located above the parapet, one at the location of each column.  \\n\nA second-floor \"mirador\" or \" belvedere \" projects upward above the first bay in a baroque manner. The volume is generally cubical in proportions, capped with an upwardly-curving cornice on each of its four sides, thus creating a groin-vault roof and ceiling. A small masonry pinnacle is located above the cornice at each of the four corners of the mirador and a circular oculus with stained glass panels occupies each of the four sides.  \\n\nA curvilinear stair or \" stoop \" conforms to the space available between the podiums of the two terraces, flowing up to the central entry. Once inside, a long, narrow hallway extends back from the street entry. Parlors and bedrooms open onto the hallway at either side, and the hallway terminates at a grand dining room at rear, with a kitchen at left and a terrace along the entire rear wall of the house. The upper level mirador is accessed by a cast-iron spiral staircase located on the southeast corner of the parlor at bay 1. Characteristic interior features of the house include: decorative native ceramic tile floors, intricate, pressed-tin ceilings in biblical motifs , and skillfully carved wooden fanlights.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCasa Oppenheimer\n\\n\nCasa Oppenheimer (English: Oppenheimer House) is a historic house in Ponce, Puerto Rico , designed in 1913 by famed Puerto Rican architect Alfredo B. Wiechers .  The house is unique among other historic structures in historic Ponce for its skillful incorporation of front gardens in a very limited urban space.  The historic building is located at 47 Salud Street, in the city\\'s historic district , at the northwest corner of Salud and Aurora streets. The house is also known as Casa del Abogado (House of the Attorney).  In April 2019, the house was turned into Casa Mujer by MedCentro, a women\\'s health business concern.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Oppenheimer House is one of Ponce\\'s most distinctive residential structures. It was designed in 1913 for Doña Isabel Oppenheimer-de Santiago [ a ] by one of Puerto Rico\\'s foremost early 20th century architects, Alfredo Weichers. Two years earlier, in 1911, he had built Casa Serralles , which today is home to the Museum of Puerto Rican Music .  Mr. Weichers left Puerto Rico to study architecture in Barcelona, Spain , and returned to Ponce where he built various structures in the Spanish-Art Nouveau style. Weichers designed many of the mansions of Ponce\\'s aristocratic society of his time. The Oppenheimer residence is one such structure. Architecturally, the house is the result of an artful combination of elements from the contemporary modernist movement and the simpler townspeople\\'s building traditions used in the hot southern coast of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nProminent in this property is the used of a chamfered front entrance gate. This front entrance into the property follows the chamfered pattern delineated by the city street at the corner of Salud and Aurora streets. This designed responded to city ordinances which mandated the incorporation of chamfered corners in urban city lots.  This design, along with the use of a mirror-image chamfered design of the front of the house proper, provided the property with a significant amount of frontal garden space, uncommon in city lots just two blocks from Ponce\\'s main Plaza , as is the case of this house.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe residence is \"one of the best examples in Ponce of the Puerto Rican adaptation of the architecture of the Barcelona School , and forms an integral part of the series of late 19th and early 20th century grand houses which defines the unique urban character of the center of Ponce.\"  \\n\nArchitecture\nThe house is a raised, one- storey , brick and masonry residential structure on the northwest corner of Salud and Aurora streets, in Ponce\\'s Historic Zone . It is oriented on a diagonal axis with respect to the street corner.  The main facade of the house face the street corner. At both ends of this frontal facade, the house plan turns an angle so that the front facade becomes first perpendicular and then parallel to the corresponding side street. The property is surrounded by a 4-foot plastered masonry wall with an 18-inch high wrought iron railing above. The small, diagonal front chamfered gate is also built in wrought-iron.  The frontal facade consists of a concave shape and incorporates a podium porch, Ionic columns, a recessed loggia , and a cornice with a battlement parapet above.  The raised loggia porch incorporates concrete balustrades the full length of the balcony. The loggia porch is reached from the front gardens via a wide  masonry stairway. The loggia incorporates five bays that establish the central section of the frontal concave facade. The front is highlighted by five arched windows.  \\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCasa Paoli\n\\n\nCasa Paoli (English: Paoli House) is a historic house and biographical museum in barrio Cuarto , Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the Ponce Historic Zone . The house is significant as the birthplace of Antonio Paoli (1871-1946), a tenor who was the \"first Puerto Rican to reach international recognition in the performing arts\"  and \"one of the most outstanding opera singers of all times\".  The house was the childhood home of the artist and he was introduced to art and opera at this house during his formative years. In 1987, the house was turned into a museum to honor the career of Antonio Paoli.  The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2009.  \\n\nHistory\nThe house had been a wedding gift for Paoli\\'s parents, who married at the Ponce Cathedral after the birth of the first five of their eight children. Antonio, their seventh child, was born in the house, as were two of his siblings.  The house is significant as it is the birthplace of one of the greatest opera singers of all times.  It was the house Paoli occupied during his formative years. Just a few blocks from Teatro La Perla , Casa Paoli provided easy access for Paoli to Ponce\\'s single most important theatrical arts venue. For his powerful and lyric voice, Antonio Paoli was considered the \"King of the Tenors\". As he sang for numerous kings around the world, Paoli is also known as the \"Tenor of the Kings\".  \\n\nArchitecture\nThe front facade of the residence consists of eye-catching peach and white brick masonry and stucco front porch with a main arched balcony crowned by a female face. A second, smaller, arched entrance is the main entryway into the porch and house. Early 1900s ironworks gracefully separate the front porch from the front street sidewalk. The front doors of the house are wooden louvered characteristic of the middle-to-late 19th century. A circular front wall wind hole with decorative molding accentuates the porch; another smaller circular opening decorates high above the archway into the porch. The interior consists of nine rooms, a long, sunny, lateral hallway with multiple wooden veneer shutters, and an external cobble-stone foyer leading to the back courtyard.  \\n\nThe architectural style is described as Neoclassical , with other 20th century elements.  The house was built as a wooden structure before 1864, when it was acquired by Domingo Paoli, the father of Antonio Paoli. By 1870, the house had been upgraded into a wood and brick masonry residence. In 1914 it was upgraded into the current brick and stucco structure by the prominent local architect and civil engineer Manuel V. Domenech .  \\n\nAntonio Paoli\nAntonio Paoli was born in this house on April 14, 1871. From a young age, he would accompany his parents to opera performances at the Teatro La Perla, located some six blocks from this house. An inspiring performance there by the Italian tenor Pietro Baccei  helped him decide what he wanted to be \"when he grew up\". His parents nurtured his ambition by enrolling him in a voice training school. However, when Antonio was just 12 years old his parents died. Paoli moved to Spain to live with his sister, Amalia , who was also a singer. Amalia also encouraged her younger brother to pursue his dream of becoming an opera singer.  \\n\nAfter studying at the Royal Monastery of El Escorial in Madrid, Spain , and the Academia de Canto La Scala in Milan, Italy , Paoli made his debut in Paris. He went on to earn numerous honors and awards around the world and came to be affectionately known as both \"The King of Tenors\" and as \"The Tenor of the Kings\". He returned to Puerto Rico in 1917. Antonio and Amalia established a voice training school in San Juan. They also helped in theater productions at San Juan\\'s Municipal Theater. In 1934, the San Juan Municipal Theater was renamed The Antonio Paoli Theater in his honor.  \\n\nPaoli died on August 24, 1946, and was buried in the Puerto Rico Memorial Cemetery in Isla Verde . On April 13, 2005, his remains were exhumed and transferred to Ponce\\'s Roman Baldorioty de Castro National Pantheon .  Antonio Paoli is considered to be the first Puerto Rican to achieve international fame in the musical arts. The museum at Casa Paoli gives visitors insight into the fascinating life story and achievements of Puerto Rico\\'s \"Tenor of the Kings\".  \\n\nMuseum and research center\nToday Casa Paoli functions as a museum research center on Puerto Rican culture. The building is the headquarters of the Centro de Investigaciones Folkloricas de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Center for Folkloric Research).  The Center\\'s mission is to foster Puerto Rico\\'s cultural traditions as well as popular arts. The Center purchased the property from Antonio Penna Salicrup and his family in 1987 to preserve the history of this lyrical singer and his family.  Centro de Investigaciones Folkloricas de Puerto Rico used to be housed at Calle Marina street #27, at the Zaldo de Nebot Residence , but moved to Casa Paoli\\'s around the spring or summer of 1987.   \\n\nThe museum consists of three exposition rooms where photographs, correspondence in the form of post cards, etc., and other memorabilia are displayed.  Among the offerings of this museum is a shop displaying colorful papier-m\\xc3 2ché masks used in Ponce\\'s annual Carnival celebrations . The current museum exhibits documents and other memorabilia from the life of this well respected singer, along with examples of Puerto Rican art and a history of the city of Ponce.\\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

It was designed as a residence for the wealthy sugar planter Antonio Roig by the prominent Czech architect and Puerto Rico resident Antonin Nechodoma (1877-1928  ) and built in 1920.\\n\nDescription\nCasa Roig was built in the Prairie School style in 1920. The house has a cruciform plan, has two floors and a basement. It is made of concrete and wood and decorated lavishly with stained glass and mosaics.  The design follows the Prairie House School style of the architect Louis Sullivan, but especially the unique style of the renowned American architect Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959).  \\n\nThe house was inhabited until 1956. From then on it remained closed until August 13, 1977, when the heirs of Antonio Roig donated the residence to the University of Puerto Rico who adopted the mission to restore and preserve the structure.  The work of restoration was carried out by the architects Otto Reyes and Tom Marvel over a period of 10 years. Casa Roig opened its doors to the public in 1989 and since then has served as a physical footprint and testimony of the Prairie School style adapted to the Caribbean, and as a center for cultural diffusion. Casa Roig is considered among the best works of Nechodoma and is the only residential structure built by Nechodoma which still remains complete.  \\n\nThe house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1977,  and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones on May 16, 2001.  \\n\nThe museum\\'s roof sustained damages when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in September 2017.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n\nThis article about a property in Puerto Rico on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub .

It was built for one of the heirs of Juan Eugenio Serrallés Perez, son of businessman Juan Serrallés Colón , founder of Destilería Serrallés , and himself the CEO of the company that founded Ron Don Q . The building was purchased by the government of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce in 2008 for its architectural, historic, and cultural value. As of February 2012, the building was being restored to convert it into an annex of the Museo de la Historia de Ponce to depict the 1985 Mameyes tragedy of barrio Portugues Urbano in Ponce. In 2014 it opened as \"Museo de la Recordacion Barrio Mameyes\" (Barrio Mameyes Memorial Museum) under Ponce mayor María Meléndez at Calle Salud 67.  It is also known as \"Sala Memorial del Barrio Mameyes\" as it operates as a part of the Museo de la Historia de Ponce .  \\n\nHistory\nIn 1979 the house became the home of Rosita Serrallés Sánchez and her husband Guillermo Torruella Fornaris. Rosita and Guillermo had been living at the more spacious hilltop Castillo Serrallés mansion until Guillermo fell ill in 1979. Rosita Serrallés Sánchez was the daughter of Juan Eugenio Serrallés and Rosa María Sánchez, the couple that ordered the building of the spacious Castillo Serralles on the El Vigia Hill in Ponce. Upon Juan Eugenio and Rosa Maria\\'s death, Rosita and Guillermo came to occupy the big hilltop mansion.  \\n\nIn 2008, the municipality of Ponce purchased the house from Rosa María (\"Rosita\") Torruella Serrallés, and her two brothers, Alberto J. Torruella Serrallés and Guillermo J. Torruella Serrallés.  It was purchased for $364,807, under the administration of mayor Francisco Zayas Seijo .

        "page_content": "Contents\nCasa Salazar-Candal\n\\n\nCasa Salazar-Candal (English: Salazar-Candal House ) is a historic building located on the southeast corner of Isabel and Mayor Cantera streets in Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the city\\'s historic district . The building dates from 1911.  It was designed by the architect Blas Silva . The architecture consists of 19th Classical revival , Art Nouveau and Spanish Revival architectural styles.  Today the Salazar-Candal Residence houses the Museum of the History of Ponce .\\n\nHistory\nCasa Salazar was designed in 1911 by Blas Silva Boucher as the residence of Dr. Guillermo Salazar Palau and his wife Sara Isabel Rivera Carbonell. The house was a Guillermo Salazar Palua\\'s wedding gift to his wife Sara Isabel.  Later, it became the headquarters of the Alianza Nacionalista de Ponce (Ponce Nationalist Alliance) and later on yet, the headquarters for the Liga Progresista de Ponce (Ponce Progressive League), an organization seeking to preserve and advance the social, cultural, and commercial interest of the city during the first half of the twentieth century.  \\n\nSignificance\nCasa Salazar-Candal is one of a group of stylistically eclectic houses built in Ponce between 1900 and 1915. Designed by architect Blas C. Silva Bouscher in 1911, the building reflects an emerging tendency to incorporate freely diverse and competing architectural motifs . The facade is distinctly rendered in Roccoco and moorish detailing to emphasize its bifunctional character as a home and an office respectively. The portion of the structure designed to shelter the family is refined, delicately ornamented and asymmetrical. It utilizes a balcony, raised and detached from the street as a transitional zone between the public and the private sphere.  \\n\nIn contrast to the refinement and gentility of the house expressed by its fluted corinthian columns, floral surrounds and composite entablure, the office is fashioned as a moorish garrison exhibiting a crenelated parapet , horseshoe arches with simplified surrounds and planar surfaces. The building plane of the office is pushed forward to meet the sidewalk for public access in order to further express its utilitarian function.  \\n\nMaster craftsman Elias Concepcion has been credited with the execution of the interior finishes. His handling of the ornamental elements ranges from the curvilinear and stylized floral motifs present in the stained glass of the double doors, to the rectilinear wood screen\\xe2\\x80\\x94reminiscent of the Arts and Crafts movement - dividing the foyer from the living room. As with the exterior, the interior is a mixture of distinct stylistic elements. The vestibule\\'s repousse sheet metal ornamentation reflects the roccoco treatment of the exterior, at once maintaining an image of opulence and refinement for the visitor while creating a transitional device for the predominantly planar interior surfaces. Many highstyle interiors of the beginning of the 20th century in the Ponce and Yauco region have been attributed to Elias Concepcion due to his sophisticated integration and subtle resolution of an eclectic vocabulary.  \\n\nPhysical appearance and description\nThe house is located on a plot of land measuring 31 meters (on Isabel Street), by 13 meters (on Mayor Street), to the South 45 meters and to the East 22 meters. It was built in 1911 in reinforced concrete, brick and stone, and its roof was partly built in concrete and partly in timber with corrugated iron sheets.  \\n\nThe house is L-shaped in plan and consists of a main body where the public spaces and bedrooms are located. An extension, known commonly as the \"martillo\", completes the \"L\" shape and is where the kitchen and service quarters are located.  \\n\nThe facade employs classical elements mixed with moorish influenced details It is divided in three main sections; an ample balcony that corresponds to the family dwelling flanked by two enclosed spaces used formerly as the medical offices of the original owners. Access to this commercial space is directly from the street. The main doors are of a particular design in using the lobulated arch as a motif. These doors have stained glass panels in the Art Nouveau style. The residence balcony is raised over a rusticated-stone plinth. It is divided into four bays by the use of five paired and fluted corinthian columns . An Italian-influenced balustrade serves as the balcony railing. A cornice, neoclassical in style, runs the whole of the house\\'s facade as well as the crenelated parapet over the office space. The staircase leading to the \\'piano nobile\\' of the house is enhanced and accentuated in the parapet by an elaborated \\'cartouche\\' indicating the date of construction of the house.  \\n\nFrom the street, through the staircase and the main entrance, a foyer leads to an interior courtyard from which all the spaces of the house are distributed. Special features of the interior are the stained glass panels in the living room, showing a strong moorish influence in its form (lobulated arches) and its colour. The doors have louvered panels and stained glass insets. The living room, the studio and the bedrooms have pressed tin ceilings.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCasa Wiechers-Villaronga\nCasa Wiechers-Villaronga is a Classical Revival style mansion in Ponce, Puerto Rico designed and built in the early twentieth century. The house was acquired and restored by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture and now operates as the Museo de la Arquitectura Ponceña (Museum of Ponce Architecture). The house sits in the Ponce Historic Zone . The Villaronga Residence is an outstanding example of the Classical Revival style in used in Ponce designs in the early part of the 20th century and is one of two residences still standing of a series of houses designed and built by Alfredo B. Wiechers , so important to the architectural and cultural heritage of the city of Ponce.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe Wiechers-Villaronga Residence was built in 1912 by Alfredo B. Wiechers, architect, for his own residence and studio, which he sold later to Mr. Julio Mercado, who in turn give it to his daughter, Elena Mercado and her husband Mr. Gabriel Villaronga as a wedding present. Wiechers was born in Ponce and studied at the School of Architecture in Paris, France, in 1901, where he was bestowed a gold medal for outstanding achievement and excellence during his professional studies. He graduated in 1905 and worked at the office of Enric Sagnier , a famous Spanish architect, in Barcelona, Spain . In 1911, he decided to work and live in Ponce; thus he designed and built his house and studio which he opened in 1912. In a short period of time, from 1911 to 1918, Wiechers was commissioned with various important buildings such as: the Loggia Aurora, Club Deportivo de Damas, the Havana Theatre, Banco of Ponce Building , and Santo Asilo de Damas Hospital among others, where he fully expressed the European Neo-Classical style which he learned from, and was influenced by, Enric Sagnier.  \\n\nThe Neo-Classical influence is manifested in most of his buildings and particularly in the Villaronga residence for its richness and highly decorative details ( pilasters , rusticated podium , cornices , \" candelabra \", relief and motifs , Ionic capitols, etc. are some of the decorative details of the Neo-Classical trend). The Villaronga Residence is an outstanding example of this style and is one of two residences still standing of a series of houses designed and built by Wiechers, so important to the architectural and cultural heritage of the city of Ponce.  \\n\nOf special importance is the fact that all the furniture is original, including the bathroom appliances. Most of the furniture belongs to the Modernisme style (Catalan Art Nouveau ) and were imported from Barcelona, Spain .  The hanging tapestry were painted by Librado Net .  \\n\nHistory\nThe structure was designed in 1911 by its original owner, the local Ponce architect Alfredo Wiechers. It was built in the same year by Elías Concepción Albizu. In 1918, the house was acquired by the Villaronga Mercado family.  The house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as Villaronga House .  \\n\nArchitecture\nThe structure is considered \"treasure trove of culture\",  a jewel amongst the many antique Ponce mansions that have been preserved and converted into museums. The building possesses elaborate neoclassical details, a majestic roof-top gazebo, and a full set of original and custom-made Catalan modernist furniture. There are also well-preserved shower and bathroom fixtures.  \\n\nPhysical appearance\nThe Wiechers-Villaronga Residence is a U-shaped, one-storied structure, measuring 68\\'-10\" in width by 95\\'-2\" in length, located at the northeast corner of Reina and Mendez Vigo Streets. Behind all its highly elaborated decoration, with European Baroque influence, essentially the structure is Neo-Classic in style, making a unique and yet elegant combination of both styles. The building rests on a rusticated stone podium ; its facades and main walls are of brick masonry with some interior partitions and walls of the gallery and kitchen in wood. Wooden beams supports a galvanized zinc roof. The windows and doors of the building are wooden with movable louvers and fixed colored glass inlets. A variety of flooring material is used throughout the house: from native cement-colored tiles in the dining area and vestibule , 1\" by 6\" tongue-and-groove wood slats in the living area and bedrooms, and ceramic tiles in the bathroom, to marble tiles at the entry-way.  \\n\nThe Baroque\\'s influence is manifested immediately on the building\\'s rounded corners, typical of these residence types in Ponce. The corner is framed by two rusticated pilasters and divided into three bays, by two pilaster strips or lesenes . Each bay contains a wooden movable louvreed window with glass inlets at its top, and a floral relief motif over the fenestration . The rest of the wall is decorated with floral garlands . The corner is accentuated with a round sitting nook or \"glorieta\", that is detailed with Ionic columns. Another interesting feature of the house are the balconies which are divided into three sections with Ionic columns and framed with Baroque moldings and sculptured faces on the central top part of the openings. The forged-iron railings of the balconies are elaborated after the Art Nouveau style. The facades are crowned with a continuous masonry cornice . On top of this cornice, a battlement -type parapet with sculptured lion faces and \" candelabra \" decorates the roof line of the structure.  \\n\nThe main entrance is off-centred and located on Reina Street. The entrance hall is decorated with sculptured tiles and the door is located at the end of a marbled stairway. The interior is well kept and unaltered. The interior areas are painted in different colors and the walls have a decorative plastered Art-Nouveau frieze . The ceiling in most of the areas is decorated embossed tin with a continuous decorative molding at its corners. The gallery and part of the kitchen walls are wooden with fixed wood louvered windows used for better ventilation and light. Other interesting details on the house are: the bathroom fixtures, such as the shower stall and the ceramic wall tiles which were imported from Barcelona, Spain , the light fixtures\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as the ones at the dining-room, the master bedroom and living room\\xe2\\x80\\x94which were also imported from Spain, and a \"medio punto\" at the dining area, typical of the architecture of this Southern area of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nOwner\nAlfredo Wiechers Pieretti himself designed the house. He was the son of a German colonist and his Corsican wife. He was born in Ponce and educated at the Paris\\' L\\'Ecole Spéciale d\\'Architecture. He lived for six years in Barcelona while working at Enric Sagnier i Villavecchia\\'s distinguished studio.  After leaving his architectural mark on the City of Ponce ( Casa Serralles 1911, Casa Oppenheimer 1913) he sold the house to the Villaronga family and fled in 1919 to Barcelona, under political pressure. Although his prolific works (1911-1918) include hotels, stores, mausoleums, and even factories, the majority of his work was done in Ponce\\xe2\\x80\\x94he ventured out of Ponce only to design two structures for wealthy Catalan families in the neighboring mountain towns of Adjuntas and Aibonito .  \\n\nThe house was purchased by Don Julio Mercado, father of Helena Mercado, and given to Helena Mercado as a wedding present upon marriage to Mr. Villaronga.  Fact by Luis R. Mercado, Great Grandchild of Julio Mercado.\\n\nRestoration\nThe house was restored by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (ICP) in the early 1990s and is now opened as the Museum of Puerto Rican Architecture .  Its furnishings - all original - speak to the social history in the city during the early twentieth century. The various rooms of the residence display aspects of Ponce\\'s architecture.  \\n\nMuseum\nThe museum opened in 1996 as the home of the Ponce Architecture and Urban Planning Museum .  The goal was to showcase Ponce\\'s rich architectural heritage.    The structure is considered a \"gem of fine Art Nouveau from a bygone era\".  It has an extensive collection of displays and photos of master works from Blas Silva Boucher , Francisco Porrata Doria , Alfredo Wiechers Pieretti and other prominent local architects from the early 20th century.  \\n\nThe city of Ponce, considered by some as the \"irrefutable guardian of Puerto Rican criollismo \",  was selected as a member of the prestigious Art Nouveau Route of the European Union for its \"world preservation of modernist heritage\".  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCasona Césari\nThe Antonio Mattei Lluberas Residence , also known as La Casona Césari (Spanish for \\'the Césari Manor\\') and the House of the Twelve Doors ( La Casa de las Doce Puertas ), is a historic late 19th-century manor house located in Yauco Pueblo , the administrative and historic center of the municipality of Yauco, Puerto Rico .  The house was designed by architect Antonio Mattei Lluberas and built in 1893 by Angelo Cesari Poggi ( \\xc3\\x81ngel Césari Poggi in its localized Spanish spelling) of the Césari Antongiorgi family, a Corsican-Puerto Rican family who was important in the development of the sugarcane industry of Yauco and southwestern Puerto Rico.  \\n\nArchitecture\nThe two storey manor house has a distinctive L-shape that borders the corner of the Matienzo Cintrón and 25 de Julio streets. The main structure is made of thick concrete masonry walls with wooden beams that support a flat brick roof. The wooden window designs became a typeface and inspiration for other private residences that were built afterwards in Yauco and beyond. The house is notable for the integration of various types of traditional construction techniques of time while also importing new techniques foreign in Puerto Rico at the time such as the use of forged cast iron in both the structural and ornamentation systems of the building. The cast iron was built and imported from the Saint-Louis Foundry in Paris . The architectural style of the building is eclectic and foreign in the island at the time of its construction, bringing inspiration from the French Creole designs which were famous in New Orleans at the time.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Cesari manor house is the largest urban property in downtown Yauco and is widely seen as an architectural landmark of the Corsican community of Yauco and Puerto Rico. The house was one of the earliest in Puerto Rico to be designed with a cast-iron girder and brick roof style. Its designer was architect Antonio Mattei Lluberas, after whom the house is often named, a rich landowner of Corsican and Catalan descent who studied architecture in Paris. He later became famous for his opposition to the Spanish control of Puerto Rico and became an independence revolutionary leader in the failed 1896 and 1897 revolts in Guayanilla and Yauco, respectively. The 1897 revolt in Yauco became notable for being the first time when the flag of Puerto Rico was raised in the island.  Mattei Lluberas became exiled after these attempts and returned to become mayor of Yauco during the Spanish-American War . He did not live in the house he designed, which instead became the property of another Corsican businessman - \\xc3\\x81ngel Césari Poggi and his wife, Angela Antongiorgi Rodríguez . This Corsican-Puerto Rican family owned many acres of lands and properties throughout Yauco and southern Puerto Rico which they developed as sugarcane plantations, processing plants and refineries ( centrales ).  \\n\nThe house soon became locally known as the \"House of the Twelve Doors\" ( La Casa de las Doce Puertas ) and, along with the Franceschi Antongiorgi House and the town parish church, it became a historic and architectural landmark of the town. The building has functioned as a private residence, public and private offices and restaurants throughout its existence. It was greatly affected by the 2020 earthquake and has been under constant repair ever since.  The structure along with numerous others have been declared endangered in the earthquake aftermath by the municipal government.  In 2023 the historic center of Yauco was declared a historic district by the Puerto Rico Planning Board and the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture ,  with 222 structures including the Cesari Manor House being included in this designation.   \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCastillo San Cristóbal (San Juan)\nCastillo San Cristóbal ( English : Saint Christopher Castle ) is a fortress in the historic district of Old San Juan , Puerto Rico , known as the largest fortification built by the Spanish in the New World .  Dating back to defense expansions following attacks by the English in 1598 and the Dutch in 1625 , it was first built in 1634 as the Garita del Diablo (\"devil's sentry box \") and an artillery platform .  Over the next 150 years, especially in the reign of King Charles III of Spain , it continued to be developed into a bastion fort to reach its largest size in 1790.  Rising 150 ft from the Atlantic shoreline, the three-level edifice stands on a hill at the northern coastline of San Juan Islet , guarding the land entry to Old San Juan .  San Cristóbal , alongside El Morro , La Fortaleza , and other forts part of the Walls of Old San Juan , protected strategically and militarily important Puerto Rico , or La Llave de las Indias (The Key to the Indies ) ,  from invasion by competing world powers during the Age of Sail . It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983.  \\n\nHistory\nCastillo San Cristóbal was built on a hill originally known as the Cerro de la Horca (\"gallows Hill\") or the Cerro del Quemadero (\"burner's hill\"), changed to Cerro de San Cristóbal in honor of Saint Christopher , the patron of travelers. The fortress is considered the largest fortification built by Spain in the New World . When it was completed in 1783, it covered about 27 acres. The entrances to it were protected by two gates and drawbridges in what was called the Revellín de Santiago (Saint James Ravelin ) and the Bastión de Santiago (Saint James Bastion ). After close to a hundred years of relative peace in the area, this section of the fortification (about a third) was demolished in 1897 to help ease the flow of traffic in and out of the walled city .\\n\nIn 1634, the first defensive structure had been built in the area, the Fortín del Espigón (\"breakwater fort\")or the Garita del Diablo ( \"devil's sentry box\" ) . In 1765, San Cristóbal was conformed by a hornwork surrounded by a dry moat, which gave continuity to the walls of the city, and at the highest point of it, there was a artillery platform, or Caballero de San Miguel (Knight of Saint Michael) , for the emplacement of cannons. San Cristóbal derives its name from the hill on which the main defenses were built against the invasion of the city by land, although it also defended the north coast. By the time the work was completed, it became, the most extensive Spanish fortification in all of the Americas .\\n\nCharles III of Spain came to the Spanish throne in 1759, and in 1764 ordered Field Marshal Alexander O\\'Reilly and the engineers, Colonel Tomás O\\'Daly and Juan Francisco Mestre, to make the island a stronghold, a defense of the first order. The plans constituted the preparation for a war with England , which seemed inevitable. The order coincided with the Siege of Havana temporarily by the English . As a result of O\\'Reily\\'s reforms, the Revellín de San Carlos (Saint Charles Ravelin ) and the counterguard of La Trinidad (The Trinity) were built. Further east, a fort called El Abanico (The Fan) and a battery overlooking the sea, La Princesa (The Princess), were built. By 1788, the year of the king\\'s death, the reforms were complete. The defenses proved their effectiveness since in 1797 they helped to repel the invasion of seven thousand English soldiers commanded by the British general Ralph Abercromby .\\n\nCastillo San Cristóbal also contains five cisterns that were used for the storage of water during the ages of the Spanish Colony. They are extremely large (24 ft tall, 17 ft wide, and 57 ft long) and were used as bomb shelters during World War II .\\n\nHistorical gallery\nHistorical timeline\n1521 - San Juan founded by Spanish settlers from Caparra .\\n\n1539 - Construction of the first fortified defenses at Castillo San Felipe del Morro and La Fortaleza , with batteries aimed at the harbor entrance.\\n\n1595 - The English attack San Juan, led by Sir Francis Drake, 25 ships penetrated the line of fire from El Morro .

One of the guerites at San Cristóbal is called Garita del Diablo (\"devil\\'s sentry box\").  It offers a vantage point to watchmen guarding the seashore while protecting them. This particular sentry box is one of the oldest parts of the fort, being built in 1634.  \\n\nThere are several legends surrounding the sentry box about soldiers disappearing from inside. However, it is mostly believed - and told so in various local stories - that the only soldier that apparently disappeared was a soldier called Sánchez, who fled his post to escape with his girlfriend, called Dina.     \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCastillo San Felipe del Morro\nCastillo San Felipe del Morro ( English : Promontory Castle of Saint Philip), most commonly known as El Morro ( The Promontory ) , is a large fortress and citadel in the historic district of Old San Juan in Puerto Rico . Commissioned by King Charles I of Spain in 1539, it was first built as a fortified tower in honor of King Philip II , who oversaw its expansion into a hornwork fort by 1595. Over the next 200 years, especially in the reign of King Charles III , El Morro continued to be developed to reach its current form in 1787. Rising 140 ft from the Atlantic shoreline with 18 to 25 ft thick walls, the six-leveled edifice stands on a steep, rocky headland promontory on San Juan Islet guarding the entry to San Juan Bay , the harbor of Old San Juan . El Morro , alongside La Fortaleza , San Cristóbal , El Cañuelo , and other forts part of the Walls of Old San Juan , protected strategically and militarily important Puerto Rico , or La Llave de las Indias (The Key to the Indies ),  from invasion by competing world powers during the Age of Sail .  It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983.\\n\nDevelopment\nLying on the northwesternmost point of the islet of Old San Juan , Castillo San Felipe del Morro is named in honor of King Philip II of Spain . The fortification, also referred to as el Morro or \\'the promontory ,\\' was designed to guard the entrance to the San Juan Bay , and defend the Spanish colonial port city of San Juan from seaborne enemies.  \\n\nIn 1983, the citadel was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in conjunction with the San Juan National Historic Site . Over two million visitors a year explore the castillo , making it one of Puerto Rico\\'s leading tourist attractions. Facing the structure, on the opposite side of the bay, a smaller fortification known as El Cañuelo complemented the castillo\\'s defense of the entrance to the bay.   \\n\nStructure for deployment\nThe construction of the citadel and its surrounding walls began in 1539 on orders of King Charles V of Spain .  The original fortress was built under the direction of conquistador Diego Ramos de Orozco and its main purpose was to defend the port of San Juan by controlling the entry to its harbor. In order to have a viable defense while the rest of the fort was being completed, a small proto-fortress was erected during the first year of construction. It is estimated that this section comprises about 10% of the whole structure.\\n\nIt was not till 1587, however, that Field Marshal Juan de Tejeda and the Italian engineer-architect Juan Bautista Antonelli drew the fort\\'s final design. The plan, which was based on the then firmly established Spanish military fortification principles of the time, included fortifying nine other sites in the Spanish Main and Spanish West Indies : Santo Domingo , Santa Marta , Cartagena , Nombre de Dios , Portobelo , the Chagres River , Panama City , Havana , and St. Augustine . San Juan construction began in March 1589 with skilled artisans, 12 stonecutters , 18 masons, 2 smiths, a cooper , metal founder, and an overseer assigned to the task, with the help of 150 slaves. Captain General Diego Menéndez de Valdés, who was the governor of Puerto Rico, took over construction after Tejeda and Antonelli left to start construction of Santo Domingo\\'s fortifications. Capt. Pedro de Salazar took over construction in 1591.  : 29-31 \\n\nThe new fortifications consisted of a hornwork , crossing the headland , to protect the landward side of the existing tower and water battery. Two half- bastions , one on the Atlantic side called \"Tejeda\", and another on the harbor side called \"Austria\", were connected by a curtain wall fronted by a moat , and spanned by a drawbridge in the center. The gate and drawbridge were protected by a ravelin , and just inside the gate was a guardhouse. A pair of batteries behind the hornwork overlooked the sea and harbor.  : 30-31, 54-55 \\n\nIn 1634, construction of the city walls surrounding San Juan began. By 1650, the town was enclosed on the east, south and west, while natural battlements protected the city along the Atlantic.  : 52-55 \\n\nIn 1765, Alejandro O\\'Reilly , Inspector General of Cuba, and Colonel Tomás O\\'Daly, San Juan Chief of Engineers, agreed on a plan to strengthen San Juan\\'s defenses, which was approved by Charles III of Spain . San Juan became a Defense of the First Order, and one of the most powerful plazas in the Americas by 1790. El Morro\\'s improvements included 3 cisterns under the main plaza containing 216,000 gallons of water collected from times of rain. The walls were strengthened to be 18-40 feet thick. These walls consisted of limestone and sandstone blocks forming the exterior and interior, with rubble sandwiched in between. The Santa Bárbara battery became the main battery with 37 cannon, supported by casemate guns at a lower level, and backed by a great wall with casemates at a higher level.  : 54-55, 59-61, 64-65 \\n\nThe top of the Castillo de San Felipe del Morro Lighthouse was destroyed during the 1898 bombardment of the city by the United States, and the American flag replaced the Spanish on 18 November 1898.  : 78  : 163 \\n\nHistory\nUpon the advice of Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés , a battery was constructed on the rocky promontory called \"the Morro\", when the location of La Fortaleza was deemed unsuitable. This battery consisted of a tower with 4 embrasures , and a Water Battery at the foot of the slope for 3 guns. By 1555, Morro had 8 bronze cannons, as a defense against French privateers .   \\n\nDuring the Spanish government of the island, El Morro, also known as Castillo de San Felipe, survived several attacks from foreign powers on various occasions.\\n\nIn 1593 Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names.\\n\nIn 1595, Englishman Sir Francis Drake unsuccessfully attacked San Juan with his fleet in the Battle of San Juan (1595) .\\n\nIn 1598, the English attacked again, led by George Clifford , 3rd Earl of Cumberland. Clifford succeeded because he attacked San Juan over land instead of trying to enter through the San Juan Bay. However, an epidemic of dysentery forced him to flee the island after the Battle of San Juan (1598) .\\n\nIn 1625, the Dutch , led by Boudewijn Hendricksz , also attacked the island emulating George Clifford\\'s overland invasion. To the amazement of the citizens, the invaders were able to pass in front of the castle\\'s defenders and into the harbor, out of reach of the city\\'s cannons. El Morro managed to resist the siege and eventually made the Dutch retire, although the attackers were able to sack and burn the city before leaving the Battle of San Juan (1625) .\\n\nIn 1797, British General Ralph Abercromby and Admiral Henry Harvey, with a force of 7,000-13,000 men, invaded the island of Puerto Rico. Captain General Don Ramón de Castro and his forces repelled the attack. Abercromby and Harvey were defeated in the Battle of San Juan (1797) .\\n\nEl Morro\\'s last active fight occurred during a naval bombardment by the United States Navy during the 1898 Spanish-American War , ending the age of naval warfare in the Caribbean, at least in the classical sense. During the Spanish-American War, the castle was attacked at least three times by American naval forces, the largest being the Bombardment of San Juan on May 12, 1898. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris , in which Spain ceded ownership of the islands of Puerto Rico , Cuba , Guam, and the Philippines to the United States.\\n\nEl Morro and many other Spanish government buildings in Old San Juan became part of a large U.S. Army post, called Fort Brooke . In the early 20th century, the U.S. military filled up the esplanade (the green space in front of \"El Morro\") with baseball diamonds, hospitals, officers\\' quarters, an officers\\' club and even a golf course.\\n\nOn March 21, 1915, Lt. Teófilo Marxuach was the officer of the day at the El Morro fortress. The Hamburg America Line cargo liner Odenwald tried to leave port without permission from the Customs Collector. Lt. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on her, which forced her to stop.  The shots ordered by Lt. Marxuach are widely regarded to be the first shots fired by the United States in World War I, although the first actual wartime shot fired by the US came on the day war was declared, during the scuttling of SMS Cormoran off Guam .\\n\nDuring World War II the United States Army added a massive concrete bunker to the top of El Morro to serve as a Harbor Defense Fire Control Station to direct a network of coastal artillery sites, and to keep watch for German submarines which were ravaging shipping in the Caribbean. A lighthouse, rebuilt by the U.S. Army in 1906-08 is the tallest point on El Morro, standing 180 feet (55 m) above sea level. Flagpoles on El Morro today customarily fly the United States flag , the Puerto Rican flag and the Cross of Burgundy flag, also known in Spanish as las Aspas de Borgoña, a standard which was widely used by Spanish armies around the world from 1506 to 1785.\\n\nIn 1961, the United States Army officially retired from El Morro. The fort became a part of the National Park Service to be preserved as museums. In 1983, the Castillo and the city walls were declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations . In honor of the Quincentennial of the voyages of Columbus in 1992 the exterior esplanade was cleared of palm trees that had been planted by the U.S. Army in the Fort Brooke era, and restored to the open appearance this \"field-of-fire\" for El Morro\\'s cannon would have had in colonial Spanish times. Parking lots and paved roads were also removed, and the El Morro lighthouse repaired and restored to its original appearance. The 1963 film Thunder Island featured an extensive foot chase and shootout scene filmed at El Morro. El Morro was also used as a film set in the 1996 motion picture Amistad . Steven Spielberg used it to represent a fort in Sierra Leone where African slaves were auctioned in 1839. African slave labor was used in addition to local labor to help build the castillo. El Morro was a defensive military fortification and a major component of San Juan\\'s harbor defense system. Puerto Rico as such was considered by the Spanish crown as the \"Key to the Antilles\"; no enemy ship could navigate its waters without fear of capture.\\n\nAn annual artisans festival is held at the fort every July.   \\n\nThe fort is home to a resident colony of around 200 stray cats that are believed to have been descended from cats introduced either during colonial times or in the mid-20th century as part of rat eradication programs. Following concerns over an increase in their population, in 2023 the National Park Service announced it would contract an animal welfare organization to remove the cats and threatened to hire a pest control agency if it were to fail. However, the plan was suspended following a lawsuit by animal welfare groups in 2024.  \\n\nHistorical timeline\nGallery\nSee also\nSome other forts in San Juan:\\n\n\\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCastillo Serrallés\n\\n\nCastillo Serrallés (English: Serralles Castle) is a mansion located in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico , overlooking the downtown area ( Ponce Pueblo ). It was built during the 1930s for Juan Eugenio Serrallés, son of businessman Juan Serrallés , founder of Destilería Serrallés . The structure sits on a 2.5-acre (1.0 ha) exceedingly manicured property.  Nowadays, the structure functions as a museum, Museo Castillo Serrallés , with information about the sugar cane and rum industries and its impact in the economy of Puerto Rico . It is also increasingly used as a venue for social activities, including destination weddings .  The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2001.  In 1996, the structure was featured in the American TV series America\\'s Castles .  \\n\nHistory\nThe house was purchased by the city of Ponce from the Serrallés heirs. While the castle was valued at US$17-US$25 million,  it was purchased for a mere US$400,000 and included much of the furniture in the sale.  The city\\'s initial intent was to turn it into a museum of Puerto Rican music.  The Museum of Puerto Rican Music was eventually established elsewhere in the city.\\n\nThe mansion was emptied in 1956, and while the structure kept in very good shape, the grounds were overgrown by weeds to the point that a total landscaping plan was needed to return the estate to its past glory.  In 1980, the property was still owned by Rosa Serrallés Torruella and Felix J. Serrallés Sanchez.  \\n\nLocation\nThe mansion was built on the south side of Cerro del Vigía ( Del Vigía hill), which is the most prominent and nearest hill to the Ponce Historic Zone . Its location has the mansion overlooking the city of Ponce . Cerro del Vigía is the name of one of the hills to the north of the city of Ponce that make up the foothills of the Cordillera Central found further inland.  The location of the mansion, together with its magnificent landscape, and many architectural details, have made it unique among other Puerto Rico mansions. Its location atop the Cerro del Vigía hill makes it visible from nearly every part of the city of Ponce, \"as a constant reminder to all Ponceños of their heritage\".  The building\\'s location, coupled with its \"Y\" shape form, allows for an impressive and breath-taking view of the city of Ponce from any one of its eastern, southern, or western elevations.\\n\nSignificance\nThe Serrallés mansion was built as the exclusive residence of Don Juan Eugenio Serrallés, a leader in the sugar cane industry during the early part of the 20th century. The building is significant from both the architectural and historical perspectives.\\n\nArchitecturally, the building represents an example of Spanish Moroccan architecture, the style first introduced in Puerto Rico by the architect Pedro Adolfo de Castro. Three examples of this style of architecture were: El Castillo de Valdes in Mayagüez , el Castillo de Mario Mercado Montalvo in Guayanilla , and el Castillo de Serrallés.  In the 1920s, other similar mansions were built in Puerto Rico, but Castillo Serrallés is the best preserved.  Historically, the building is a reminder of the cultural and economic changes that southern Puerto Rico experienced in the 1920s. \"Ponce\\'s dependence on the sugar cane industry at the close of the nineteenth century, created an atmosphere of development from which evolved a series of intrinsic cultural characteristics and afforded great wealth to many families involved in the industry. The wealthy families generally chose Europe as the model for the direction that cultural endeavors would take.\"  \\n\nAccording to the Puerto Rico State Historic Preservation Office, \"European fashions and lifestyles were usually preferred in this part of the Island...The result of [the] intense cultural interest [of the time] provided work for artists, artisans, and architects whose creations tended to strengthen the image of the ethnic identity...Even though El Castillo Serralles is not based on an indigenous design, its architectural significance lies in the fact that it was designed to adapt well with Caribbean climatic conditions. Its workmanship, its interior decorations, its furniture, and even its floor plan, reflect the cultural attitudes of the times\".  \\n\nPhysical characteristics\nThe castle was built in 1930 by local architect Pedro Adolfo de Castro y Besosa.  \\nIt includes two huge terraces , an outside fountain, and a symmetrical backyard garden. Its interior includes a luxurious hall, a spacious dining room, and an interior courtyard .  \\n\nThe house has four floors. The ground floor houses the garage and a basement used as service quarters. The second floor contains the library, a central patio, a solarium , the living room, dining room, and the kitchen. The third floor contains all the sleeping quarters. The fourth floor is the terrace, from where the most impressive and commanding views of the city are possible. Intended as a relaxed entertainment space, the terrace has both covered and uncovered areas. Its flooring is all tiled. [ citation needed ] \\n\nAccess to the main entrance to the house from the front street, and leading to the second level of the north elevation, is by way of either of two semi-circular stairways which run from the covered carriage entrance on the ground level of the north elevation.  This leads to double French doors which open into a large vestibule reception area with a ceramic tile floor. The view from this room reveals an open courtyard patio with a fountain.  The formal living room is located to the left of the vestibule. The living room is the only room with a parquet floor.  \\n\nThe building was constructed entirely of concrete.  The mansion was designed in a style popular in the 1920s for representing Spanish Mediterranean influence. Prominent throughout the building is the use of wooden round arches over the building\\'s large windows and doorways, many of them adorned with small stained glass panes. Some openings are also decorated in ornate iron work. The two towers that accentuate the building\\'s eastern and western sides have red roof tiles.  This accent is also present on all other rooftops. The exterior of the buildings is finished in stucco .

        "page_content": "Contents\nCatedral de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe\n\\n\nThe Catedral de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (English: Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe or simply Ponce Cathedral ) is the cathedral for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ponce located in downtown Ponce , Puerto Rico . The cathedral lies in the middle of Ponce\\'s town square , known as Plaza Las Delicias , located at the center of the Ponce Historic Zone . For its historic significance, the cathedral was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  It is the seat of the Bishop of Ponce, currently Rubén González Medina .   \\n\nThe cathedral has a history that dates to 1670. It has been damaged several times by fires and earthquakes. It stands out among Puerto Rico\\'s other four cathedrals for its intricate design. It has a large pipe organ that was played by danza master and composer Juan Morel Campos . Architecturally, it is designed in the neoclassical style. Structurally, it follows a cruciform plan, with a large dome at the crossing . The interior consists of a main nave and two large aisles separated by a series of eight arcades. There are two small chapels in its interior.  Two three-story square towers decorate the front facade. [ citation needed ] \\n\nHistory\nThe cathedral has over 300 years of history. In 1670, a small chapel was built in the center of the colonial settlement of Ponce on the site of the present cathedral.  On 17 September 1692, the King of Spain, Carlos II , issued a Cédula Real (Royal Permit) designating the chapel as a parish church .  In 1835, the original parish church was demolished to build a larger church, which was completed and opened for worship in 1839.  Among its new features were two octagonal towers on the corners of the front facade .  The original (pre-1918) towers were also three stories high and had windows on each of the sides. They were each topped with a Christian cross.\\n\nThe cathedral contains a number of burials within its interior.    It was among the first burial places in Ponce. However, in 1814 the practice was discontinued due to potential health risks on church worshipers, and based on the edict promulgated in 1784 by King Charles III . On that year the first cemetery in the city located outside a religious structure was built at the block bounded by today\\'s Calle Victoria, Union, Vives and Mendez Vigo. That block is now (2019) occupied by the Terminal de Transportación Pública Carlos Garay .  \\n\nThe building was damaged by several fires and earthquakes during the 19th and 20th centuries including the 1918 San Fermín earthquake , which caused extensive damage, including the destruction of both of the original towers.  Despite this, the 1839 building forms the core of the present building, which Pope Pius XI declared a cathedral in 1924. The cathedral\\'s first bishop was Edwin Byrne , who took charge in 1925.  \\n\nFrom 1931 to 1937, the church was reconstructed to a design by architect Francisco Porrata Doria .  The current facade bears a French neoclassical style. Among these improvements were the addition of two new chapels, a new roof, the remodelling of the upper storey of the facade and the construction of two new, richly decorated square towers. A pipe organ was installed in 1934 and re-inaugurated in 1989 after a nine-year restoration.  The building was dedicated by Bishop James E. McManus on 11 April 1950.  \\n\nLocation\nThe cathedral sits in the center of Ponce\\'s central square, Plaza Las Delicias , oriented east-to-west, with its front entrance facing west. Immediately behind the cathedral, to the east, is the historic fire house , Parque de Bombas . The two buildings effectively divide Plaza Las Delicias into two smaller plazas, named Plaza Muñoz Rivera and Plaza Degetau . Low undulating walls line the cathedral\\'s northern and southern sides, and serve to separate it from the Plazas.  Plaza Las Delicias is in barrio Segundo , one of the six core barrios of Ponce that compose Historic Zone designated by the Government of Puerto Rico to preserve the colonial character of the city.   \\n\nThe building\nThe building\\'s exterior architecture is Neoclassical , while its interior is mostly colonial and Gothic .  The current structure is larger than the 1839 structure, having been extended on the south side in 1911 with the addition of the side chapel. It covers an area of 3,540 square yards (2,960 m 2 ).  The architecture of the cathedral is neoclassical in style with the exterior painted pale blue and gray and the interior in blue and beige.  The building has many stained glass windows depicting religious scenes and two bell towers.  \\n\nThe footprint of the cathedral is of a cruciform plan. It features a large dome at the crossing of the transept and the nave . The interior consists of eight bays plus the apse .  The westernmost bay accommodates the vestibule . Above this vestibule is a second level choir loft , accessible via a wooden stairway connected to the front wall. A large pipe organ, said to have been played by Juan Morel Campos every Sunday for many years, is also on this second level loft.  The cathedral measures 42.2m long by 19.4m wide.  \\n\nArcades of semi-circular arches divide the nave from the aisles . On the south side of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral\\'s main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel.  The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain , was donated by the local Ferre family.   Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral\\'s floor is of gray and white marble design.  \\n\nThe western front facade is flanked by two square towers. They are both three stories high topped with silver domes and a Christian cross on top of these. Both towers have windows at each level. Access to the towers is through either of two small wooden doors located in the interior northwest and southwest corners of the church vestibule.  \\n\nEntry to the cathedral is through a tall pair of wooden doors in a style reminiscent of church doors of Middle Ages Europe. There are two round columns to each side of these doors, as well as rectangular wooden windows to both sides.  Atop the second level of the front facade there is a large triangular pediment , and on top of this pediment sits a Christian cross considerably larger than the two atop the tower domes. There are also two statues standing at each of the two lower ends of the large triangular pediment. Except for the wooden windows and doors, all elements on the front facade are of masonry construction.  \\n\nEvents\nOn 12 December, the cathedral hosts the annual event known as \" Las Mañanitas \", named after the Mexican birthday song (English: \"Early Mornings\"), which is sung during a pre-dawn religious procession in the downtown area to celebrate the day of the Virgin of Guadalupe , the patron saint of Ponce. The event started in 1965.  After the procession candle bearers attend Holy Mass at the Cathedral at 5:00 am. Up to 10,000 people attend the event.  On 24 December there is also a midnight Mass known as Misa de Gallo (English: Rooster\\'s Mass). [ citation needed ] \\n\nHours\nExcept for the Las Mañanitas event , the cathedral is open Monday through Friday from 6:00 am to 12:30 pm, and Saturday and Sunday from 6:00 am to 12:00 pm and from 3:00 pm to 8:00 pm.  \\n\nDamage\nThe building was damaged and temporarily closed as a result the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes .   \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

It can be accessed from and is located at the intersection of PR-165 and PR-888 .\\n\nHistory\nFounded in Cuba in 1862 and family-owned for eight generations, Bacardi Limited employs more than 7,000 people with sales in approximately 170 countries. Bacardi Limited refers to the Bacardi group of companies, including Bacardi International Limited.   \\n\nRegistered in Puerto Rico in 1909, it was not until January 1, 1937, when the first batch of Bacardi rum was produced in Cataño, Puerto Rico. In 1958, Bacardí purchased 138 acres of land in Cataño (a suburb of San Juan ) and then governor Luis Muñoz Marín called it the \"Cathedral of Rum\".  \\n\nThe Bacardi Corporation in Cataño supplies the largest quantity of rum consumed in the world  and is the private company that most contributes to the public treasury of Puerto Rico . \\n\nThe Bacardi Distillery was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 6, 2010, based on two criteria: (criteria A) the distillery\\'s enormous contribution to the economic development of Puerto Rico since its establishment and (criteria C) its designers included W. Donald Christie, Henry Klumb , Héctor Varela, and Enrique Gutiérrez. The builders included José Benítez Gutiérrez, Ramón M. Benítez, Ignacio Martín, and SAG MAC.  \\n\nThere is a family museum at the complex and in 2012, the Bacardi family celebrated 150 years in business and gathered at the complex in Cataño. A bust of its founder, Facundo Bacardi Masso was unveiled.  Then Governor Luis Fortuño also declared a new holiday called Bacardi Day, to be celebrated on February 4, in honor of the company\\'s important ties to Puerto Rico and its economy.  \\n\nThe Bacardi complex is the second most visited tourist attraction in Puerto Rico.  At the complex, tourists can go on a historical tour, a rum tasting tour and learn how to mix Bacardi rum drinks.  \\n\nAfter Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, the distillery was soon able to provide clean drinking water to residents.  \\n\nBuildings\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCaño Tiburones\nCaño Tiburones is a wetland and nature reserve located in the northern coast of Puerto Rico in the municipalities of Arecibo and Barceloneta . This is one of the largest wetlands in Puerto Rico, covering almost 7,000 acres. A large portion of the swamp, located in Arecibo, is protected as the Caño Tiburones Nature Reserve .  \\n\nGeography\nThe average annual temperature is of 80\\xcb\\x9aF (26.9\\xcb\\x9aC). Precipitation varies from 1,000 to 2,000 mm of average annual rain; it is rainiest during the wet season, from May to September.  \\n\nThe swamp is located north of the Northern Karst zone of Puerto Rico and lies above a wide limestone area. Most of the terrain in the area consists of swamp deposits made of clay and silt with smaller quantities of sand and peat . Most of the soil is hydric and organic with high acidity and poor drainage which sustains the swampy terrain.  \\n\nThe factors that contribute to the flooding characteristics of the wetlands are the number of fresh water springs located in the southern portion of the wetlands, the salt water springs to the north and the number of rivers that flow into the area, some of which are Puerto Rico\\'s longest and most torrential rivers, such as the Arecibo and Manatí rivers. Runoff flows from these rivers are integral in the formation of this wetland.  The karst zone is important for the sustainability of the wetlands since it is favorable for the flow of rivers which feed the marshy areas along the northern coast of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nHistory\nThe nature reserve was established in 1998 with the purpose of preserving the ecological integrity of the swamp.  The reserve is managed jointly by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA) and the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture . \\n\nEcology\nThe flora found in the swamp is typical of that found in wetlands and most species are hydrophytes, which are aquatic or semiaquatic plants that require flooded conditions to survive. Some of the most common plants in the swamp are the southern cattail ( Typha dominguensis ), aquatic ferns such as mangrove fern ( Acrosticum aureum ), Paspalum , and mangrove .  \\n\nThe area around the reserve is considered important for wildlife, including migratory species. The area is also an important nesting area for numerous fish species. The wetlands are home to 206 bird species, more than 25 insect species, 6 reptile species, 9 crustacean species and more than 20 species of fish. The Puerto Rican boa ( Epicrates inornatus ) can also be found in the region.  The swamp was formerly an important site for the Caribbean flamingo ( Phoenicopterus ruber ) and flamingo sightings can be considered as a good sign of the ecological revitalization and recovery of the area.  \\n\nRecreation\nThe recreational infrastructure in the wetlands are limited but there are opportunities for ecotourism (kayak tours are offered), birdwatching and fishing.  \\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCementerio Católico San Vicente de Paul\n\\n\nThe Cementerio Católico San Vicente de Paul (English: Saint Vincent de Paul Catholic Cemetery ) is a cemetery in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico . It is the only cemetery in Puerto Rico with a group of niches built forming a basement, in which the burials occurred beneath ground level, thus giving the effect of a catacomb .  The cemetery is named after Vincent de Paul (24 April 1581 - 27 September 1660), the French Roman Catholic priest who dedicated his life to serving the poor. It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  \\n\nLocation\nCementerio Catolico San Vicente de Paul is located off Puerto Rico Route PR-123 in barrio Magueyes Urbano . PR-123 used to be signed PR-10 , and this last route numbering might still be seen in some older documents about this cemetery. The cemetery is located on a site with a steep terrain gradient .\\n\nHistory\nDuring the turn of the 20th century the priests of San Vicente de Paul built a private Catholic cemetery in Ponce. The site was blessed on 15 August 1901  and opened to the public. The wealthy families of the area bought plots for $60 and began to develop the cemetery with magnificent graves and mausoleums .  Today (February 2016), the cemetery is \"squeezed\" between sprawling urban residential developments that now fully surround it.\\n\nBackground and significance\nPonce, located in the south coast of Puerto Rico, was one of the wealthiest settlements of the island at the turn of the 20th century. Given the status of area cemeteries at the time, the Catholic cemetery offered an exclusive precinct in which the rich could bury their dead. For this reason almost all the tombs are magnificent in their design, ornamentation, and construction. Some of the best examples of funerary architecture in Puerto Rico of the early 20th century period can be seen in this cemetery. Marble sculptures from Italy , Spain and other parts of Europe adorn many of the tombs. Most tombs are covered with Ponce\\'s ubiquitous stylish pink marble as well.  \\n\nThe larger mausolea, which belong to the wealthiest families of southern Puerto Rico, are magnificent examples of monumental funerary architecture of the period. Some of the best examples are the mausoleums of the Serralles , Mercado , Toro , and Valdivieso families.  \\n\nThe cemetery is unique among others in Puerto Rico: \"A unique feature of the cemetery is a group of niches that were built forming a basement, in which the burials occurred beneath ground level, thus giving the effect of a catacomb \".  \\n\nDesign\nThe cemetery has a simple entrance gate. It consists of an iron gate flanked by two masonry pilasters . Although Catholic , this cemetery never had a chapel by the entrance, or anywhere in the entire precinct.  \\n\nThe layout of the cemetery was done following the Spanish tradition of having two main axes forming a cross. The rest of the precinct \\'s layout was done in a square grid fashion. The cemetery follows the contour lines of the steep site it is located on. As a results, some of the approach paths were built as stairs.  \\n\nThe main axis culminates with the pantheon for the priests of the Paul order . \"In this truly monumental tomb, sculptural forms are integral part of architecture. An interesting feature in this design with double function is the baldachino , which protects not only the altar, but also the tomb. The baroque style of this structure can be appreciated in the free use of forms, its large scale and sweeping vistas, and the complexity of its composition.\"  \\n\nThe cemetery has a clear arrangement of larger tombs placed along the major central and secondary axes. The other graves then radiate from there. Many of these larger tombs are mausoleums in different architectural styles ranging from the classical revival to the art-deco .  \\n\nArchitecture\nThe style of the cemetery is characterized more by its architectural than by its sculptural features.   : 65 The quality of the construction is such that \"it is considered the posthumous mansion\" of those buried there.  : 117 A considerable number of the mausoleum in this cemetery are made of marble, a testimony to the wealth of those interred there.  : 210 \\n\nOf special significance for their architectural value are the Serralles family mausoleum composed of a central chapel raised over a raised plaza, the Mario Mercado Montalvo family mausoleum also over a raised plaza, and the Valdivieso family mausoleum. The Toro family mausoleum also presents a funerary chapel but it is not raised over a plaza nor is the Chardon family mausoleum.  \\n\nRecent developments\nMany of these magnificent tombs have been abandoned after their owners moved corpses of their dead to the Cementerio Civil de Ponce . This was due in part to the high cost of maintenance and the strict regulations set by the administration. Under no condition would they allow a non-Catholic to be buried there. Some families did not want to be separated by this rule and moved their loved ones to the Cementerio Civil. As a result, some graves have been abandoned and cannot be sold by the cemetery administration since they are private property and have a legal, albeit uninterested, owner.  \\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

The center is currently accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and it publishes La Revista del Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe .   \\n\nHistory\nIt was incorporated on February 28, 1968, by Pablo Casals , Luis Muñoz Marín , Roberto Busó Carrasquillo, and Jaime Benítez . However, it remained inactive and without organization until 1976, when Ricardo Alegría made a request before the Council on Higher Education of Puerto Rico to transform the center into an academic institution.  \\n\nWith the CEAPRC, Alegría intended for a small institution that possessed an intimate environment, with intellectual growth and the promotion of a region-wide Caribbean emphasis as its focus.  In her 2002 book, Carmen Dolores Hernández credited the CEAPRC (which she labels an \"experimental\" institution \"unparalleled in the island or the Antilles\") with breaking away from the \"cultural euro centrism\" of higher education in Puerto Rico.  The curriculum was intended to be different from that of the universities.  Puerto Rico and the Antilles received a central role with historic archeology, local literature and history in the spotlight. Besides numerous local sites, archeological digs were also held by students in the Dominican Republic and Cuba. Foreign professors such as Irving Rouse, Peter Roe, Mario Veloz Maggiolo, Sally Price and Lourdes Domínguez also collaborated with the CEAPRC. Students were allowed to take courses from other universities.  On at least one occasion, a course was added due to student initiative.\\n\nThe institution has had collaboration agreements with Universidad San Carlos (Guatemala), Universidad Autónoma (Dominican Republic, which included joint work with professors José Alcántara Almánzar, Pedro Vergés, Carlos Andújar and Marcio Veloz Maggiolo) and Universidad de Veracruz (Mexico).  The classes of Puerto Rican Literature and History, Puerto Rican Society, Puerto Rican the Caribbean during the XX Century and Puerto Rican Culture were mandatory, while several electives involving literature, cinema, racial studies, law, Arts and other practices were offered.  \\nThe CEAPRC\\'s faculty worked on a contractual basis, allowing a revolving door of professors to come and go.  During its early years it grew to include figures like Arturo Morales Carrión, José Arsenio Torres, Juan Rodríguez Cruz, Eugenio Fernández Méndez, Luis Díaz Soler, José Ramón de la Torre, María Teresa Babín, Carmelo Rosario Natal, Carmen M. Ramos de Santiago, Francisco López Cruz, Lidio Cruz Monclova, Andrés Sánchez Tarniella, Ernesto Jaime Ruíz de la Mata\\xe2\\x80\\x94a member of the short-lived surrealist group El Mirador Azul , Edgar Martínez Masdeu, Gervasio García, Arturo Santana, Héctor Campos Parsi,  Luis Nieves Falcón and Esther Melón.  Local figures such as Mela Pons (Alegría\\'s wife) and Juan Antonio Corretjer, were involved in hosting conferences.  Alegría himself taught the Culture of Puerto Rico course for decades. His work with the CEAPRC reached foreign academics such as \\xc3\\x81ngel Rama, who on August 10, 1983, noted in a letter that it had been a topic of discussion in a reunion held between him and Maldonado Denia at Paris.  During Alegría\\'s tenure as director, the institution had an \"open doors\" policy.  Among those that the CEAPRC has hosted is a chief of the Soshone tribe.  \\n\nCollaboration with foreign institutions brought the likes of Irving Rouse (Yale), Douglas Newton (Metropolitan Museum), Gordon Willey (Harvard), Jean-Batiste Romain (State University of Haiti), George Kubler (Yale), Nina S. de Friedman (Instituto de Antropología de Colombia), Eduardo Arcila Farías (Colegio de México), William Bascom (University of California), Manuel Moreno Fraginals (Universidad de la Havana), Wande Abimbola (University of Ife), Carlos Rama (Universidad de Barcelona) and Manuel García Arévalo (Universidad Nacional de Santo Domingo).   Since then, \\xc3\\x81ngel López Cantós, Antonio Lorente, Pedro Vergés, Lourdes Domínguez, Lorenzo Rubio, Jesús Urrea, Juan Tena Ibarra, Demetrio Ramos, Jorge Febles and Lucio Mijares Pérez, among others have served as invited professors.  \\n\nThe CEAPRC created the slideshows El arte de los aborígenes de Puerto Rico , Las Artes populares de Puerto Rico , La catedral de San Juan , La Capilla del Santo Cristo de la Salud , La Iglesia de San José , El pintor José Campeche and El pintor Francisco Oller Cestero and the short films La vida de Cristo según el santero Florencio Cabán (directed by Amílcar Tirado, winner of the 1979 Golden Eagle Award of the Non-Theatrical Event Council , Don Tomás, el alfarero de Las Piedras , Juan Alindato y las máscaras de Ponce , Las tejedoras de sombreros de paja de Cabo Rojo , Cuando llegaron los indios de Boriquen , La cestería en Puerto Rico , El Gagá de Similá , Vudú en la República Dominicana , Serie de Maestros Artesanos (José Arsenio Torres) are also part of its collection.  All mentions of the Antillean natives by foreign historians were compiled, taking 25 years to complete in the Crónicas de los indios de las Antillas .  \\nDuring the 1976-80 years the ICP grew politicized, while the CEAPRC focused on Puerto Rican culture.  In 1978, the CEAC entered alliances with Temple University and the Universidad de Valladolid.  \\n\nIn 1981, Alegría proposed the creation of a student magazine, Caribe , published on a biannual basis.  That same year, the Catholic Church sponsored a course about its history at Puerto Rico, Cátedra Juan Alejo Arizmendi.  In 1982, Alegría established an exchange collaboration involving the Academia de Ciencias of Cuba.  Since the CEAPRC had its own editorial, it published the work of figures like Arturo Morales Carrión, some of the master\\'s thesis and historic documents.  Through it Alegría  published La vida de Jesucristo según el santero puertorriqueño Florencio Cabán and Primeras representaciones gráficas del indio americano (1493-1523) .  Other publications include Osiris Delgado\\'s El pintor Francisco Oller y Cestero , Félix Ojeda Reyes\\' La manigua en París: correspondencia diplomática de Ramón E. Betances and Flor Piñero de Rivera\\'s Arturo Schomburg: un puertorriqueño descubre el legado histórico del negro .\\n\nThe loan of Casa Blanca by the ICP was of only $1 per year.  As the agreement was about to end, rumors circled that the Romero Barceló administration intended to close down the CEAPRC, opposing the frequent presence of political opponents within the premises.  The institution had already face budge cuts when the new administration of the ICP objected to give it $6,000 from the Fundación Nacional de las Artes.  Alegría, however, warned Rafael Rivera García of the Office of Cultural Affairs that he would have to be ousted from Casa Blanca by the police, but ultimately decided to move  after new ICP director Leticia del Rosario intended to raise the loan to recover the $6,000. Having participated in the restoration of the San José Church since 1977, Alegría negotiated the abandoned Seminario Conciliar building for the CEAPRC from cardinal Luis Aponte Martínez, offering to restore it as well (in exchange, the institution didn\\'t have to pay loan for some years, the specific quantity later being revised by a Church appraiser).  The estimate of the project was $4,000,000 but Alegría recycled materials from other sources and completed it for $600,000.  After the process was completed in November 1986, the CEAPRC moved to the building. The CEAPRC also received donations from citizens for particular uses.  \\n\nIn 1982, it received recognition by the Middle States Association, which was suspicious about the $650 salary that the director (Alegría) was receiving since it was improbable that his successor would agree to that sum.  Despite this, Alegría considered the intervention of the federal entity counterintuitive given the topic of study, but allowed it so that the students could receive additional benefits.  The restoration of the Seminario Conciliar began in 1984.  After moving to its new base, the Aula Magna was used for cultural activities.  A program of public conferences on Puerto Rican and Caribbean topics that was opened also held its events there.  The old refectory was also converted into an exhibition room.  The classrooms were named after figures like Eugenio María de Hostos , Roman Baldorioty de Castro , José Campeche, José Julián Acosta and Alejandro Tapia.  In 1985, Alegría began publishing La Revista del Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe , emphasizing an academic approach.  The CEAPRC also produced slideshows in collaboration with the Fundación Puertorriqueña de las Humanidades for educational use.  By the early 2000s, nine documentaries had been completed.\\nA Middle States evaluation team reviewed the status in 1987, considering the CEAPRC an \"institution with [...] a well-defined view of itself\" when comparing it to other Universities and colleges.  In July 1987, the CEAC collaborated with the Puerto Rican Cultural Heritage House of New York in a course offered from teachers from the diaspora.  When interviewed Alegría considered his work at the CEAPRC a continuation of his previous work at the ICP, intending to create the professionals that were needed in the kind of projects that were undertaken there.  \\n\nIn May 1987, a restored chapel was inaugurated within the premises of the CEAPRC.  In 1989, Alegría loaned several pieces of his collection for an Antillean masks exhibit.  In 1990 Arturo Schomburg and Casa de las Américas exhibits were organized.  In 1991, the institution began offering its first doctorate degree.  Exhibitions on the archeological work of Miguel Rodríguez and Cuban slavery was also hosted.  In 1992, Puerto Rican engravings and several books from the Guillermo Esteves Volckers collection on the topic of Christopher Columbus were exhibited.  The Museo de las Américas, inaugurated during this year, was viewed by Alegría as the culmination of his life\\'s work, bringing together several past initiatives.  In 1993, the XV International Archeology Congress was held at Puerto Rico.  Exhibits on Caribbean archeology and local academic magazines were also held.  \\n\nIn June 1993, budget cuts by the Pedro Rosselló administration ended a yearly legislative donation of $100,000 when the House of Representatives eliminated it after Carlos Juan López Nieves criticized that Alegría was personally involved with the CEAPRC and it had \"become [his] business\".  The director didn\\'t take the claims lightly. The following month, the Senate of Puerto Rico restored $63,000 of the total sum. In 1994, exhibits were held on the topics of Pablo de la Torriente Brau and Puerto Rican children\\'s literature.  In 1995, the CEAPRC entered a collaboration with the Universidad de Sevilla to offer a joint doctorate in American History.  In 1996, Alegría and Pons loaned several pieces from their Talla de Santos woodwork collection to the Museo de las Américas, as part of the institutions second permanent exhibit.  Between 1997 and 1998, the municipalities of Caguas and San Juan offered grants to students.  On the 100th anniversary of the Spanish-American War , an exhibit on life before 1898 was held.  In 1997, the government eliminated the recurrent UPR donation to the CEAPRC.  The following year, the UPR made additional cuts in the collaboration for publications, investigations and visiting professors. In response, Alegría auctioned pieces from his private collection to gather funds, gathering $40,000. In 1999, students from the CEAPRC participated in excavations at Havana.  \\n\nEntering the new millennium, efforts were made to establish more links with the Dominican Republic and Cuba in the form of exchange programs.  For Alegría, this was a cultural response to the concept of an Antillean Confederation. By this time, the CEAPRC\\'s library had grown to include 14,000 books and hosted the Guillermo Esteves Volckers, Rosa Estades and Monelisa Pérez Marchand collections, as well as audiovisual content and documentation.  Some effort to modernize the institution\\'s classic work took place with the digitalization of the he Crónicas de los indios de las Antillas initiative.  \\n\nAlegría left his role in the CEAPRC in 2001, being replaced by Juan Manuel González Lamela as director and Juan Rodríguez Cancel as Dean of Academic Affairs.  The institution had an endowment  fund of $2,250,000 at the moment.  By this time, figures like Juan Manuel García Passalaqua, Enrique Laguerre, Luis De la Rosa, Guillermo Baralt, Blanca Silvestrini, José Ferrer Canales, Ana Sagardía, Federico Acevedo, Ramón Luis Acevedo, Carmen Isabel Raffuci, Antonio J. González and Silvia \\xc3\\x81lvarez Curbelo had served as professors in the CEAPRC.  In April 2001, the government promised an improvement of $100,000 in the assignment to the institution to commemorate Alegría\\'s 80th birthday.  The institution was one of 30 that joined in the celebrations surrounding this commemoration.  \\n\nNotable members\nNotable alumni\nReferences\nFootnotes \\n\nBibliography \\n\nExternal links\n18°28\\xe2\\x80\\xb200\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°07\\xe2\\x80\\xb208\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.466702°N 66.118767°W ﻿ / 18.466702; -66.118767 \\n"

Following the acquisition of Puerto Rico by the U.S. government in 1898, as a colonial consequence of the Spanish-American War , the town was originally built as a company town by Ford & Co. (no relation to the automobile manufacturer), an American investment firm that developed a sugar cane manufacturing and export business, and its accompanying employee town facilities.\\n\nIt included 317 contributing buildings , 17 contributing structures , and seven contributing sites on 326 acres (1.32 km 2 ).     The sugar mill town and its facilities were constructed into separate living areas for white Americans, the American Zone, and those for Puerto Rican employees, The Puerto Rican Zone. On December 26, 1934, a series of protracted labor strikes began against the structured racial segregation and subsistent wages of the sugar cane industry, locally, and across Puerto Rico. The international price of sugar declined over the course of the 20th century, and by the 1960s, the company abandoned the town. At the time, its operation was taken over by local and national government, but with the continued decline of the international sugar price, the factory and its facilities were permanently closed in 1993.\\n\nIn 2020, American Express awarded funds for the restoration of the Central Aguirre Historic District.

        "page_content": "Contents\nCentral Cortada\nCentral Cortada , also known as the Cortada Sugarcane Refinery , was a sugarcane plantation and refinery located in Descalabrado , Santa Isabel , Puerto Rico . The area where the refinery is located has been used for the growth and processing of sugarcane since the 18th century.  \\n\nHistory\nThe area where Central Cortada is located was originally called Estancia Descalabrado , owned by Catalan settlers named Juan de Quintana (from 1737 to 1789) and later Juan Cortada Manzo (from 1800 to 1865), who build the trapiche . The Cortada family kept operating the farm as part of their crop financing business, the Ponce -based Cortada & Cia . This company kept growing and acquiring new haciendas in the area, such as Hacienda Palmarito in 1868. The cholera epidemic of 1855-1856, which killed many estancia slaves, and the abolition of slavery in 1873 drastically transformed Puerto Rico\\'s economy and impacted the sugarcane industry at the time. This period lasted through the Spanish-American War until the First World War .  \\n\nThe Santa Isabel Sugar Company was founded in 1918 to build the infrastructure necessary to modernize and develop the sugarcane industry in the former estancia . This company was founded in 1918 and was owned by the Cortada family and shareholders J. C. Mc Cormick Hartman, Hugh Guillén, Isidro Abarca, Antonio \\xc3\\x81lvarez, Francisco Verges, George T. Parker, Leopoldo Cabassa, Antonio Alcaide, and Rafael Fabián. The director was Juan Cortada Tirado. Most of the sugarcane workers at this time were poor peasants who would come from the mountainous areas in search of work and alternative employment. These workers would often be called colonos ( Spanish for \"colonists\") as the former slave-operated estancias and the communities that grew around them were now referred to as colonias or \"colonies\".\\n\nIn the 1930s, the refinery was sold to the Central Aguirre Sugar Company , which operated the Central Aguirre refinery in Guayama . The refinery ceased operations in 1940 and due to grinding restrictions it remained closed throughout the Second World War . It opened again in 1944, and continued to operate until the 1970s. In 1970 it produced 16,968 tons of sugar, and it remained operational until 1974.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nTibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center\n\\n\nThe Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center  in Sector La Vega de Taní,  Barrio Tibes , Ponce , Puerto Rico , houses one of the most important archaeological discoveries made in the Antilles . The discovery provides an insight as to how the indigenous tribes of the Igneri and Taínos lived and played during and before the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the New World. Tibes is the oldest Antillean Indian ceremonial and sports complex yet uncovered in Puerto Rico. Within its boundaries is also the largest indigenous cemetery discovered to date - consisting of 186 human skeletons, most from the Igneri and the rest from the pre-Taíno cultures.  Based on the orientation of the ceremonial plazas, this is also believed to be the oldest astronomical observatory in the Antilles.  The museum was established in 1982 and restored in 1991.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is one of the largest and most significant indigenous sites in the Caribbean islands, and is the largest ceremonial site in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nThe continuous occupation from Igneri to Taíno times, the presence of the large stone constructions, the presence of shell middens and stratified deposits, all afford an opportunity to investigate some of the major substantive and theoretical problems in Caribbean archeology. Besides lending itself to the traditional problems of culture, history and chronology, the site provides the ideal setting for the study of the cultural processes responsible for the transition from Igneri to Taíno cultural manifestation. There has been some controversy in the literature as to whether there was a direct unilinear, in situ , transition from one to the other or whether the two manifestations actually represent two different groups. The data at this site can contribute significantly to the resolution of this research problem, as well as to other basic questions pertaining to the changes in sociopolitical organization which may have gone along with the changes evidenced in the material culture.  \\n\nThe site also lends itself to the study of problems relating to extra-Antillean influences on the Caribbean. The evidence from the site indicates that possible influences from Mesoamerica , e.g. the ball game, are in evidence in Puerto Rico as early as 700 A.D. The presence of shell middens and refuse heaps at the site will afford an opportunity to study subsistence patterns as well as possibly some information on the paleo-environment. The burials and associated grave goods will provide an insight into social, religious, ceremonial/symbolic systems of these occupants, as well as provide information on prehistoric demographic patterns, nutrition, disease and other prehistoric population characteristics.  \\n\nOver 186 human remains were found within the boundaries of the ceremonial center, in what is considered to be the largest indigenous cemetery in the region.  Most of the remains were from the Igneri Culture and DNA samples have been taken from the remains for further studies. Information such as the ceremonies, eating habits, ceramic styles and much more has been provided from these remains and from the excavations.  \\n\nThe site is now a tourist attraction which was opened to the public on 30 April 1982.  Artifacts found on the site are on display and can be seen in a museum on the site and at the Ponce Museum of Art .\\n\nIt was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 14 April 1978 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones on May 16, 2001.  It is known as the Centro Ceremonial Indígena de Tibes .\\n\nPhysical appearance\nThe Centro Ceremonial Indigena at Tibes, Ponce, Puerto Rico, was discovered during the days after heavy rain downpours. The survey was conducted by the Sociedad Guaynia de Arqueologia e Historia and was sponsored by the Puerto Rico Institute of Culture . Clearing the area\\'s high brush revealed a number of shell middens, as well as the major features of the site which were the carefully laid out stone constructions traditionally referred to as ball courts.  \\n\nA total of seven ball courts and a quadrangular plaza are distributed throughout the site. Five of the ball courts are rectangular, consisting of two parallel lines of flat stones and open at both ends. The remaining two ball courts are U-shaped, bounded on each side by a walk paved with flat river cobbles and boulders . Another major feature of the site is a series of triangular stone arrangements surrounding a flat excavated area.  \\n\nThe main feature of the site is the nearly quadrangular enclosure which has been called a plaza. It is bounded on two sides by a walk paved with flat stones while the other two sides are defined with flat slabs. Many of the stones surrounding the plaza bear petroglyphs . The terrain within the ball courts and plaza have been artificially modified. Several shell middens are scattered irregularly throughout the site and is some instances the ball courts intrude into them, indicating that the site was occupied for an extended period of time with a gradual evolution into a ceremonial center.  \\n\nA number of test pits have been excavated to establish an absolute and relative chronology as well as to define the potential for the site. These indicate that the site was originally occupied by the earliest agricultural immigrants into the greater Antilles , the Igneri. Radiocarbon dates and pottery analyses have revealed a continuous period of occupation between 400 AD and 1000 AD The last inhabitants of the site were presumably the Taínos.  \\n\nPre-Columbian era\nThe Taínos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493, played a series of games which were both ceremonial and recreational, such as races, contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the gladiators ) and ball playing.  \\n\nAccording to the eyewitness account of Spanish historian Pedro Martir de Angleria, the body strength games were played in front of the whole village in the presence of the \"Cacique\" (Chief) and in some occasions an invited guest. Two teams would fight with bows and arrows in defense of their possessions as if they were enemies. In one of the events, witnessed by Angleria, four men died and many others were injured in the space of one hour. The contest would come to an end only if the Cacique gave the ending signal.  \\n\nThe ball game, called \"Batey\", was played in the ceremonial ball court, which they also called a \" Batey \", situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a \"U\". The ball was called Batu and made of rubber and vegetable leaves, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. One team to the west and the other to the east. The fathers and sons played on the opposite teams. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain number of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed.  The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas the game was played in the following manner: \"One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. Play continued from side to side until an error was made.  \\n\nDiscovery\nThe site was discovered in 1975 in the aftermath of Hurricane Eloise .  In that year, archaeologists from the Guaynia Society of Archaeology and History at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Puerto Rico , members of the Archaeological Society of the Southwest, announced the discovery of the ruins of a \"Batey\" in barrio Tibes , on the northern outskirts of the city of Ponce . A total of 9 ball fields were discovered buried under thick forest overgrowth, dating back to AD 25 in the area which is now known as \"Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes\" (The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center). The fields varied in size from 12.8 meters (42 ft) long by 10.9 meters (35.8 ft) wide to 35.1 meters (115 ft) long by 9.3 meters (30.5 ft) wide.   \\n\nEarly inhabitants\nAccording to archeologists, the ball parks and ceremonial centers were built by the Igneri Culture, a Pre-Taíno tribe which inhabited the island. Modern technology tells us that the area was populated in 25 AD and that the Igneri abandoned the area in 600 AD for some unknown reason or reasons. The Taínos populated the same area in 1000 AD.  \\n\nAccording to archaeologist Osvaldo Garcia Goyco, there is evidence that some of the plazas are oriented in relation to the equinox and solstices of the four seasons of the year. This is not unusual since the Taínos cultivated their crops in accordance to their astrological observations. The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is the oldest astronomical observatory in the Caribbean.   \\n\nThe Taínos had their own culture, customs and governing structure. Besides using the fields for ball playing, they would also use the plazas to celebrate the \" Areyto \" which was a celebration consisting of telling an oral history told by singing and dancing accompanied by music. Most of the knowledge and information that we have about the traditions of the Taínos came about the personal observations and historical documentations of Fray Bartolomé de las Casas. Fray Bartolomé de las Casas described an \"Areyto\" in the following manner: \"And on this island what I could understand was that their songs which they call \"areytos\", were their history passed from person to person, fathers to sons from the present to the future, as here uniting many Indians... passing three or four hours or more until the teacher or guide of the dance finished the history, and sometimes they went from one day to the next.\"  \\n\nArrival of the Spaniards\nWhen the Spaniards arrived on the island one of their first actions was to forcibly convert the Taínos into Christianity. They considered the ceremonial and religious practices of the Taínos as uncivilized and a form of paganism . The Taínos were enslaved and forced to build fortifications and to work the mines. Many died because of this harsh treatment, and also because of the introduction to diseases such as smallpox to the island by the Spaniards. However, before the Taíno tribes ceased to exist in Puerto Rico, Spanish historians such as Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, were able to witness and record the life and customs of these people.  \\n\nOngoing work\nThe continued restoration of Tibes by archaeologists is not an easy one. The following are some factors that are taken into consideration:   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The Cultural Center began as an organization founded in 1958 under the presidency of Amador Ramírez Silva as part of a project of the Puerto Rico Institute of Culture .  With the cooperation and donations of different institutions and people from Mayaguez, the Center starts to become a reality with a series of activities.  Since then the Municipal Administration has become an important column in the organization. [ citation needed ] \\n\nWith the city\\'s bicentennial approaching in 1960, the Bicentennial Committee proposed the construction of a building that would house the different facets of Mayagüez cultural life.  In 1968, the Cultural Center was finally inaugurated.  \\n\nDon Baudilio Vega Berríos, Mayor of the city , said during its inauguration, that: \"... in fact, at all classes social-working, artisans, dependents on commerce, businessmen, industrialists, it was notable the concern towards the joy in their cultural recreational field as so many jobs in their daily lives\".  Therefore, the building was constructed for the Cultural Center of the city of Mayagüez aiming to replace the old municipal theater using modern construction techniques.  \\n\nOn September 3, 1983 being mayor of the city Benjamin Cole , the Cultural Center was dedicated in honor of Baudilio Vega.  \\nCurrently, the Cultural Center of Mayagüez houses a public library, cultural theater and tourist office as well as the Municipal Bomba School.  \\n\nReferences\n18°12\\xe2\\x80\\xb204.01\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 67°08\\xe2\\x80\\xb223.91\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.2011139°N 67.1399750°W ﻿ / 18.2011139; -67.1399750 \\n"

The Center is located in a structure designed in 1870, and it is currently used for educational and cultural activities as well as for art exhibits.  Centro Cultural de Ponce was founded on 12 November 1963.   \\n\nHistory\nFounded in 1963 by Judith Rodríguez Mirailh and Helvetia Nicole, the organization was originally called La Casa de la Cultura (The House of Culture).  Since its founding, Centro Cultural has been \"actively promoting the artistic development on [Ponce]'s rich educational and intellectual environment\",  including the Noches de Galería , \"where renowned as well as promising painters, artisans and sculptors exhibit their works and showcase their talent.\"   The Centro Cultural de Ponce has occupied the structure at 70 Cristina Street since 1996. Prior to that its members met at members\\' homes and similar venues.  \\n\nOfferings\nAmong the Center\\'s offerings are \"Noches de Galería\" during which the organization shows off artistic rendering by Ponceños and Puerto Ricans in general. Over 75 of these have taken place on a monthly basis since their inception. This offering started under the leadership of then Centro president and painter José Balay Ruiz.  Centro Cultural also organizes and directs the yearly Feria de Artesanías de Ponce , which take place at Plaza Las Delicias every year during the month of April.\\n\nStructure\nThe structure, located at 18° 0\\' 44.244\" N, 66° 36\\' 39.9528\" W,  was designed in 1870 by the Corsican architect Juan Bertoli Calderoni . Its style incorporates elements of Colonial Spanish and Ponce Creole architecture. Its courtyard is surrounded by a gallery.  The building was originally built as the former home of Ermelindo Salazar , a prominent landowner, merchant, banker, as well as mayor of Ponce in 1880.   In 1959 the building became the first home of the Museo de Arte de Ponce .   Museo de Arte de Ponce moved to its current facility on Avenida Las Americas in 1965, vacating the structure at 70 Cristina Street. In 1990, the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña restored the structure to house the first headquarters of the Museo de la Música Puertorriqueña .   The house has the distinction of being the first one in the city to be served by a private telephone line.  The line exclusively communicated the owners' family residence with their commercial offices at the Ponce port . This was 17 years before the service finally arrived to the rest of the City.  \\n\nCarmen Solá de Pereira\nThe Center was named after Carmen Solá de Pereira, an outstanding educator and a representative from Ponce at the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly.  Solá de Pereira dedicated her life to the education of disadvantaged children. She was a teacher and school principal in La Cantera , an underprivileged community in Ponce, Puerto Rico.  \\n\nPresidents\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCentro del Sur Mall\n\\n\nCentro del Sur Mall is a shopping mall in Ponce, Puerto Rico . At the time of its inauguration in 1962,  it was Puerto Rico\\'s largest mall and \"the most modern mall in the Caribbean.\"  It is located at the intersection of Puerto Rico routes PR-163 ( Avenida Las Américas ) and PR-1 ( Bulevar Miguel Pou ). Its original building cost was $ 2,500,000 ($43 million in 2023 dollars  ).  It has been enlarged several times; including in 1991, in 2005, and again in 2010; this last time to accommodate the megastore Burlington .\\n\nHistory\nOn June 27, 1962, developed by IBEC Realty Company,  Centro del Sur inaugurated with anchors Kresge's , Barker's , and Grand Union . At the time it consisted of 120,000 square feet of retail space with 18 establishments such as Farmacias Moscoso , Thom McAn , Banco de Ponce , Elegance, Mayfair, and One-Hour Martinizing. The $2,500,000 shopping center which took two years to be built, being in plans since 1960, it was considered at the time the most modern shopping center in the Caribbean. It was constructed by engineer Santiago Castrodad, and featured a 436 foot long shopping corridor with benches, gardens, and a central fountain with colored lighting that served as main attractions at the mall. The shopping corridor was about 40 feet wide and over 21 feet high, with its drastically angled accordion-type roof. Barker's made its debut on the island with this new store at the shopping center.   \\n\nIn June 1987, the Kresge's store at the shopping center would close, leaving employees who had worked at the store for over 20 years without jobs.  \\n\nIn 1994, a space previously occupied by New York Department Stores became an extension of the main mall which then accommodated Marshalls , Tiendas Ferco, Me Salvé, Post Net, and six other local tenants. This also triggered a complete reconstruction of the mall\\'s entrance and facade. The combination of the re-tenanting and remodeling the center proved to be very successful as sales figures increased consistently.  \\n\nIn 1995, the Malecón Ave. overpass was completed providing new and better access to the shopping center and approximately 150 additional parking spaces for a total of 1,350 parking spaces.  \\n\nIn 2005, a 20,000 square foot expansion for the Marshalls Megastore was to be completed by July of that year.  \\n\nIn the late 2000s, the mall was anchored by a Marshalls Megastore , Farmacias El Amal , and a Pitusa . Rincón del Sabor the food court at the mall had food options for all tastes, such as Subway , AKA Los Tacos, Mr. Pretzels, Crave, Goodies, Charlie's Pizza, Country Deli, and Villa China's chinese exquisite food. Tenants at the time were establishments such as Me Salvé, Almacenes Kress , Marianne, Rave, Madison, Jeans.com, Payless Shoe Source , Radio Shack , Foot Locker , La Defensa, Kay-Bee Toys , Rent-A-Center , and Western Auto .   \\n\nOn June 24, 2010, it was reported that a new 69,595 square foot Burlington Coat Factory store would be located in the section of the mall that formerly housed Western Auto , Pitusa , Farmacia El Amal , Madison and Rent-A-Center , with the latter two stores being relocated to another section of the mall. Located in Ponce , the 220,304 square foot Centro del Sur Mall had enjoyed additional exposure and traffic as the result of renewal efforts in the southern city\\'s historic section at the time.  \\n\nOn March 27, 2011, the Burlington Coat Factory store at the mall finally inaugurated.  \\n\nIn October 2012, a Burlington Baby Depot store opened at the mall.  \\n\nNotability\nCentro del Sur made history as Puerto Rico\\'s largest mall until the 1968 opening of Plaza Las Americas in San Juan.  Randall Peffer, of Lonely Planet , calls Centro del Sur \"the place where shopping addicts head to when they need \\'mall fixes\\'\".  During the 300th anniversary of the founding of the city of Ponce, the mall gained prominence for being the mall closest to the Ponce Historic Zone .  \\n\nDesign\nA unique characteristic of this mall is its zig-zag prefab reinforced concrete roof which is not found in any other mall in Puerto Rico.  The mall\\'s main corridor is oriented in a north-south axis, with a shorter east-west axis and a smaller east-west hallway.  Centro del Sur is the first and only mall in Puerto Rico with a truss zig-zag prefab concrete roof system.  \\n\nTenants\nCentro del Sur has over 50 stores and more than 30 kiosks and food court vendors.  An area for community events at the mall is unique among malls in Puerto Rico.  The Mall has been southern Puerto Rico\\'s regional outlet for a number of major national departmental chains including Kresge , Barker\\'s , Marshalls and Burlington . The mall is managed by Commercial Centers Management.\\n\nLocation\nThe mall is located on the southwestern corner of Miguel Pou Boulevard ( PR-1 ) and Las Americas Avenue ( PR-163 ).  The main branch of the Ponce Public Library is within walking distance west of the mall, and Urbanizacion La Alhambra, Puerto Rico\\'s first upper-class suburban development,  is located diagonally across from the Mall to the northwest. This puts it just outside the Ponce Historic Zone .\\n\nA limited-access highway, PR-12 , also known as Avenida Santiago de los Caballeros, and which opened to the public in 1995, was built just west of the mall providing easy access to it. The mall is flanked by several outlying banks, and restaurants which together bring the total effective retail area within the plaza to over 350,000 square feet   The mall is also readily accessible via taxi service with the Union Taxi terminal depot located at the mall\\'s main eastern entrance.  \\n\nAccolades\nCentro del Sur Mall was the venue used by Melina León to debut her new album \"Corazón de Mujer\"  Other talent shows have also taken place here.  On 24 December 1966, the mall became the first public place in Puerto Rico where Santa Claus landed via a helicopter to hand out gifts to waiting children, a marketing and advertising stunt.  Today, the yearly \"Miss Centro del Sur\" event takes place instead.  \\n\nReferences"

It is intended to be used primarily for trade shows , conventions and sporting events . It opened in June, 2012.  One of the first pre-inauguration activities was a set of Olympic boxing pre-match games.   Its official inauguration was subsequently set for September 2012.  However, its official inauguration took place on 11 October 2012.  \\n\nVariously known as Centro de Convenciones de Ponce , Centro de Convenciones de Ponce Juan H. Cintrón ,  and Complejo Ferial de Puerto Rico Juan H. Cintrón Garcia , the center was built to serve the local as well as the international business market.  The Centro de Convenciones de Ponce was named after former Ponce Mayor Juan H. Cintrón García .   Centro de Convenciones de Ponce is unique among other convention centers in Puerto Rico for the flexibility of its interior spaces.  It is owned by the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce.  \\n\nHistory\nConstruction of the structure started on 20 October 2008,   under the administration of Mayor Francisco Zayas Seijo .  The building design was commissioned to architect Fernando Gonzalez Diaz and his architectural firm Urban Venture Group.  Urban Venture Group with their consultants; Pedro Dario Del Nero (structural engineer), Jorge Ledón Webster (mechanical engineer), Ricardo Rodriguez Del Valle (electrical engineer), Alfred J. Longhitano (codes) and Manuel Quilichini (civil engineer), formed the team that developed the Architecture and Interior design of \"Complejo Ferial de Puerto Rico\".  The structure was built by local Ponce construction company Venegas Construction.  It was ordered by the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce at a cost of $41 million USD , excluding its access roads and parking lot. These engaged an additional $3.9 million.   Some 400 workmen labored in the construction of the structure.  \\n\nManagement\nThe Center is managed by a public municipal corporation independent of the Municipal Government but which reports to it.  The corporation is headed by a five-member governing board. According to current by-laws of the municipality, one of the members of the governing body must be the municipal finance director, and the other four members are appointed by the mayor. The primary objective in creating a municipal corporation for the management and administration of Centro de Convenciones is \"to exempt it from being bound by the bureaucracy required by the Law of Autonomous Municipalities\"  One of the obligations of the new corporation is to sign a long-term contract with an operator for the administration and day-to-day operation of the Center.  Various companies were mentioned as potential managers and interested parties, including SMG Worldwide Entertainment and Convention Venue Management , Intertrade Development Group, and Grupo Serralles , owners of the Ponce Hilton Resort and Casino.  In the end, Intertrade Development Group was chosen as the operator.  \\n\nFeatures\nThe building is a two-story structure.  The main exhibit hall features 120,000 square feet of exhibit space.  The main exhibit hall can be structured into 16 smaller and independent mixed-used rooms to simultaneously accommodate various activities, such as conventions, concerts, weddings, and corporate meetings.  Each of the 16 rooms will have its own independently controlled climate and sound systems.  The property also features a planned parking lot with capacity for 700 vehicles.  There is also an area with a view of Rio Portugues with a capacity for 300 persons.  The Puerto Rico Senate voted to name this structure \"Centro de Convenciones de Ponce Juan H. Cintron \" in honor to the Ponce politician.  \\n\nNotable events\nAn international design festival, Boom Fair 2013, took place during August 2013.  A cardiovascular health symposium, sponsored by Hospital Episcopal San Lucas , followed on 24 August 2013.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

[ note 1 ] The mountain is part of the Cordillera Central and is located on the town boundary between the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya in the central region of the main island of Puerto Rico.      \\n\nLocation\nThe mountain is part of the Cordillera Central and is located on the municipality of Jayuya, Puerto Rico.     The access road to the point closest to the highest elevation is from the municipality of Jayuya.  It is part of the Toro Negro Forest Reserve , and it has been described as \"an alpine runt.\"  It is located on the western end of the Toro Negro State Park. The mountain is just north of east-to-westbound Route 143 . It is located at coordinates 18.172458 and -66.591839W. The nearest populated place to Cerro de Punta is Urbanización Vega Linda , located 3.3 miles (5.3 km) away.\\n\nGeology\nUnlike many Caribbean mountains, Cerro de Punta is not a volcano but simply the highest point in the Cordillera Central . Cordillera Central is the central mountain range that divides the island by running in an east-west fashion.  \\n\nBest view\nThe view from atop Cerro de Punta is said to be \"the best view in all of Puerto Rico\". On a clear day, it is possible to see virtually the entire island, including as far as San Juan , which is over 75 miles (120 km) away.  There are a number of radio and television transmission and re-transmission towers just off the top of the mountain.  There is an observation platform at the top of the mountain.  \\n\nWildlife and flora\nThe mountain is home to an abundant amount of wildlife, lush vegetation, flowering shrubs and trees, and numerous waterfalls .  The mountain is covered by Sierra palm trees.  Various plants, including some endangered species are found here,  such as the endangered fern Elaphoglossum serpens which is found only on this mountain and nowhere else in the world,  and Cook\\'s holly ( Ilex cookii ) or planta de te , which is only found here and in neighboring Mount Jayuya .  \\n\nNearby roads\nThe area consists of many steep mountains. The nearest road is PR-143 , which is a winding two-lane mountain road that must be travelled very slowly as it is not possible to see traffic coming from the opposite direction for any significant length. Off Route 143 is the road that actually leads to the mountain\\'s top. Route 143 can be accessed via the better-traveled Route 10 .  Route 143 is part of the Ruta Panorámica .  \\n\nHiking and access trail\nA nearby inn called Hacienda Gripiñas , has a trail that leads to the top of the mountain. Hacienda Gripiñas was a coffee plantation, but has been turned into a country inn. In 2010 it still grew some coffee.  The inn operates under a contract with the Government of Puerto Rico.  The trails, however, are not well marked and often suffer damage from storms.  While people can hike their way to the top of the mountain, there is a paved road that leads to the very summit.  The Toro Negro State Forest has 12 miles (19 km) of hiking trails some of which lead to the top of Cerro de Punta.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCerro Las Tetas\n\\n\nCerro Las Tetas , nicknamed Las Tetas de Cayey but officially Las Piedras del Collado ,   are two mountain peaks located in the municipality of Salinas, Puerto Rico ,  north of the city of Salinas proper. Since September 1, 2000, the peaks have become part of the Las Piedras del Collado Nature Reserve and are protected by law.  Their height is 2,762 feet (842 m) above sea level.  \\n\nEtymology\nThe Cerro Las Tetas are so-named for their resemblance to a female's breasts ; tetas is colloquial for \"breasts\" in Spanish, much like the English slang \"tits\".  \\n\nLocation\nA common misconception is that Las Tetas are located in the municipality of Cayey. Las Tetas are actually located the municipality of Salinas , in Barrio Palmas, a barrio on the northwestern part of the municipality of Salinas.  They are located close to\\xe2\\x80\\x94but not in\\xe2\\x80\\x94the municipality of Cayey , thus the \"de Cayey\" (English \"of Cayey\") in its name. They are located about 500 metres (1,600 ft) southwest of the intersection of PR-1 and PR-162 . Topological maps readily show this.    \\n\nThe Las Tetas peaks are part of the Sierra de Cayey (or Cayey Range).  The Sierra de Cayey , like the Cordillera Central and Sierra de Luquillo ranges, extends over several municipalities beyond Cayey.  The name of the mountain range where Las Tetas is located (Sierra de Cayey ) may be a possible source of confusion regarding the location of the peaks themselves:  a little-known fact is that the town of Cayey derives its name from Sierra de Cayey, and not the other-way-around.  \\n\nAnother possible source of confusion may lie in the fact that the road to reach the peaks begins from within the Municipality of Cayey\\xe2\\x80\\x94albeit just meters from its border with the Municipality of Salinas.  A third possible source of confusion, about the municipality where the mountains are located, may be the fact that the peaks are located closer to downtown Cayey than to downtown Salinas.  Cayey is also a land-locked , mostly mountainous municipality; Salinas, by comparison and as a municipality on the southern coastal plain, consists mostly of flatlands. This may be a fourth reason yet why many people believe Las Tetas mountain peaks are located in Cayey, and not in Salinas. Yet another possible reason for the confusion may be that, in order to locate Las Tetas on the official USGS map, the map for the Cayey Quadrangle is used.  \\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the town of Salinas took the town of Cayey to court over the location of \"Las Tetas\" and won the case. The matter involved land development and the Puerto Rico Planning Board. The result was a vindication of the claim that the \"Las Tetas\" location as being in the municipality of Cayey was incorrect. Las Tetas, the Court agreed, are actually \"Las Tetas de Salinas\" for they are actually located within the municipality of Salinas, not in Cayey.  They have also been called Las Tetas de Salinas.  Even so, the name of the mountains are so embedded in Puerto Rican tradition that they continue to be called \"Las Tetas de Cayey\".\\n\nThe Las Tetas peaks can be easily viewed from the rest area on Puerto Rico Highway 52 , located at kilometer post 49.0 of that highway. The rest area is colocated with the Monumento al Jíbaro Puertorriqueño statue and monument, in the municipality of Salinas.  The two peaks can be seen in the northwestern horizon when viewing from the rest area.  \\n\nHiking, mountain climbing, and camping at Cerro Las Tetas can be arranged by local tour companies.  \\n\nHeight\nThe peaks are contoured at 841 metres (2,759 ft) high. However, the western Teta is actually 20 meters higher than its eastern twin.  \\n\nViews\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

It is located in Mayagüez , Puerto Rico. The company\\'s main brand is Medalla Light .  \\n\nHistory\nThe company was founded on November 2, 1937, by the brothers Valdés Cobián: Alfonso , Sabino and Ramón Valdés Cobián , in Mayagüez , the largest city on the west coast of Puerto Rico . The Valdés brothers were following the example of their father, Don Ramon Valdés, who had founded the Mayagüez Light, Power and Ice Company in 1910. In 1938, their first beer, Cerveza India, was released to the public. The company competed with two other native beer breweries, \"Real\" and \"Cerveceria Corona\" (Cerveceria Corona de Puerto Rico \"subsequently sold its trademark rights to Cervecería Modelo de México, which then launched Cerveza Corona as Modelo\\'s Corona Extra).\"  Alfonso , as chairman and president, successfully led his company converting it into Puerto Rico\\'s largest beer brewery and manufacturer of canned and bottled soft drinks.\\n\nIn the late 70s, the brewery was forced to expand its portfolio and produce a lighter beer with less calories than their Cerveza India. Until that time, India was the only alcoholic beverage producing plant in Mayagüez.\\n\nIn 1985, their main competition, Corona, went bankrupt and left a free way to Cervecería India, which was in full swing after the release of its new product Medalla Light years before.  In October 2009, the brewery reverted its name to \"Compañía Cervecera de Puerto Rico\".\\n\nFrom 2002 to 2017, Camalia Valdés served as president and CEO of the company.  In 2017, Grace Marie Valdés succeeded Camalia as president and CEO.  \\n\nThe company works to promote the art and culture of Puerto Rico.  It soon later launched an artisanal brewery, Del Oeste Brewery within its main brewing facility.\\n\nIn 2018, the company announced a distribution agreement to expand the Medalla Light brand into the United States, specifically Florida.  \\n\nProducts\nThe company\\'s main product is Medalla Light , a 4.2% abv pale lager .  The brewery also produces Malta India , a non-alcoholic soft drink made from barley. In 1940, it began producing Orange Crush and Old Colony sodas. In May 2010, the brewery announced the launch of their new beer, Silver Key Light, which hit the market on June 1, 2010.  They launched Magna, a premium beer, on August 1, 2011.  On November 5, 2019, Cerveza India, which was their first beer, was relaunched as a limited edition.\\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°12\\xe2\\x80\\xb224.24\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 67°08\\xe2\\x80\\xb229.33\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.2067333°N 67.1414806°W ﻿ / 18.2067333; -67.1414806 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nChristopher Columbus\n\\n\\n\nChristopher Columbus [ b ]  was an Italian  [ c ] explorer and navigator from the Republic of Genoa who completed four Spanish-based voyages across the Atlantic Ocean sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs , opening the way for the widespread European exploration and colonization of the Americas . His expeditions were the first known European contact with the Caribbean and Central and South America.\\n\nThe name Christopher Columbus is the anglicisation of the Latin Christophorus Columbus . Growing up on the coast of Liguria , he went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana . He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo , who bore a son, Diego , and was based in Lisbon for several years. He later took a Castilian mistress, Beatriz Enríquez de Arana , who bore a son, Ferdinand .    \\n\nLargely self-educated, Columbus was knowledgeable in geography, astronomy, and history. He developed a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies , hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade . After the Granada War , and Columbus\\'s persistent lobbying in multiple kingdoms, the Catholic Monarchs , Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II , agreed to sponsor a journey west. Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships and made landfall in the Americas on 12 October, ending the period of human habitation in the Americas now referred to as the pre-Columbian era . His landing place was an island in the Bahamas , known by its native inhabitants as Guanahani . He then visited the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola , establishing a colony in what is now Haiti . Columbus returned to Castile in early 1493, with captured natives. Word of his voyage soon spread throughout Europe.\\n\nColumbus made three further voyages to the Americas, exploring the Lesser Antilles in 1493, Trinidad and the northern coast of South America in 1498, and the east coast of Central America in 1502. Many names he gave to geographical features, particularly islands, are still in use. He gave the name indios (\"Indians\") to the indigenous peoples he encountered. The extent to which he was aware the Americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain; he never clearly renounced his belief he had reached the Far East. As a colonial governor, Columbus was accused by some of his contemporaries of significant brutality and removed from the post. Columbus\\'s strained relationship with the Crown of Castile and its colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and removal from Hispaniola in 1500, and later to protracted litigation over the privileges he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown.\\n\nColumbus\\'s expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted for centuries, thus bringing the Americas into the European sphere of influence. The transfer of plants, animals, precious metals, culture, human populations, technology, diseases, and ideas between the Old World and New World that followed his first voyage are known as the Columbian exchange . These events and the effects which persist to the present are often cited as the beginning of the modern era .   \\n\nColumbus was widely celebrated in the centuries after his death, but public perception fractured in the 21st century due to greater attention to the harms committed under his governance, particularly the beginning of the depopulation of Hispaniola\\'s indigenous Taíno people, caused by Old World diseases and mistreatment, including slavery . Many places in the Western Hemisphere bear his name , including the South American country of Colombia , the Canadian province of British Columbia , the American city Columbus, Ohio , and the U.S. capital, the District of Columbia .\\n\nEarly life\nColumbus\\'s early life is obscure, but scholars believe he was born in the Republic of Genoa between 25 August and 31 October 1451.  His father was Domenico Colombo , a wool weaver who worked in Genoa and Savona , and owned a cheese stand at which young Christopher worked. His mother was Susanna Fontanarossa .  He had three brothers\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Bartholomew , Giovanni Pellegrino, and Giacomo (also called Diego)  \\xe2\\x80\\x94as well as a sister, Bianchinetta.  Bartholomew ran a cartography workshop in Lisbon for at least part of his adulthood.  \\n\nHis native language is presumed to have been a Genoese dialect ( Ligurian ) as his first language, though Columbus probably never wrote in it.  His name in 15th-century Genoese was Cristoffa Corombo ,  in Italian, Cristoforo Colombo , and in Spanish Cristóbal Colón .   \\n\nIn one of his writings, he says he went to sea at 14.  In 1470, the family moved to Savona , where Domenico took over a tavern. Some modern authors have argued that he was not from Genoa, but from the Aragon region of Spain  or from Portugal.  These competing hypotheses have been discounted by most scholars.   \\n\nIn 1473, Columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the wealthy Spinola , Centurione, and Di Negro families of Genoa.  Later, he made a trip to the Greek island Chios in the Aegean Sea , then ruled by Genoa.  In May 1476, he took part in an armed convoy sent by Genoa to carry valuable cargo to northern Europe. He probably visited Bristol , England,  and Galway , Ireland,  where he may have visited St. Nicholas\\' Collegiate Church .  It has been speculated he went to Iceland in 1477, though many scholars doubt this.     It is known that in the autumn of 1477, he sailed on a Portuguese ship from Galway to Lisbon, where he found his brother Bartholomew, and they continued trading for the Centurione family. Columbus based himself in Lisbon from 1477 to 1485. In 1478, the Centuriones sent Columbus on a sugar-buying trip to Madeira.  He married Felipa Perestrello e Moniz , daughter of Bartolomeu Perestrello , a Portuguese nobleman of Lombard origin,  who had been the donatary captain of Porto Santo .  \\n\nIn 1479 or 1480, Columbus\\'s son Diego was born. Between 1482 and 1485, Columbus traded along the coasts of West Africa , reaching the Portuguese trading post of Elmina at the Guinea coast in present-day Ghana .  Before 1484, Columbus returned to Porto Santo to find that his wife had died.  He returned to Portugal to settle her estate and take Diego with him.  \\n\nHe left Portugal for Castile in 1485, where he took a mistress in 1487, a 20-year-old orphan named Beatriz Enríquez de Arana .  It is likely that Beatriz met Columbus when he was in Córdoba , a gathering place for Genoese merchants and where the court of the Catholic Monarchs was located at intervals. Beatriz, unmarried at the time, gave birth to Columbus\\'s second son, Fernando Columbus , in July 1488, named for the monarch of Aragon. Columbus recognized the boy as his offspring. Columbus entrusted his older, legitimate son Diego to take care of Beatriz and pay the pension set aside for her following his death, but Diego was negligent in his duties.  \\n\nColumbus learned Latin , Portuguese, and Castilian. He read widely about astronomy, geography, and history, including the works of Ptolemy , Pierre d\\'Ailly \\'s Imago Mundi , the travels of Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville , Pliny \\'s Natural History , and Pope Pius II \\'s Historia rerum ubique gestarum . According to historian Edmund Morgan ,\\n\nColumbus was not a scholarly man. Yet he studied these books, made hundreds of marginal notations in them and came out with ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong ... \nQuest for Asia\nUnder the Mongol Empire \\'s hegemony over Asia and the Pax Mongolica , Europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage on the Silk Road to India , parts of East Asia , including China and Maritime Southeast Asia , which were sources of valuable goods. With the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, the Silk Road was closed to Christian traders.  \\n\nIn 1474, the Florentine astronomer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli suggested to King Afonso V of Portugal that sailing west across the Atlantic would be a quicker way to reach the Maluku (Spice) Islands, China , Japan and India than the route around Africa, but Afonso rejected his proposal.   In the 1480s, Columbus and his brother proposed a plan to reach the East Indies by sailing west. Columbus supposedly wrote to Toscanelli in 1481 and received encouragement, along with a copy of a map the astronomer had sent Afonso implying that a westward route to Asia was possible.  Columbus\\'s plans were complicated by Bartolomeu Dias \\'s rounding of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, which suggested the Cape Route around Africa to Asia.  \\n\nColumbus had to wait until 1492 for King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain to support his voyage across the Atlantic to find gold, spices, a safer route to the East, and converts to Christianity.     \\n\nCarol Delaney and other commentators have argued that Columbus was a Christian millennialist and apocalypticist and that these beliefs motivated his quest for Asia in a variety of ways. Columbus often wrote about seeking gold in the log books of his voyages and writes about acquiring it \"in such quantity that the sovereigns... will undertake and prepare to go conquer the Holy Sepulcher \" in a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy . [ d ] Columbus often wrote about converting all races to Christianity.  Abbas Hamandi argues that Columbus was motivated by the hope of \"[delivering] Jerusalem from Muslim hands\" by \"using the resources of newly discovered lands\".  \\n\nDespite a popular misconception to the contrary, nearly all educated Westerners of Columbus\\'s time knew that the Earth is spherical , a concept that had been understood since antiquity .  The techniques of celestial navigation , which uses the position of the Sun and the stars in the sky, had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners.   \\n\nHowever Columbus made several errors in calculating the size of the Earth, the distance the continent extended to the east, and therefore the distance to the west to reach his goal.\\n\nFirst, as far back as the 3rd century BC, Eratosthenes had correctly computed the circumference of the Earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two remote locations.   In the 1st century BC, Posidonius confirmed Eratosthenes\\'s results by comparing stellar observations at two separate locations. These measurements were widely known among scholars, but Ptolemy\\'s use of the smaller, old-fashioned units of distance led Columbus to underestimate the size of the Earth by about a third.  \\n\nSecond, three cosmographical parameters determined the bounds of Columbus\\'s enterprise: the distance across the ocean between Europe and Asia, which depended on the extent of the oikumene , i.e., the Eurasian land-mass stretching east-west between Spain and China; the circumference of the Earth; and the number of miles or leagues in a degree of longitude , which was possible to deduce from the theory of the relationship between the size of the surfaces of water and the land as held by the followers of Aristotle in medieval times.  \\n\nFrom Pierre d\\'Ailly \\'s Imago Mundi (1410), Columbus learned of Alfraganus \\'s estimate that a degree of latitude (equal to approximately a degree of longitude along the equator) spanned 56.67 Arabic miles (equivalent to 66.2 nautical miles, 122.6 kilometers or 76.2 mi), but he did not realize that this was expressed in the Arabic mile (about 1,830 meters or 1.14 mi) rather than the shorter Roman mile (about 1,480 m) with which he was familiar.  Columbus therefore estimated the size of the Earth to be about 75% of Eratosthenes\\'s calculation.  \\n\nThird, most scholars of the time accepted Ptolemy\\'s estimate that Eurasia spanned 180° longitude,  rather than the actual 130° (to the Chinese mainland) or 150° (to Japan at the latitude of Spain). Columbus believed an even higher estimate, leaving a smaller percentage for water.  In d\\'Ailly\\'s Imago Mundi , Columbus read Marinus of Tyre \\'s estimate that the longitudinal span of Eurasia was 225° at the latitude of Rhodes .  Some historians, such as Samuel Eliot  Morison , have suggested that he followed the statement in the apocryphal book 2 Esdras ( 6:42 ) that \"six parts [of the globe] are habitable and the seventh is covered with water.\"  He was also aware of Marco Polo\\'s claim that Japan (which he called \"Cipangu\") was some 2,414 km (1,500 mi) to the east of China (\"Cathay\"),  and closer to the equator than it is. He was influenced by Toscanelli\\'s idea that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than Japan, including the mythical Antillia , which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the Azores ,  and the distance westward from the Canary Islands to the Indies as only 68 degrees, equivalent to 3,080 nmi (5,700 km; 3,540 mi) (a 58% error).  \\n\nBased on his sources, Columbus estimated a distance of 2,400 nmi (4,400 km; 2,800 mi) from the Canary Islands west to Japan; the actual distance is 10,600 nmi (19,600 km; 12,200 mi).   No ship in the 15th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage,  and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable. Most European navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from Europe to Asia was unfeasible. The Catholic Monarchs, however, having completed the Reconquista , an expensive war against the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula , were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other European countries in the quest for trade with the Indies. Columbus\\'s project, though far-fetched, held the promise of such an advantage.  \\n\nThough Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the Far East and about the distance that each degree represented, he did take advantage of the trade winds , which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean. He planned to first sail to the Canary Islands before continuing west with the northeast trade wind.  Part of the return to Spain would require traveling against the wind using an arduous sailing technique called beating , during which progress is made very slowly.  To effectively make the return voyage, Columbus would need to follow the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where he would be able to catch the \" westerlies \" that blow eastward to the coast of Western Europe.  \\n\nThe navigational technique for travel in the Atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the Portuguese, who referred to it as the volta do mar (\\'turn of the sea\\'). Through his marriage to his first wife, Felipa Perestrello, Columbus had access to the nautical charts and logs that had belonged to her deceased father, Bartolomeu Perestrello , who had served as a captain in the Portuguese navy under Prince Henry the Navigator . In the mapmaking shop where he worked with his brother Bartholomew, Columbus also had ample opportunity to hear the stories of old seamen about their voyages to the western seas,  but his knowledge of the Atlantic wind patterns was still imperfect at the time of his first voyage. By sailing due west from the Canary Islands during hurricane season , skirting the so-called horse latitudes of the mid-Atlantic, he risked being becalmed and running into a tropical cyclone , both of which he avoided by chance.  \\n\nBy about 1484, Columbus proposed his planned voyage to King John II of Portugal .  The king submitted Columbus\\'s proposal to his advisors, who rejected it, correctly, on the grounds that Columbus\\'s estimate for a voyage of 2,400 nmi was only a quarter of what it should have been.  In 1488, Columbus again appealed to the court of Portugal, and John II again granted him an audience. That meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards Bartolomeu Dias returned to Portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa (near the Cape of Good Hope ).   \\n\nColumbus sought an audience with the monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile , who had united several kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula by marrying and now ruled together. On 1 May 1486, permission having been granted, Columbus presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who, in turn, referred it to a committee. The learned men of Spain, like their counterparts in Portugal, replied that Columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to Asia. They pronounced the idea impractical and advised the Catholic Monarchs to pass on the proposed venture. To keep Columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the sovereigns gave him an allowance, totaling about 14,000 maravedis for the year, or about the annual salary of a sailor.  In May 1489, the queen sent him another 10,000 maravedis , and the same year the monarchs furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their dominion to provide him food and lodging at no cost.  \\n\nColumbus also dispatched his brother Bartholomew to the court of Henry VII of England to inquire whether the English crown might sponsor his expedition, but he was captured by pirates en route, and only arrived in early 1491.  By that time, Columbus had retreated to La Rábida Friary , where the Spanish crown sent him 20,000 maravedis to buy new clothes and instructions to return to the Spanish court for renewed discussions.  \\n\nColumbus waited at King Ferdinand\\'s camp until Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada , the last Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, in January 1492. A council led by Isabella\\'s confessor, Hernando de Talavera , found Columbus\\'s proposal to reach the Indies implausible. Columbus had left for France when Ferdinand intervened, [ e ] first sending Talavera and Bishop Diego Deza to appeal to the queen.  Isabella was finally convinced by the king\\'s clerk Luis de Santángel , who argued that Columbus would take his ideas elsewhere, and offered to help arrange the funding. Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch Columbus, who had traveled 2 leagues (over 10 km) toward Córdoba.  \\n\nIn the April 1492 \" Capitulations of Santa Fe \", King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella promised Columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed Viceroy and Governor of all the new lands he might claim for Spain.  He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10% ( diezmo ) of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity. He also would have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture in the new lands, and receive one-eighth ( ochavo ) of the profits.    \\n\nIn 1500, during his third voyage to the Americas, Columbus was arrested and dismissed from his posts. He and his sons, Diego and Fernando, then conducted a lengthy series of court cases against the Castilian crown , known as the pleitos colombinos , alleging that the Crown had illegally reneged on its contractual obligations to Columbus and his heirs.  The Columbus family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego\\'s position as viceroy but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes initiated by heirs continued until 1790.  \\n\nVoyages\nBetween 1492 and 1504, Columbus completed four round-trip voyages between Spain and the Americas , each voyage being sponsored by the Crown of Castile . On his first voyage he reached the Americas, initiating the European exploration and colonization of the continent , as well as the Columbian exchange . His role in history is thus important to the Age of Discovery , Western history , and human history writ large.  \\n\nIn Columbus\\'s letter on the first voyage , published following his first return to Spain, he claimed that he had reached Asia,  as previously described by Marco Polo and other Europeans. Over his subsequent voyages, Columbus refused to acknowledge that the lands he visited and claimed for Spain were not part of Asia, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary.  This might explain, in part, why the American continent was named after the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci \\xe2\\x80\\x94who received credit for recognizing it as a \" New World \"\\xe2\\x80\\x94and not after Columbus.  [ f ] \\n\nOn the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera with three ships. The largest was a carrack , the Santa María , owned and captained by Juan de la Cosa , and under Columbus\\'s direct command.  The other two were smaller caravels , the Pinta and the Niña ,  piloted by the Pinzón brothers .  Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands. There he restocked provisions and made repairs then departed from San Sebastián de La Gomera on 6 September,  for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean.\\n\n\\nOn 7 October, the crew spotted \"[i]mmense flocks of birds\".  On 11 October, Columbus changed the fleet\\'s course to due west, and sailed through the night, believing land was soon to be found. At around 02:00 the following morning, a lookout on the Pinta , Rodrigo de Triana , spotted land. The captain of the Pinta , Martín Alonso Pinzón , verified the sight of land and alerted Columbus.   Columbus later maintained that he had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier, thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by Ferdinand and Isabella to the first person to sight land.   Columbus called this island (in what is now the Bahamas) San Salvador (meaning \"Holy Savior\"); the natives called it Guanahani .  [ h ] Christopher Columbus\\'s journal entry of 12 October 1492 states:\nI saw some who had marks of wounds on their bodies and I made signs to them asking what they were; and they showed me how people from other islands nearby came there and tried to take them, and how they defended themselves; and I believed and believe that they come here from tierra firme to take them captive. They should be good and intelligent servants, for I see that they say very quickly everything that is said to them; and I believe they would become Christians very easily, for it seemed to me that they had no religion. Our Lord pleasing, at the time of my departure I will take six of them from here to Your Highnesses in order that they may learn to speak. \nColumbus called the inhabitants of the lands that he visited Los Indios (Spanish for \"Indians\").  He initially encountered the Lucayan , Taíno , and Arawak peoples.  Noting their gold ear ornaments, Columbus took some of the Arawaks prisoner and insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold.  Columbus did not believe he needed to create a fortified outpost, writing, \"the people here are simple in war-like matters ... I could conquer the whole of them with fifty men, and govern them as I pleased.\"  The Taínos told Columbus that another indigenous tribe, the Caribs , were fierce warriors and cannibals , who made frequent raids on the Taínos, often capturing their women, although this may have been a belief perpetuated by the Spaniards to justify enslaving them.   \\n\nColumbus also explored the northeast coast of Cuba, where he landed on 28 October. On the night of 26 November, Martín Alonso Pinzón took the Pinta on an unauthorized expedition in search of an island called \"Babeque\" or \"Baneque\",  which the natives had told him was rich in gold.  Columbus, for his part, continued to the northern coast of Hispaniola , where he landed on 6 December.  There, the Santa María ran aground on 25 December 1492 and had to be abandoned. The wreck was used as a target for cannon fire to impress the native peoples.  Columbus was received by the native cacique Guacanagari , who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus left 39 men, including the interpreter Luis de Torres ,  [ i ] and founded the settlement of La Navidad , in present-day Haiti .   Columbus took more natives prisoner and continued his exploration.  He kept sailing along the northern coast of Hispaniola with a single ship until he encountered Pinzón and the Pinta on 6 January.  \\n\nOn 13 January 1493, Columbus made his last stop of this voyage in the Americas, in the Bay of Rincón in northeast Hispaniola.  There he encountered the Ciguayos , the only natives who offered violent resistance during this voyage.  The Ciguayos refused to trade the amount of bows and arrows that Columbus desired; in the ensuing clash one Ciguayo was stabbed in the buttocks and another wounded with an arrow in his chest.  Because of these events, Columbus called the inlet the Golfo de Las Flechas ( Bay of Arrows ).  \\n\nColumbus headed for Spain on the Niña , but a storm separated him from the Pinta, and forced the Niña to stop at the island of Santa Maria in the Azores. Half of his crew went ashore to say prayers of thanksgiving in a chapel for having survived the storm. But while praying, they were imprisoned by the governor of the island, ostensibly on suspicion of being pirates. After a two-day standoff, the prisoners were released, and Columbus again set sail for Spain.  \\n\nAnother storm forced Columbus into the port at Lisbon .  From there he went to Vale do Paraíso north of Lisbon to meet King John II of Portugal, who told Columbus that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 Treaty of Alcá\\xc3 7ovas . After spending more than a week in Portugal, Columbus set sail for Spain. Returning to Palos on 15 March 1493, he was given a hero\\'s welcome and soon afterward received by Isabella and Ferdinand in Barcelona.  To them he presented kidnapped Taínos and various plants and items he had collected.  : 54 \\n\nColumbus\\'s letter on the first voyage , probably dispatched to the Spanish court upon arrival in Lisbon, was instrumental in spreading the news throughout Europe about his voyage. Almost immediately after his arrival in Spain, printed versions began to appear, and word of his voyage spread rapidly.  Most people initially believed that he had reached Asia.  The Bulls of Donation , three papal bulls of Pope Alexander VI delivered in 1493, purported to grant overseas territories to Portugal and the Catholic Monarchs of Spain. They were replaced by the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494.  \\n\nThe two earliest published copies of Columbus\\'s letter on the first voyage aboard the Niña were donated in 2017 by the Jay I. Kislak Foundation to the University of Miami library in Coral Gables, Florida , where they are housed.  \\n\nOn 24 September 1493, Columbus sailed from Cádiz with 17 ships, and supplies to establish permanent colonies in the Americas. He sailed with nearly 1,500 men, including sailors, soldiers, priests, carpenters, stonemasons, metalworkers, and farmers. Among the expedition members were Alvarez Chanca , a physician who wrote a detailed account of the second voyage; Juan Ponce de León, the first governor of Puerto Rico and Florida; the father of Bartolomé de las Casas; Juan de la Cosa , a cartographer who is credited with making the first world map depicting the New World ; and Columbus\\'s youngest brother Diego.  The fleet stopped at the Canary Islands to take on more supplies, and set sail again on 7 October, deliberately taking a more southerly course than on the first voyage.  \\n\nOn 3 November, they arrived in the Windward Islands ; the first island they encountered was named Dominica by Columbus, but not finding a good harbor there, they anchored off a nearby smaller island, which he named Mariagalante , now a part of Guadeloupe and called Marie-Galante . Other islands named by Columbus on this voyage were Montserrat , Antigua , Saint Martin , the Virgin Islands , as well as many others.  \\n\nOn 17 November, Columbus first sighted the eastern coast of the island of Puerto Rico , known to its native Taino people as Borikén . His fleet sailed along the island\\'s southern coast for a whole day, before making landfall on its northwestern coast at the Bay of Añasco , early on 19 November. Upon landing, Columbus christened the island San Juan Bautista after John the Baptist , and remained anchored there for two days from 20 to 21 November, filling the water casks of the ships in his fleet.  \\n\nOn 22 November, Columbus returned to Hispaniola to visit La Navidad in modern-day Haiti , where 39 Spaniards had been left during the first voyage. Columbus found the fort in ruins. He learned from Guacanagaríx , the local tribe leader, that his men had quarreled over gold and taken women from the tribe, and that after some left for the territory of Caonabo , Caonabo came and burned the fort and killed the rest of the men there.     \\n\nColumbus then established a poorly located and short-lived settlement to the east, La Isabela ,  in the present-day Dominican Republic .  By the end of 1494, disease and famine had killed two-thirds of the Spanish settlers there.  \\n\nFrom April to August 1494, Columbus explored Cuba and Jamaica, then returned to Hispaniola.  Before leaving on this exploration to Cuba, Columbus had ordered a large amount of men, under Pedro Margarit, to \"journey the length and breadth of the island, enforcing Spanish control and bringing all the people under the Spanish yoke.\"  These men, in his absence, raped women, took men captive to be servants, and stole from the indigenous people. A number of Spanish were killed in retaliation.  By the time Columbus returned from exploring Cuba, the four primary leaders of the Arawak people in Hispaniola were gathering for war to try to drive the Spanish from the Island. Columbus assembled a large number of troops, and joined with his one native ally, chief [Guacanagarix], met for battle. The Spanish, even though they were largely outnumbered, won this battle, and over the next 9 months Columbus continued to wage war on the native Taino on Hispaniola until they surrendered and agreed to pay tribute.  \\n\nColumbus implemented encomienda ,   a Spanish labor system that rewarded conquerors with the labor of conquered non-Christian people.  It is also recorded that punishments to both Spaniards and natives included whippings and mutilation (cutting noses and ears).   \\n\nColumbus and the colonists enslaved many of the indigenous people,  including children.  Natives were beaten, raped, and tortured for the location of imagined gold.  Thousands committed suicide rather than face the oppression.  [ k ] \\n\nIn February 1495, Columbus rounded up about 1,500 Arawaks, some of whom had rebelled, in a great slave raid. About 500 of the strongest were shipped to Spain as slaves,  with about two hundred of those dying en route.   \\n\nIn June 1495, the Spanish crown sent ships and supplies to Hispaniola. In October, Florentine merchant Gianotto Berardi, who had won the contract to provision the fleet of Columbus\\'s second voyage and to supply the colony on Hispaniola, received almost 40,000 maravedís worth of enslaved Indians. He renewed his effort to get supplies to Columbus, and was working to organize a fleet when he suddenly died in December.  On 10 March 1496, having been away about 30 months,  the fleet departed La Isabela. On 8 June the crew sighted land somewhere between Lisbon and Cape St. Vincent , and disembarked in Cádiz on 11 June.  \\n\nOn 30 May 1498, Columbus left with six ships from Sanlúcar, Spain . The fleet called at Madeira and the Canary Islands, where it divided in two, with three ships heading for Hispaniola and the other three vessels, commanded by Columbus, sailing south to the Cape Verde Islands and then westward across the Atlantic. It is probable that this expedition was intended at least partly to confirm rumors of a large continent south of the Caribbean Sea, that is, South America.  \\n\nOn 31 July they sighted Trinidad ,  the most southerly of the Caribbean islands. On 5 August, Columbus sent several small boats ashore on the southern side of the Paria Peninsula in what is now Venezuela,   near the mouth of the Orinoco river.  This was the first recorded landing of Europeans on the mainland of South America,  which Columbus realized must be a continent.   The fleet then sailed to the islands of Chacachacare and Margarita , reaching the latter on 14 August,  and sighted Tobago and Grenada from afar, according to some scholars.   \\n\nOn 19 August, Columbus returned to Hispaniola. There he found settlers in rebellion against his rule, and his unfulfilled promises of riches. Columbus had some of the Europeans tried for their disobedience; at least one rebel leader was hanged.  \\n\nIn October 1499, Columbus sent two ships to Spain, asking the Court of Spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.  By this time, accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of Columbus had also reached the Court. The sovereigns sent Francisco de Bobadilla , a relative of Marquesa Beatriz de Bobadilla , a patron of Columbus and a close friend of Queen Isabella ,   to investigate the accusations of brutality made against the Admiral. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three Columbus brothers.  He moved into Columbus\\'s house and seized his property, took depositions from the Admiral\\'s enemies, and declared himself governor.  \\n\nBobadilla reported to Spain that Columbus once punished a man found guilty of stealing corn by having his ears and nose cut off and then selling him into slavery. He claimed that Columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern Hispaniola. [ l ] Testimony recorded in the report stated that Columbus congratulated his brother Bartholomew on \"defending the family\" when the latter ordered for a woman to be paraded naked through the streets and then had her tongue cut because she had \"spoken ill of the admiral and his brothers\".  The document also describes how Columbus put down native unrest and revolt: he first ordered a brutal suppression of the uprising in which many natives were killed, and then paraded their dismembered bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion.  Columbus vehemently denied the charges.   The neutrality and accuracy of the accusations and investigations of Bobadilla toward Columbus and his brothers have been disputed by historians, given the anti-Italian sentiment of the Spaniards and Bobadilla\\'s desire to take over Columbus\\'s position.    \\n\nIn early October 1500, Columbus and Diego presented themselves to Bobadilla, and were put in chains aboard La Gorda , the caravel on which Bobadilla had arrived at Santo Domingo.   They were returned to Spain, and languished in jail for six weeks before King Ferdinand ordered their release. Not long after, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to the Alhambra palace in Granada . The sovereigns expressed indignation at the actions of Bobadilla, who was then recalled and ordered to make restitutions of the property he had confiscated from Columbus.  The royal couple heard the brothers\\' pleas; restored their freedom and wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus\\'s fourth voyage.  However, Nicolás de Ovando was to replace Bobadilla and be the new governor of the West Indies .  \\n\nNew light was shed on the seizure of Columbus and his brother Bartholomew, the Adelantado , with the discovery by archivist Isabel Aguirre of an incomplete copy of the testimonies against them gathered by Francisco de Bobadilla at Santo Domingo in 1500. She found a manuscript copy of this pesquisa (inquiry) \\xe2\\x80\\x8cin the Archive of Simancas, Spain, uncatalogued until she and Consuelo Varela published their book, La caída de Cristóbal Colón: el juicio de Bobadilla ( The fall of Christopher Colón: the judgement of Bobadilla ) in 2006.   \\n\nOn 9 May 1502,  Columbus left Cádiz with his flagship Santa María and three other vessels. The ships were crewed by 140 men, including his brother Bartholomew as second in command and his son Fernando.  He sailed to Asilah on the Moroccan coast to rescue Portuguese soldiers said to be besieged by the Moors . The siege had been lifted by the time they arrived, so the Spaniards stayed only a day and continued on to the Canary Islands.  \\n\nOn 15 June, the fleet arrived at Martinique , where it lingered for several days. A hurricane was forming, so Columbus continued westward,  hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at Santo Domingo on 29 June, but was denied port, and the new governor Francisco de Bobadilla refused to listen to his warning that a hurricane was approaching. Instead, while Columbus\\'s ships sheltered at the mouth of the Rio Jaina, the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. Columbus\\'s ships survived with only minor damage, while 20 of the 30 ships in the governor\\'s fleet were lost along with 500 lives (including that of Francisco de Bobadilla). Although a few surviving ships managed to straggle back to Santo Domingo, Aguja , the fragile ship carrying Columbus\\'s personal belongings and his 4,000 pesos in gold was the sole vessel to reach Spain.   The gold was his tenth ( décimo ) of the profits from Hispaniola, equal to 240,000 maravedis,  guaranteed by the Catholic Monarchs in 1492.  \\n\nAfter a brief stop at Jamaica, Columbus sailed to Central America, arriving at the coast of Honduras on 30 July. Here Bartholomew found native merchants and a large canoe. On 14 August, Columbus landed on the continental mainland at Punta Caxinas, now Puerto Castilla, Honduras .  He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua , and Costa Rica , seeking a strait in the western Caribbean through which he could sail to the Indian Ocean. Sailing south along the Nicaraguan coast, he found a channel that led into Almirante Bay in Panama on 5 October.   \\n\nAs soon as his ships anchored in Almirante Bay, Columbus encountered Ng\\xc3 4be people in canoes who were wearing gold ornaments.  In January 1503, he established a garrison at the mouth of the Belén River . Columbus left for Hispaniola on 16 April. On 10 May he sighted the Cayman Islands , naming them \" Las Tortugas \" after the numerous sea turtles there.  His ships sustained damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel farther, on 25 June 1503 they were beached in Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica .  \\n\nFor six months Columbus and 230 of his men remained stranded on Jamaica. Diego Méndez de Segura, who had shipped out as a personal secretary to Columbus, and a Spanish shipmate called Bartolomé Flisco, along with six natives, paddled a canoe to get help from Hispaniola.  The governor, Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres , detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men.  In the meantime Columbus, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, won their favor by predicting a lunar eclipse for 29 February 1504 , using Abraham Zacuto \\'s astronomical charts.    Despite the governor\\'s obstruction, Christopher Columbus and his men were rescued on 28 June 1504, and arrived in Sanlúcar, Spain, on 7 November.  \\n\nLater life, illness, and death\nColumbus had always claimed that the conversion of non-believers was one reason for his explorations, and he grew increasingly religious in his later years.  Probably with the assistance of his son Diego and his friend the Carthusian monk Gaspar Gorricio, Columbus produced two books during his later years: a Book of Privileges (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the Spanish Crown to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a Book of Prophecies (1505), in which passages from the Bible were used to place his achievements as an explorer in the context of Christian eschatology .  \\n\nIn his later years, Columbus demanded that the Crown of Castile give him his tenth of all the riches and trade goods yielded by the new lands, as stipulated in the Capitulations of Santa Fe .  Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the Crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected. After his death, his heirs sued the Crown for a part of the profits from trade with America, as well as other rewards. This led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the pleitos colombinos (\"Columbian lawsuits\").  \\n\nDuring a violent storm on his first return voyage, Columbus, then 41, had suffered an attack of what was believed at the time to be gout . In subsequent years, he was plagued with what was thought to be influenza and other fevers, bleeding from the eyes, temporary blindness and prolonged attacks of gout. The attacks increased in duration and severity, sometimes leaving Columbus bedridden for months at a time, and culminated in his death 14 years later.\\n\nBased on Columbus\\'s lifestyle and the described symptoms, some modern commentators suspect that he suffered from reactive arthritis , rather than gout.   Reactive arthritis is a joint inflammation caused by intestinal bacterial infections or after acquiring certain sexually transmitted diseases (primarily chlamydia or gonorrhea ). In 2006, Frank C. Arnett, a medical doctor, and historian Charles Merrill, published their paper in The American Journal of the Medical Sciences proposing that Columbus had a form of reactive arthritis; Merrill made the case in that same paper that Columbus was the son of Catalans and his mother possibly a member of a prominent converso (converted Jew) family.  \"It seems likely that [Columbus] acquired reactive arthritis from food poisoning on one of his ocean voyages because of poor sanitation and improper food preparation\", says Arnett, a rheumatologist and professor of internal medicine, pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.  \\n\nSome historians such as H. Micheal Tarver and Emily Slape,  as well as medical doctors such as Arnett and Antonio Rodríguez Cuartero,  believe that Columbus had such a form of reactive arthritis, but according to other authorities, this is \"speculative\",  or \"very speculative\".  \\n\nAfter his arrival to Sanlúcar from his fourth voyage (and Queen Isabella\\'s death), an ill Columbus settled in Seville in April 1505. He stubbornly continued to make pleas to the Crown to defend his own personal privileges and his family\\'s.  He moved to Segovia (where the court was at the time) on a mule by early 1506,  and, on the occasion of the wedding of King Ferdinand with Germaine of Foix in Valladolid , Spain, in March 1506, Columbus moved to that city to persist with his demands.  On 20 May 1506, aged 54, Columbus died in Valladolid.  \\n\nLocation of remains\nColumbus\\'s remains were first buried at the Chapel of Wonders at the Convent of St. Francis, Valladolid ,  but were then moved to the monastery of La Cartuja in Seville (southern Spain) by the will of his son Diego.  They may have been exhumed in 1513 and interred at the Seville Cathedral . In about 1536, the remains of both Columbus and his son Diego were moved to a cathedral in Colonial Santo Domingo , in the present-day Dominican Republic ; Columbus had requested to be buried on the island.  By some accounts, in 1793, when France took over the entire island of Hispaniola, Columbus\\'s remains were moved to Havana , Cuba.   After Cuba became independent following the Spanish-American War in 1898, at least some of these remains were moved back to the Seville Cathedral,   where they were placed on an elaborate catafalque .\\n\nIn June 2003, DNA samples were taken from the remains in Seville, as well as those of Columbus\\'s brother Diego and younger son Fernando.  Initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to match Columbus\\'s physique or age at death.  DNA extraction proved difficult; only short fragments of mitochondrial DNA could be isolated. These matched corresponding DNA from Columbus\\'s brother, supporting that the two men had the same mother.  Such evidence, together with anthropologic and historic analyses, led the researchers to conclude that the remains belonged to Christopher Columbus.  [ m ] \\n\nIn 1877, a priest discovered a lead box at Santo Domingo inscribed: \"Discoverer of America, First Admiral\". Inscriptions found the next year read \"Last of the remains of the first admiral, Sire Christopher Columbus, discoverer.\"  The box contained bones of an arm and a leg, as well as a bullet. [ n ] These remains were considered legitimate by physician and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Eugene Osborne , who suggested in 1913 that they travel through the Panama Canal as a part of its opening ceremony.  [ o ] These remains were kept at the Basilica Cathedral of Santa María la Menor (in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo) before being moved to the Columbus Lighthouse ( Santo Domingo Este , inaugurated in 1992). The authorities in Santo Domingo have never allowed these remains to be DNA-tested, so it is unconfirmed whether they are from Columbus\\'s body as well.   [ p ] \\n\nCommemoration\nThe figure of Columbus was not ignored in the British colonies during the colonial era: Columbus became a unifying symbol early in the history of the colonies that became the United States when Puritan preachers began to use his life story as a model for a \"developing American spirit\".  In the spring of 1692, Puritan preacher Cotton Mather described Columbus\\'s voyage as one of three shaping events of the modern age, connecting Columbus\\'s voyage and the Puritans\\' migration to North America, seeing them together as the key to a grand design.  \\n\nThe use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations spread rapidly after the American Revolution. This was out of a desire to develop a national history and founding myth with fewer ties to Britain.    His name was the basis for the female national personification of the United States , Columbia ,  in use since the 1730s with reference to the original Thirteen Colonies , and also a historical name applied to the Americas and to the New World . Columbia, South Carolina and Columbia Rediviva , the ship for which the Columbia River was named, are named for Columbus.  \\n\nColumbus\\'s name was given to the newly born Republic of Colombia in the early 19th century, inspired by the political project of \"Colombeia\" developed by revolutionary Francisco de Miranda , which was put at the service of the emancipation of continental Hispanic America.  \\n\nTo commemorate the 400th anniversary of the landing of Columbus,  the 1893 World\\'s Fair in Chicago was named the World\\'s Columbian Exposition .  The U.S. Postal Service issued the first U.S. commemorative stamps , the Columbian Issue ,  depicting Columbus, Queen Isabella and others in various stages of his several voyages.  The policies related to the celebration of the Spanish colonial empire as the vehicle of a nationalist project undertaken in Spain during the Restoration in the late 19th century took form with the commemoration of the 4th centenary on 12 October 1892 (in which the figure of Columbus was extolled by the Conservative government), eventually becoming the very same national day.  Several monuments commemorating the \"discovery\" were erected in cities such as Palos, Barcelona, Granada, Madrid, Salamanca, Valladolid and Seville in the years around the 400th anniversary.  [ q ] \\n\nFor the Columbus Quincentenary in 1992, a second Columbian issue was released jointly with Italy, Portugal, and Spain.  Columbus was celebrated at Seville Expo \\'92 , and Genoa Expo \\'92 .\\n\nThe Boal Mansion Museum, founded in 1951, contains a collection of materials concerning later descendants of Columbus and collateral branches of the family. It features a 16th-century chapel from a Spanish castle reputedly owned by Diego Colón which became the residence of Columbus\\'s descendants. The chapel interior was dismantled and moved from Spain in 1909 and re-erected on the Boal estate at Boalsburg , Pennsylvania. Inside it are numerous religious paintings and other objects including a reliquary with fragments of wood supposedly from the True Cross . The museum also holds a collection of documents mostly relating to Columbus descendants of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  \\n\nIn many countries of the Americas, as well as Spain and Italy, Columbus Day celebrates the anniversary of Columbus\\'s arrival in the Americas on 12 October 1492.  \\n\nLegacy\nThe voyages of Columbus are considered a turning point in human history,  marking the beginning of globalization and accompanying demographic, commercial, economic, social, and political changes.  \\n\nHis explorations resulted in permanent contact between the two hemispheres, and the term \" pre-Columbian \" is used to refer to the cultures of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus and his European successors.  The ensuing Columbian exchange saw the massive exchange of animals, plants, fungi, diseases, technologies, mineral wealth and ideas.  \\n\nIn the first century after his endeavors, Columbus\\'s figure largely languished in the backwaters of history, and his reputation was beset by his failures as a colonial administrator. His legacy was somewhat rescued from oblivion when he began to appear as a character in Italian and Spanish plays and poems from the late 16th century onward.  \\n\nColumbus was subsumed into the Western narrative of colonization and empire building, which invoked notions of translatio imperii and translatio studii to underline who was considered \"civilized\" and who was not.  \\n\nThe Americanization of the figure of Columbus began in the latter decades of the 18th century, after the revolutionary period of the United States,  elevating the status of his reputation to a national myth, homo americanus .  His landing became a powerful icon as an \"image of American genesis\".  The Discovery of America sculpture, depicting Columbus and a cowering Native maiden, was commissioned on 3 April 1837, when U.S. President Martin Van Buren sanctioned the engineering of Luigi Persico \\'s design. This representation of Columbus\\'s triumph and the Native\\'s recoil is a demonstration of supposed white superiority over savage, naive Natives.  As recorded during its unveiling in 1844, the sculpture extends to \"represent the meeting of the two races\", as Persico captures their first interaction, highlighting the \"moral and intellectual inferiority\" of Natives.  Placed outside the U.S. Capitol building where it remained until its removal in the mid-20th century, the sculpture reflected the contemporary view of whites in the U.S. toward the Natives; they are labeled \"merciless Indian savages\" in the United States Declaration of Independence .  In 1836, Pennsylvania senator and future U.S. President James Buchanan , who proposed the sculpture, described it as representing \"the great discoverer when he first bounded with ecstasy upon the shore, ail his toils past, presenting a hemisphere to the astonished world, with the name America inscribed upon it. Whilst he is thus standing upon the shore, a female savage, with awe and wonder depicted in her countenance, is gazing upon him.\"  \\n\nThe American Columbus myth was reconfigured later in the century when he was enlisted as an ethnic hero by immigrants to the United States who were not of Anglo-Saxon stock, such as Jewish, Italian, and Irish people, who claimed Columbus as a sort of ethnic founding father.   Catholics unsuccessfully tried to promote him for canonization in the 19th century.   \\n\nFrom the 1990s onward, a narrative of Columbus being responsible for the genocide of indigenous peoples and environmental destruction began to compete with the then predominant discourse of Columbus as Christ-bearer, scientist, or father of America.  This narrative features the negative effects of Columbus\\' conquests on native populations.  Exposed to Old World diseases, the indigenous populations of the New World collapsed,  and were largely replaced by Europeans and Africans,  who brought with them new methods of farming, business, governance, and religious worship.\\n\nThough Christopher Columbus came to be considered the European discoverer of America in Western popular culture, his historical legacy is more nuanced.  After settling Iceland, the Norse settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century.  Norsemen are believed to have then set sail from Greenland and Iceland to become the first known Europeans to reach the North American mainland, nearly 500 years before Columbus reached the Caribbean.  The 1960s discovery of a Norse settlement dating to c. 1000 AD at L\\'Anse aux Meadows , Newfoundland , partially corroborates accounts within the Icelandic sagas of Erik the Red \\'s colonization of Greenland and his son Leif Erikson \\'s subsequent exploration of a place he called Vinland .  \\n\nIn the 19th century, amid a revival of interest in Norse culture , Carl Christian Rafn and Benjamin Franklin DeCosta wrote works establishing that the Norse had preceded Columbus in colonizing the Americas.   Following this, in 1874 Rasmus Bj\\xc3\\xb8rn Anderson argued that Columbus must have known of the North American continent before he started his voyage of discovery.   Most modern scholars doubt Columbus had knowledge of the Norse settlements in America, with his arrival to the continent being most likely an independent discovery .      \\n\nEuropeans devised explanations for the origins of the Native Americans and their geographical distribution with narratives that often served to reinforce their own preconceptions built on ancient intellectual foundations.  In modern Latin America, the non-Native populations of some countries often demonstrate an ambiguous attitude toward the perspectives of indigenous peoples regarding the so-called \"discovery\" by Columbus and the era of colonialism that followed.  \\nIn his 1960 monograph , Mexican philosopher and historian Edmundo O\\'Gorman explicitly rejects the Columbus discovery myth, arguing that the idea that Columbus discovered America was a misleading legend fixed in the public mind through the works of American author Washington Irving during the 19th century. O\\'Gorman argues that to assert Columbus \"discovered America\" is to shape the facts concerning the events of 1492 to make them conform to an interpretation that arose many years later.  For him, the Eurocentric view of the discovery of America sustains systems of domination in ways that favor Europeans.  In a 1992 article for The UNESCO Courier , Félix Fernández-Shaw argues that the word \"discovery\" prioritizes European explorers as the \"heroes\" of the contact between the Old and New World. He suggests that the word \"encounter\" is more appropriate, being a more universal term which includes Native Americans in the narrative.  \\n\nHistorians have traditionally argued that Columbus remained convinced until his death that his journeys had been along the east coast of Asia as he originally intended   (excluding arguments such as Anderson\\'s).  On his third voyage he briefly referred to South America as a \"hitherto unknown\" continent, [ f ] while also rationalizing that it was the Earthly Paradise (Eden) located \"at the end of the Orient \".  Columbus continued to claim in his later writings that he had reached Asia; in a 1502 letter to Pope Alexander VI , he asserts that Cuba is the east coast of Asia.  On the other hand, in a document in the Book of Privileges (1502), Columbus refers to the New World as the Indias Occidentales (\\'West Indies\\'), which he says \"were unknown to all the world\".  \\n\nWashington Irving\\'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many Catholic theologians insisted that the Earth was flat ,  but this is a popular misconception which can be traced back to 17th-century Protestants campaigning against Catholicism.  In fact, the spherical shape of the Earth had been known to scholars since antiquity, and was common knowledge among sailors, including Columbus.  Coincidentally, the oldest surviving globe of the Earth, the Erdapfel , was made in 1492, just before Columbus\\'s return to Europe from his first voyage. As such it contains no sign of the Americas and yet demonstrates the common belief in a spherical Earth.  \\n\nIn 1492, Columbus correctly measured Polaris \\'s diurnal motion around true north as having a diameter of almost 7°.  In 1498, while sailing west through the doldrums 8° north in July and again in August sailing the trade winds 13° north, Columbus reported seeing Polaris with a diurnal motion of 10° in diameter. He accounted for the shift by concluding that Earth\\'s figure is pear-shaped , with the \\'stalk\\' portion (comparing this to a woman\\'s breast ) being nearest Heaven and upon which was centered the Earthly Paradise.    Although Columbus\\'s later readings were incorrect, 20th-century satellite data happens to indicate that the Earth has a slight pear shape.    \\n\nColumbus has been criticized both for his brutality and for initiating the depopulation of the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, whether by imported diseases or intentional violence. According to scholars of Native American history, George Tinker and Mark Freedman, Columbus was responsible for creating a cycle of \"murder, violence, and slavery\" to maximize exploitation of the Caribbean islands\\' resources, and that Native deaths on the scale at which they occurred would not have been caused by new diseases alone. Further, they describe the proposition that disease and not genocide caused these deaths as \"American holocaust denial \".  Historian Kris Lane disputes whether it is appropriate to use the term \"genocide\" when the atrocities were not Columbus\\'s intent, but resulted from his decrees, family business goals, and negligence.  Other scholars defend Columbus\\'s actions or allege that the worst accusations against him are not based in fact while others claim that \"he has been blamed for events far beyond his own reach or knowledge\".  \\n\nAs a result of the protests and riots that followed the murder of George Floyd in 2020, many public monuments of Christopher Columbus have been removed .  \\n\nSome historians have criticized Columbus for initiating the widespread colonization of the Americas and for abusing its native population.     On St. Croix , Columbus\\'s friend Michele da Cuneo\\xe2\\x80\\x94according to his own account\\xe2\\x80\\x94kept an indigenous woman he captured, whom Columbus \"gave to [him]\", then brutally raped her.  [ r ] [ s ] \\n\nAccording to some historians, the punishment for an indigenous person, aged 14 and older, failing to pay a hawk\\'s bell, or cascabela ,  worth of gold dust every six months (based on Bartolomé de las Casas \\'s account) was cutting off the hands of those without tokens, often leaving them to bleed to death.    Other historians dispute such accounts. For example, a study of Spanish archival sources showed that the cascabela quotas were imposed by Guarionex , not Columbus, and that there is no mention, in the primary sources, of punishment by cutting off hands for failing to pay.  Columbus had an economic interest in the enslavement of the Hispaniola natives and for that reason was not eager to baptize them, which attracted criticism from some churchmen.  Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian, stated that \"Columbus\\'s government was characterized by a form of tyranny. Even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place.\"  Other historians have argued that some of the accounts of the brutality of Columbus and his brothers have been exaggerated as part of the Black Legend , a historical tendency towards anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic sentiment in historical sources dating as far back as the 16th century, which they speculate may continue to taint scholarship into the present day.    \\n\nAccording to historian Emily Berquist Soule, the immense Portuguese profits from the maritime trade in African slaves along the West African coast served as an inspiration for Columbus to create a counterpart of this apparatus in the New World using indigenous American slaves.  Historian William J. Connell has argued that while Columbus \"brought the entrepreneurial form of slavery to the New World\", this \"was a phenomenon of the times\", further arguing that \"we have to be very careful about applying 20th-century understandings of morality to the morality of the 15th century.\"  In a less popular defense of colonization, Spanish ambassador María Jesús Figa [ es ] has argued, \"Normally we melded with the cultures in America, we stayed there, we spread our language and culture and religion.\"  \\n\nBritish historian Basil Davidson has dubbed Columbus the \"father of the slave trade \",   citing the fact that the first license to ship enslaved Africans to the Caribbean was issued by the Catholic Monarchs in 1501 to the first royal governor of Hispaniola, Nicolás de Ovando .  \\n\nAround the turn of the 21st century, estimates for the pre-Columbian population of Hispaniola ranged between 250,000 and two million,    [ t ] but genetic analysis published in late 2020 suggests that smaller figures are more likely, perhaps as low as 10,000-50,000 for Hispaniola and Puerto Rico combined.   Based on the previous figures of a few hundred thousand, some have estimated that a third or more of the natives in Haiti were dead within the first two years of Columbus\\'s governorship.   Contributors to depopulation included disease, warfare, and harsh enslavement.   Indirect evidence suggests that some serious illness may have arrived with the 1,500 colonists who accompanied Columbus\\' second expedition in 1493.  Charles C. Mann writes that \"It was as if the suffering these diseases had caused in Eurasia over the past millennia were concentrated into the span of decades.\"  A third of the natives forced to work in gold and silver mines died every six months.   Within three to six decades, the surviving Arawak population numbered only in the hundreds.    The indigenous population of the Americas overall is thought to have been reduced by about 90% in the century after Columbus\\'s arrival.  Among indigenous peoples, Columbus is often viewed as a key agent of genocide.  Samuel Eliot Morison , a Harvard University historian and author of a multivolume biography on Columbus, writes, \"The cruel policy initiated by Columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide.\"  \\n\nAccording to Noble David Cook, \"There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact.\" He instead estimates that the death toll was caused by smallpox ,  which may have caused a pandemic only after the arrival of Hernán Cortés in 1519.    According to some estimates, smallpox had an 80-90% fatality rate in Native American populations.  The natives had no acquired immunity to these new diseases and suffered high fatalities. There is also evidence that they had poor diets and were overworked.    Historian Andrés Reséndez of University of California, Davis , says the available evidence suggests \"slavery has emerged as major killer\" of the indigenous populations of the Caribbean between 1492 and 1550 more so than diseases such as smallpox, influenza and malaria.  He says that indigenous populations did not experience a rebound like European populations did following the Black Death because unlike the latter, a large portion of the former were subjected to deadly forced labor in the mines.  \\n\nThe diseases that devastated the Native Americans came in multiple waves at different times, sometimes as much as centuries apart, which would mean that survivors of one disease may have been killed by others, preventing the population from recovering.  Historian David Stannard describes the depopulation of the indigenous Americans as \"neither inadvertent nor inevitable\", saying it was the result of both disease and intentional genocide.  \\n\nBiographers and historians have a wide range of opinions about Columbus\\'s expertise and experience navigating and captaining ships. One scholar lists some European works ranging from the 1890s to 1980s that support Columbus\\'s experience and skill as among the best in Genoa, while listing some American works over a similar timeframe that portray the explorer as an untrained entrepreneur, having only minor crew or passenger experience prior to his noted journeys.  According to Morison, Columbus\\'s success in utilizing the trade winds might owe significantly to luck.  \\n\nPhysical appearance\nContemporary descriptions of Columbus, including those by his son Fernando and Bartolomé de las Casas, describe him as taller than average, with light skin (often sunburnt), blue or hazel eyes, high cheekbones and freckled face, an aquiline nose , and blond to reddish hair and beard (until about the age of 30, when it began to whiten).   One Spanish commentator described his eyes using the word garzos , now usually translated as \"light blue\", but it seems to have indicated light grey-green or hazel eyes to Columbus\\'s contemporaries. The word rubios can mean \"blond\", \"fair\", or \"ruddy\".  Although an abundance of artwork depicts Columbus, no authentic contemporary portrait is known.  \\n\nA well-known image of Columbus is a portrait by Sebastiano del Piombo , which has been reproduced in many textbooks. It agrees with descriptions of Columbus in that it shows a large man with auburn hair, but the painting dates from 1519 so cannot have been painted from life. Furthermore, the inscription identifying the subject as Columbus was probably added later, and the face shown differs from that of other images.  \\n\nSometime between 1531 and 1536, Alejo Fernández painted an altarpiece, The Virgin of the Navigators , that includes a depiction of Columbus.  The painting was commissioned for a chapel in Seville\\'s Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) in the Alcázar of Seville and remains there.  \\n\nAt the World\\'s Columbian Exposition in 1893, 71 alleged portraits of Columbus were displayed; most of them did not match contemporary descriptions.  \\n\nSee also\nNotes\nWhile I was in the boat, I captured a very beautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral gave to me. When I had taken her to my cabin she was naked\\xe2\\x80\\x94as was their custom. I was filled with a desire to take my pleasure with her and attempted to satisfy my desire. She was unwilling, and so treated me with her nails that I wished I had never begun. But\\xe2\\x80\\x94to cut a long story short\\xe2\\x80\\x94I then took a piece of rope and whipped her soundly, and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears. Eventually we came to such terms, I assure you, that you would have thought that she had been brought up in a school for whores. \nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

In 1896, state architect Pedro Cobreros , who designed other churches in Puerto Rico , reconstructed its facade and enlarged the interior.  \\n\nThe church differs from others in Puerto Rico because it is not related to a municipality\\'s urban center . When first built it was the parish church of Villa de Cangrejos but, as the metropolitan area expanded, Santurce was absorbed into San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico . The building is located at the highest elevation of Santurce, which allows for a view of Santurce,  now a barrio of San Juan.\\n\nIts large facade has two towers with three stories in between. This feature is known as westwork ; (a west-facing entrance with towers, a vestibule, and a chapel). However, in the case of this church, its main entrance faces south. Curved steps lead up to the main entrance. The church, oriented from north to south, deviates from the traditional east to west orientation. On the west side of the church is a small parish house built in the same style as the church. The buildings are separated by a fence and a garden.\\n\nThe interior main floor follows the basilica form with two lateral naves which are divided by means of an arcade of six bays resting on pillars. Each bay has a small rectangular window.\\n\nOriginally, the nave had a flat wooden roof which has been replaced by one of exposed beams of concrete. The square apse is roofed with a dome that rests on pendentives .\\n\nThe floors are made of marble and have been placed diagonally from the main axis. The church had a choir floor which no longer exists and had four portholes , now closed, to illuminate the altar.\\n\nThe building has retained its original character. The two main changes since its original construction have been the expansion of the sacristy and the installation of an air conditioning system.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

She called the five ideas the \"emblematic\" projects of her administration and dubbed the overall plan \"Ponce Avanza\" (Ponce Moves Forward). The original plan judged the initial cost of the Ciudad Deportiva at $4.5 million initially.  In 2010, the mayor\\'s plan for Ciudad Deportiva was presented before the Puerto Rico Senate . In early 2012 the first payment of $1,050,000 was made to CGC Builders to start construction work.  \\n\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the complex is to \"provide ... sports facilities in the city of Ponce for the celebration of sporting events lasting more than one day\".  \\n\nFunding\nIn February 2012, the sports campus has an initial projected total cost of $20 million USD .  The municipality has secured US$6.3 million to start construction.  In January 2012, the municipality of Ponce adjudicated US$1.05 million to GCG Builders to level the ground to commence the first phase of construction.  This was revised in May 2012 to $32.3 million USD .  \\n\nConstruction phases\nThe Sports City will be developed in phases. Phase I will include construction of the three tennis courts and an area for extreme sports , including skateboarding . Phase II will encompass the baseball field, the track and field area, soccer field, and the central plaza. A future phase yet would include the soccer stadium.  The skateboarding facility opened on 23 March 2013.  By October 2013, building of the soccer field  had already started.  \\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°00\\xe2\\x80\\xb213\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°35\\xe2\\x80\\xb205\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.00363°N 66.58462°W ﻿ / 18.00363; -66.58462 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCentral Coloso\n\\n\nCentral Coloso , also known as Coloso Sugar Cane Refinery , was a long-running sugarcane refinery in Aguada , Puerto Rico . The refinery was established in late 19th century becoming one of the biggest sugar emporiums in the island. It remained operational until 2003, becoming the last sugarcane refinery to cease operations on the island.\\n\nHistory\nThe Coloso origins begin in the 19th century, specifically towards the end of the 1820s when the Caño de las Nasas estate was founded in Aguada . That estate functioned with a cattle-operated sugar mill producing approximately 100 sugar barrels a day.\\n\nIn the late 1860s, Emilio Vadí acquired the estate and changed its name to Coloso. In 1875, he changed it into sugar cane refinery.\\n\nUpon turning Coloso into a sugarcane refinery, Emilio Vadí mechanized most of the production process. As a result, he produced 1,000 sugar barrels a day. That name increased during the 1870s.\\n\nIn 1879, Vadí made a partnership with German entrepreneur H. Kuster. Still, due to high debts and the crisis in the sugarcane industry in the late 19th century, Kuster & Vadí sold Coloso to José Arnell Massó in 1897. After buying Central Coloso, Arnell Massó consolidated it with other refinery and sugar mills he had acquired between 1885 and 1895. He also transported the machinery from one of those refineries, Central Monserrate, to Coloso.\\n\nAs a result of this, Central Coloso ended up covering 4,370 acres, of which approximately 500 were cultivated annually. Coloso also processed sugar that other farmers grew. In 1902, a total of 20,000 sugar sacks were processed. During the peak crop time, workers at Coloso reached 1,500.\\n\nIn 1904, French investors acquired Coloso and incorporated it under the name of Sucrerie Centrale Coloso de Porto Rico . In 1915, it was bought by West Puerto Rico Sugar Company . In 1921, it became Central Coloso, Inc. At this point, it had around 291 acres. During the next decades, Coloso continued a program of expansion and modernization. In 1952, Coloso had a milling capacity of 5,000 tons of sugar daily. That year, sugar production peaked in the island. In 1961, Coloso reached the highest sugar production tonnage at 73,554 tons.\\n\nThe sugar industry started struggling towards the middle of the 20th century due to several reasons: high cost of production, declining sale prices, credit restrictions, and strikes among workers. Another factor was the industrialization of the island, which caused the shift of the local economy to move away from agriculture.\\n\nCentral Coloso continued to be administered as a private industry until 1972 when the Government of Puerto Rico leased it as part of a program to rehabilitate the sugarcane industry. In 1976, the government acquired Central Coloso through the Corporación Azucarera de Puerto Rico . This agency was created with the purpose of developing, improving, and intensifying the industry.\\n\nDuring the 1980s, most of the sugar mills and refineries in the island had ceased operations, but Coloso maintained a considerable production tonnage. In 1986, sugarcane production was handed down to private companies.\\n\nIn the 1990s, the government started implementing a program of privatization of the Corporación Azucarera . In 1998, Coloso became the last operating sugarcane refinery in the island when Central Roig in Yabucoa ceased operations.

Along with the Catedral Santiago Apóstol in Fajardo it is the seat of the Diocese of Fajardo-Humacao .  \\n\nHistory\nThe first church for the parish of Dulce Nombre de Jesús was a simple structure built in 1769.  A second church was built from 1825 to 1826.  It was in a ruinous state by 1860 and the present church was built between 1868 and 1877.  It was designed by Don Evaristo de Churruca in the Gothic Revival style.  The bell tower collapsed as the result of an earthquake in 1918 .  The church was repaired in 1928 and another renovation took place in the 1980s. Dulce Nombre de Jes\\xcf\\x8ds became a cathedral church when Pope Benedict XVI established the Diocese of Fajardo-Humacao on March 11, 2008.  The church was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984, using the name style Church Dulce Nombre de Jesús of Humacao .  It was later listed on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones on May 16, 2001.  \\n\nArchitecture\nThe cathedral is on the east side of the town plaza.  A low concrete wall with metal grillwork surrounds the church building.  The wall is modulated by pillars that hold cast iron lamps.

The main fa\\xc3 7ade is dominated by a four-level square bell tower topped with a spire .  It is flanked by two smaller round towers that house a spiral staircase and the weights for the clock. All the windows and doorways are framed with moldings.  Small buttresses flank pointed arch windows on the sides of the building.  The two-level transept is crowned with a gabled roof.  Each side has two pointed-arch windows on the first level and round window in the second.\\n\nOn the interior horizontal moldings have been eliminated to give the illusion of a taller structure.  Pillars separate the nave from the side aisles, and they are assembled into five bays on each side.  The main nave is covered by a pointed vault and the side naves are covered by groin vaults .  Four pairs of small pointed arch windows are above the side aisles.  There is a dome over the crossing, but it is covered by acoustic tiles and cannot be seen.  The apse is covered by a groined half-dome and contains stained glass windows .  The floor is covered with colored native cement tiles and a new choir loft is in the rear of the church.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

It is one of the forty subbarrios of Santurce in San Juan, Puerto Rico .\\n\nSetting\nCondado is an upscale neighborhood located on the beach .  It is located east of the historic colonial barrio of Old San Juan . It is one of 40 subbarrios of Santurce. The land area measures 203.81 acres (82.48 ha ) with a resident population of 6,170 according to the 2000 United States Census .\\n\nThe eastern border is marked by De Diego Avenue and its straight extension towards the Atlantic coast. On the south, the subbarrio is bounded by Wilson Street, Aldea Street, Expreso Baldorioty de Castro, Piccioni Street and Delcasse Street, and by the Condado Lagoon (from east to west). At the westernmost point is the Dos Hermanos Bridge , where Ashford Avenue ends and leads into Old San Juan. In the north are the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean next to hotels and other attractions such as nightclubs, casinos, shops and restaurants. Condado is one of the island\\'s primary tourist destinations.\\n\nIn recent years, El Condado neighborhood has become associated with wealth and status. Properties are scarce, hard to come by and extremely expensive. It is sometimes called the \"Manhattan of Puerto Rico\" and properties tend to hover in the millions of dollars. It is one of the most desirable places to live on the island and as such commands a premium.\\n\nCondado began its process of urbanization in 1908 by two American industrialists, Hernan and Sosthenes , also known as the Behn Brothers. The quarter became a typical streetcar suburb to the traditional urban center of Old San Juan. Its growth and development was mostly shaped by a transportation influenced suburbanization developed on a grid plan .\\n\nThe neighborhood experienced an economic boom in the first decades of the 20th century when some of the wealthiest families built their homes in the area. The Vanderbilts built a summer home in 1919 which today has been converted into the luxurious Condado Vanderbilt Hotel . The Behn Brothers also built their home in Condado and to their memory, Dos Hermanos Bridge (or \"Two Brothers Bridge\" in English) is named in their honor as founders of Puerto Rico Telephone and the new electric tramway line that linked the county to Old San Juan.\\n\nThe 1950s-60s era saw another boom in Condado, with the rapid industrialization of Puerto Rico , this flamboyant locale was becoming a popular tourist destination. Large hotels like the Caribe Hilton Hotel and La Concha Resort were built as part of a government sponsorship program under the Operation Bootstrap brand.\\n\nA convention center was built to host activities while many families began to move in during the development of high-end and high-rise apartment buildings. In fact, Ashford Avenue was named after another well-known Condado resident Dr. Bailey Ashford . It runs through the subbarrio and leads toward the Puente Dos Hermanos.  \\n\nDemographics\nIn 2010, Condado had a population of 4,908 and a population density of 15,832.3 persons per square mile.\\n \\n\nCondado looks quite different from what it did at the turn of the century. Some of the luxurious homes which still remain nestled between the high-rise condominiums have been converted into small inns, shops, museums or restaurants.  Dr. Bailey Ashford \\'s home has been remodeled and there are plans to turn it into a museum. Condado\\'s main public space is La Ventana al Mar , designed by architect and urbanist Andrés Mignucci . The park is flanked by two of Condado\\'s landmark hotels: to the west by the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel (1919), designed by Warren and Whitmore, and to the east by the La Concha Hotel (1957), designed by Toro Ferrer .\\n\nOne of the first schools constructed by the United States is in Condado. Designed by Antonin Nechodoma , it was designated as a historic site in November 2020 by the Puerto Rico Planning Board .  \\n\nCondado is served by the Puerto Rico Metropolitan Bus Authority with two bus routes: T21  and D53 .   \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.  The hotel was designed by the architectural firm Warren and Wetmore , who also designed New York \\'s Grand Central Terminal . It was built by the Vanderbilt family and it marked the beginning of high end tourism in Puerto Rico .  \\n\nHistory\nConstruction of the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel was begun in 1917 by Frederick William Vanderbilt , the son of William Henry Vanderbilt .  He selected the prominent architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore , which had designed New York City\\'s Grand Central Terminal , as well as the Biltmore, Commodore, and Ambassador Hotels. On 16 October 1919, the hotel, having cost a million dollars to construct, was inaugurated.    It was suggested that the early Spanish Revival style architecture be used by Fredrick Vanderbilt.  Capitalizing on the property\\'s setting adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, the designers created a  Beaux Arts-style structure with white walls, red tiles, French windows, lofty ceilings and other design details typical of the style at the time. The original roofing featured antique Spanish tiles sourced from Puerto Rico\\'s older Spanish buildings. The floors and the public areas including the main staircase were decorated with marble and mosaics and the area between the ocean and the hotel building was developed to help the building withstand damage from the Atlantic coast. The hotel also featured a flagstone paved terrace.  Giant pandanus , several kinds of bougainvillea , fruit trees and coconut palms could also be found in the hotel\\'s gardens.  \\n\nThe Condado Vanderbilt was the first luxury hotel to open in Puerto Rico and was also the first hotel in Puerto Rico to have a casino after gambling was legalized in 1940.    Among the famous guests to have stayed at the Condado Vanderbilt are the former Presidents of the United States John F. Kennedy and Franklin Roosevelt and Roosevelt\\'s wife Eleanor ,  the American aviator Charles Lindbergh ,  composer José Luis Moneró ,  singer-songwriter Carlos Gardel , Hollywood actor Errol Flynn , comedian Bob Hope , and pianist Arthur Rubinstein .  Activities that were available included American golf, tennis and motoring among other things. These were advertised in various American newspapers during the 1920s.  \\n\nManuel Gonzalez bought the hotel from the Vanderbilts during The Great Depression in 1930,  and changed its name to the Condado Hotel .  In the 1940s, the hotel\\'s East Wing was built, a five-story L-shaped addition, containing additional guest rooms and public areas.  In the 1950s, after a series of changes in ownership, the name was changed to the Condado Beach Hotel .  In 1962, another addition was built on the other side of the hotel, the West Wing, a nine-story concrete structure containing 156 air-conditioned guest rooms, all facing the sea.  \\n\nIn the early 1970s, with the hotel threatened with demolition, governor Luis A. Ferré issued an executive order, declaring the structure a cultural heritage site.  In 1973, the Condado Beach Hotel was united with the adjacent La Concha Hotel into one resort, known as the Hyatt Puerto Rico .  The 1940s East Wing of the Condado Beach Hotel was demolished in 1975 and a huge convention wing was built in its place, joining the Condado Beach and La Concha Hotels into one physical complex. In 1976,  with construction complete, management of the complex was taken over by Hilton International  and it was renamed the Condado Beach La Concha Convention Center .  Management later transferred to Carnival Cruise Line ,  which renamed the resort The Condado Beach Trio . The La Concha Hotel wing closed in 1995 and the state-owned hotel was known in its final years as The Condado Beach Hotel & Casino , before the entire complex closed on June 30, 1997,  as it was losing $7 million a year.  The properties sat vacant for many years, and the La Concha and Condado Beach Hotels were finally severed in 2004. The convention center that joined them was demolished to build a public park.  \\n\nIn 1997, the administration of Pedro Rosselló proposed that the Condado area be redeveloped. Brian McLaughlin suggested renovating and expanding the hotel, but then-San Juan mayor Sila M. Calderon challenged the proposal in court. This led to the hotel being abandoned until 2002 when she finally agreed.   Having been abandoned for seven years, the hotel\\'s renovation was finally undertaken at a cost of US$270 million in 2003.  The goal was to transform it into a five-star hotel with resemblance to the original 1919 structure. The 1962 West Wing was demolished in 2003, in preparation for this work.  The remaining original 1919 central hotel structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.  \\n\nOn 16 October 2012, after ten years and 53,441 hours of renovations, two years longer than originally planned, a part of the renovated hotel comprising several new banquet halls, bars and restaurants was finally opened for business.  On December 1, 2014,  the newly built 11-story twin towers on either side of the central structure were opened.  The renovated rooms are 17 feet wide with high ceilings.  The bathrooms have double sinks and both a shower and tub. The original staircases, however, remain in place. The remodeling was handled by a team led by Hugh Andrews and Jorge Rossello.  \\n\nAmong the newly built restaurants, \"1919\", \"Tacos & Tequila by Patron\", \"Veritas\", \"Marabar\" and \"Avo Lounge\"; \"1919\" has been credited as \"Puerto Rico\\'s finest restaurant\" by Turismo, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company.  \\n\nIn Popular culture\nThe hotel was one of the main filming locations of the 1976 teen comedy musical, La Pandilla en Apuros .  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

The conservatory was originally envisioned as a school for preparing musicians for the PRSO and for preparing music teachers for the state public education system. Throughout the years, however, the conservatory has become a musical landmark in the Caribbean, providing advanced academic studies in various music areas to local students as well as international visitors.\\n\nSince its inception, the conservatory has been under the administration of state government agencies, including the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company ( Compañía de Fomento Económico ), the Administration for the Encouragement of Arts and Culture ( Administración para el Fomento de las Artes y Cultura ), and the Musical Arts Corporation ( Corporación de las Artes Musicales , or CAM). It remained a part of the CAM until 1995 when a state law granted it fiscal and administrative autonomy. Since then, the conservatory has been autonomously run by a board of trustees appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate.\\n\nAcademics\nThe conservatory offers a variety of post-secondary degrees in music, the post-graduate program offers bachelor\\'s degrees in: musical composition , music education , voice , classical guitar , symphony instruments, jazz , Caribbean music , and piano .

It houses a tourist center at its base, a ten-story vertical tower, and a horizontal sky bridge that has panoramic views of the city of Ponce and the Caribbean Sea . Visitors can reach the skybridge via glass elevators or a staircase. Made of reinforced concrete, the cross has withstood various natural disasters, including three major hurricanes . The arms of the cross measure 70 feet. It was inaugurated in 1984.  \\n\nOne of many landmarks of the city of Ponce, the cross is owned by the Municipality of Ponce and is currently operated by the \"Patronato de Ponce\", a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving the city\\'s cultural heritage.  [ a ] It is visited annually by some 100,000 tourists.  \\n\nHistorical background\nThe cross sits at the same spot on Cerro del Vigía where early settlers once looked out for merchant ships and would-be invaders, including marauding pirates. In 1801, the settlers built a much smaller cross made of two intersecting tree trunks where an observer would constantly watch the sea and the city\\'s port, raising different flags to either notify local merchants of incoming trade ships or alert military authorities of possible threats (a replica of this wooden cross now sits behind the current monument). Originally a hut was built accompanied by a cross from where flags were raised to signal the approach of ships as well as their port of origin. This station was run by two brothers Ricardo and Alberto Lugo, they were honored with a plaque at the base of the cross in 1984. They are descendants of Alonso Fernández de Lugo last conquistador of Spain.  \\n\nOne of the best remembered watchmen was named Luis Castro. Nearly 200 years ago, Luis would sit atop a huge wooden cross on this hill. On the lookout for ocean vessels, it was his responsibility to determine the nationality of approaching ships. If he recognized the vessel he would raise a flag, but if a ship was thought to be carrying contraband then no flag was raised and the Spanish military would investigate.  The Cruceta was built in honor of Castro and all the other watchmen who so faithfully helped protect the city during its younger years.  \\n\nThe Cerro del Vigía also served as a refugee camp for citizens during the storm of 12 September 1738, the earthquake of 10 May 1787 , the tsunami of 18 November 1867, and the American invasion of 25 July 1898.  \\n\nJapanese Garden\nIn recent years, a Japanese Garden was built in the grounds nearby the Cruceta. The garden is located in a 2,223 square meter ground. Its purpose is to encourage spiritual peace and harmony by the means of nature and Zen music. The garden features small lakes, rivers, bonsais , and bridges.\\n\nGallery\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°01\\xe2\\x80\\xb208.35\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°37\\xe2\\x80\\xb212.66\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.0189861°N 66.6201833°W ﻿ / 18.0189861; -66.6201833 \\n"

Martínez pushed for designating the cave system as a national park system.  \\nThere are 60 caves in the Cabachuelas zone which was declared a natural reserve on February 29, 2012, with the signing of law 129 by then governor, Luis Fortuño .  Since then a process of identifying the land around the cave system-what needed to be purchased from private owners began, and it was decided that there were 16 privately owned properties which should become part of the reserve.  In February 2019 the park opened to the public. Guided tours for groups of up to 15 people are coordinated by CABACOOP, Proyecto Cabachuelas.\\n\nFuture plans\nTourism managed by Discover Puerto Rico encouraged the marketing of the caves in Morovis.  \\nOnce the final 75 acres, which need to be purchased, are purchased by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA), then the park will be properly established as Parque Nacional Las Cabachuelas .   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°20\\xe2\\x80\\xb256\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°27\\xe2\\x80\\xb200\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.34889°N 66.45000°W ﻿ / 18.34889; -66.45000 \\n"

An initial admittance fee for Saturday and Sunday visits was established by the owner of a nearby gas station, due to the location\\'s popularity. The number of visitors is at its largest on both Saturdays and Sundays from early morning to an hour before nightfall. In January 2013, a daily admission fee was established, and later raised the following month. A boardwalk project was constructed from the gas station, leading up to around 200 feet into the trail, as well as a small parking lot atop a plateau behind the gas station. After a rise in popularity and visits, different admission fees were established for certain days of the week, providing necessary safety equipment for the 45-minute guided tour. The number of visitors is greatest on both Saturdays and Sundays from early morning to an hour before nightfall. Nightly tours are also offered on Wednesdays and Thursdays.   \nIn popular culture\nBetween February and March 2009, Disney Channel filmed Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie in Puerto Rico with scenes shot inside the cave as well as a land that sits in the Río Grande de Arecibo valley in front of the limestone cliff where the cave sits. In 2011, the cave was used as one of the settings for the 2012 British TV miniseries Treasure Island .

Together with Cayo Botella off the northwestern point, and Pelá and Pelaita to the west, Culebrita belongs to the barrio Fraile of the main island of Culebra. It is a nature reserve and is part of the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge . The island is home to Culebrita Lighthouse , one of the oldest lighthouses in the Caribbean . Culebrita is only accessible by private boat from the main island of Culebra.  \\n\nGeography\nCulebrita is a coral island approximately 1 mile in length and a tourist spot.  It is roughly y-shaped with three branches extending from the island\\'s center. Punta del Este is the easternmost landmass of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico .\\n\nThere are six beaches on Culebrita, the chief one being Playa Tortuga (Turtle Beach) on the north side of the island. The beach is named for the many sea turtles that use the beach for breeding grounds and the surrounding waters for grazing. Sea turtles Tina and Ike call Playa Tortuga home. The other two large beaches are Trash Beach and West Beach.  Because Trash Beach is located on the windward side of the island, debris is often blown onto this beach. This is how the beach gets its name. West Beach is where the water taxis from Culebra Island dock.  \\n\nThere are also large tidal pools on the east side of the island where people lounge as if they were large baths. The pools trap small sea life at low tide.  The west side of the island contains two lagoons . The Culebrita Reef lays off the southern coast of the island.\\n\nWetlands\nIsla Culebrita has two shallow lagoons , the largest of which, Laguna de Molino (Mill Lagoon), is located in northwest branch of the island. It covers approximately 5.5 acres (2.2 ha) and is about 3 feet (0.91 m) below sea level. The second lagoon, referred to as the eastern tidal flat , is located near the middle of the island\\'s west coast and covers about 0.9 acres (0.36 ha). Both lagoons are bordered on the seaward-side by a small mangrove fringe.  These wetlands are an important habitat for some of the local wildlife.\\n\nFlora and fauna\nIn 2006, an environmental and cultural resource survey of Culebrita  was carried out by Southeastern Archaeological Research (SEARCH) of Jonesville, Florida and Ellis Environmental Group, LC, in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Huntsville in order to identify \"cultural resources, sensitive habitats, and endangered plants and animals that may exist\" on Isla Culebrita. During the survey, a total of 97 plant species were recorded, none of which are state or federally threatened or endangered species. In addition, 32 birds, four reptiles, and two mammals were recorded. Of these animals, one federally endangered species, the brown pelican ( Pelecanus occidentalis ) and one threatened species, the white-cheeked pintail ( Anas bahamensis ) were observed. Endangered green sea turtles ( Chelonia mydas ) were also observed on the island.  \\n\nThe endangered Culebra skink live on Culebrita.  \\n\nGallery\nReferences"

Most dumped animals were not spayed or neutered .\\n\nThe beach was known for having one of the highest concentrations of stray animals in Puerto Rico. It attracted animal rights activists and groups hoping to make a difference. One example is The Sato Project, a large-scale rescue project which focuses its efforts on Sato Beach in Yabucoa.  Many individuals who come are so moved by these animals\\' living conditions that they extend their stay to help. Various rescue projects focus on the island\\'s development. Many of these efforts were prompted by abuse of animals, even by local authorities, as in the Barceloneta Massacre in 2007.  \\n\nBy 2014, a gate had been put up to deny access to people who would dump dogs on the beach and Sato Project regularly monitors the beach for strays.\\n\nGeography and climate\nPuerto Rico , mainly a 90-by-30 mile island located in the Caribbean region, includes smaller islands off of its eastern coast. Its average temperatures range from 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit . Its beaches stretch for hundreds of miles.  Along the northern coasts, are cliffs and a region known as the Karst region. This region contains notable land features such as caves, caverns, waterfalls, underground rivers and rain forests. Puerto Rico has the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic Ocean , known as the Puerto Rico Trench .  Notable rivers include the Guayanes River extends for 17 miles, as well as the Prieto , Arenas , Limones and Ingenio Rivers .  \\n\nYabucoa is surrounded on three sides by the San Lorenzo Batholith and the Caribbean Sea. It is humid and mainly flat. Mountain ranges in this area include Santa Elena peak, Pandura, and the Cayey Range.  Yabucoa valley consists mainly of farmland. It was originally a small mountain town.  \\n\nHistory\nThe name Yubucoa means \"place or site with waters\", although some scholars believe it means \"place of cassava\".  The area was founded in 1793 when Manuel Colón de Bonillas and his wife, Catalina Morales Pacheco, donated the settlement.  Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony until 1898, when it became a U.S. territory.  Economic hardship dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Although briefly resolved, such hardships play a key role in the story of Dead Dog Beach. Yabucoa received popularity when in 1989 the WBO held a boxing championship there between Orlando Fernandez and Julio Gervacio . Fernandez\\' victory brought attention to the town and to Puerto Rico.  \\n\nBefore becoming known as \"Dead Dog Beach,\" Playa Lucia was a popular beach. It consisted of a pool, cabana facilities and other recreational activities. It became a wasteland: the pool was covered in graffiti, and full of garbage. The facilities were abandoned and without proper maintenance turned into ruins. The only visitors who roamed the area were dogs and cats among piles of pet carcasses.  As of 2014, a gate was put up to deny access to people who would dump dogs on the beach and Sato Project has been regularly monitoring the beach for strays.   \\n\nCauses\nThe economy of Puerto Rico weakened under the weight of the 2017 hurricanes . Many individuals were forced to abandon their pets. Local shelters filled and individuals left the island.  \\n\nThe practice of not spaying and neutering pets causes population to expand rapidly. A majority [ citation needed ] of Puerto Rican pet owners believe that sterilization is not \"natural\" and/or \"kills their sex life\". Other owners breed their animals as a source of income. Some individuals go so far as to argue that it is less humane to kill their pet\\'s \"sex lives\" than to actually kill the pet.  \\n\nRescue projects\nThe Sato Project is an animal rescue project that operates across the territory while mainly focusing on Dead Dog Beach. Launched in 2011 by Chrissy Beckles and her husband Bobby Beckles, it is the official rescue group in Yabucoa. The Sato Project is composed of teams that work together to ship the dogs to the continental U.S. The Sato Project began a multi-phase campaign to facilitate and promote free spaying and neutering events in the area.\\n\nThe Animal Rescue Foundation is an animal rescue project started in 1997 which primarily operates in Rincon . Its main focus is to rescue dogs and cats, provide spaying/neutering and adoption services, and to educate the community about pet safety.  \\n\nBarks For Hope is a rescue foundation started by Leo Roubian in 2014. Its primary goal is to provide aid and adoption for abandoned animals throughout the island. The operation offers transportation and medical care, including rehabilitation and rides to be spayed and neutered.  \\n\nThe initiative, known as \"Spay-A-Thon\" for Puerto Rico, aims to provide high-quality, high-volume spay/neuter services to 20,000 animals in underserved communities across the Commonwealth by May 2019. With the support of Governor Ricardo Rosselló and First Lady Beatriz Rosselló, the Brevard Humane Society, located in Brevard County, Florida, was the only local animal welfare organization to participate in this historic endeavor.\\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Maria , the most destructive storm on record in Puerto Rico, Dr. Zenaida Agriat-Rodriguez, veterinarian for Brevard Humane Society, joined VIDAS (Veterinarios Internacionales Dedicados an Animales Sanos) for a spay/neuter clinic in the territory\\'s second largest city, Ponce.\\n\"We couldn't be happier to help a community that was ravaged by a devastating hurricane which left thousands of animals homeless. This collaboration will undoubtedly make a real difference and impact on the welfare of Puerto Rico's pets.\" said Theresa Clifton, executive director of the Brevard Humane Society.\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\nStephen McGarva moved to Puerto Rico in 2005, and, while exploring his new home, came face-to-face with the animals\\' plight. McGarva began feeding the dogs and cleaning their wounds daily, in the hope to make them more adoptable. McGarva remained in the territory for several years to take care of the animals before returning the U.S. where by sharing his experiences, raised awareness of the animal crisis in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n18°02\\xe2\\x80\\xb2N 65°50\\xe2\\x80\\xb2W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.04°N 65.83°W ﻿ / 18.04; -65.83 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nDesecheo National Wildlife Refuge\nThe Desecheo National Wildlife Refuge  is a National Wildlife Refuge in Puerto Rico .  It is part of the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex .\\n\nThe island of Desecheo is located 14 miles (23 km) west of Puerto Rico and is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the north and the Caribbean Sea on the south. The refuge encompasses the entire rugged island. From 1940 to 1952 the island was used as a practice target for aerial bombardment by the US War Department and from 1952 to 1960 Desecheo was used as a survival training area for the U.S. Air Force . Although formerly containing a colony of 15,000 brown boobies and 10,000 red-footed boobies , currently no successful booby breeding is known to occur on the island.\\n\nOther seabird species also use the island. There are three endemic species of lizards . The endangered higo chumbo cactus is found on the island and hawksbill turtles sometimes nest on the refuge. Feral goats became established on the island in the 18th century. No public use is allowed on the island because of safety considerations associated with unexploded ordnance that remain on the refuge. The refuge has had a colorful past. In 1966, the National Institutes of Health introduced 56 rhesus monkeys to be later culled for medical research. Desecheo is often used as a drop-off point for illegal aliens and drugs.\\n\nConservation and Restoration\nBefore the introduction of invasive rats, the island hosted large colonies of breeding seabirds, including the largest Brown Booby colony in the Caribbean region and an important Red-footed Booby colony. But, due to the destruction of native vegetation and predation on eggs and chicks by invasive rats and Rhesus macaques , seabirds nesting was reduced significantly on Desecheo and many plants and animals were threatened.\\n\nIn response to this threat, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Island Conservation , and other key partners, including the US Department of Agriculture, Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PR-DNER), Bell Laboratories, and Tomcat, eradicated the invasive vertebrates providing significant benefits for seabirds, the island's endemic lizards, three endemic arachnids, the federally Threatened Higo Chumbo cactus and native plants.     \\n\nIn July 2017, one year after the final phase of this ambitious operation, conservation biologists confirmed that these predators are absent from the island, and the operation was declared a success.  This project, the largest conservation operation of its kind to date in the region, aims to return the island to its former status as the most important seabird colony in the region.\\n\nIn February 2018, USFWS , Island Conservation and Effective Environmental Restoration Inc (EER) with support from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the National Geographic Society initiated a seabird social attraction project to encourage Bridled Terns , Brown Noddies , and Audubon's Shearwaters to nest on the island.  The teams established seabird colonies using decoy, mirrors, and sound systems playing recorded bird calls to make it appear as if the birds were already on the island in an attempt to revive the once-thriving seabird colony.\\n\nReferences\nThis article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service .\\n\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nDestilería Serrallés\n\\n\nDestilería Serrallés is a rum producer located in Ponce, Puerto Rico , and best known for its Don Q rum brand.  The company is Puerto Rico\\'s oldest family-owned company and has revenues of over 100 million dollars.  In 2011, it was responsible for pumping over $300 million annually into the Puerto Rican economy from the sale of its rums in the United States mainland alone.  \\n\nHistory\nThe history of Destilería Serrallés is the history of the Serrallés family. The Serrallés family was a Spanish family from Catalonia that established its links to Puerto Rico in the mid-1830s. They were successful in harvesting and refining cane sugar and exporting it to the United States , the United Kingdom and France . The sugar cane plantation they built virtually became a company town , and eventually had its own rail line, workers\\' housing, transportation fleet, commissary, and private\\xe2\\x80\\x94later public\\xe2\\x80\\x94airport (Ponce\\'s Mercedita Airport ). Most of these operations were eventually annexed to the municipality of Ponce , in whose lands the plantation is based. Sugar cane molasses imported from the Dominican Republic is still transformed into rum until now at the same Serralles distilling facility that has been used for over a century.  \\n\nMercedita\nIn 1865, the family opened a rum manufacturing facility at their plantation, the \" Hacienda Mercedita \" , named honoring the Serrallés family matriarch, Mercedes Perez. In that year, Juan Serralles Colon , who would go down as one of the most successful liquor salesmen in Puerto Rican history, imported a still from France , which enabled him to produce his first casks of rum. [ citation needed ] \\n\nDon Q\nThe Serrallés operation produced various local rum brands, most of which were short-lived. Inspired by the success of other rum producers on the island, the family launched a refined brand intending to export it elsewhere. The Ron Don Q brand was launched in 1932, and became popular with locals who considered rival Bacardi either harsher in taste or a foreign brand (Bacardí opened its distilling operations in Puerto Rico in the early 1930s, and at the time it was considered a Cuban brand, since its headquarters were in Santiago de Cuba ). By the 1960s, Ron Don Q was available in most of Puerto Rico\\'s important supermarket chains, such as Pueblo and others. It also became available at Amigo . In addition to rum, the distillery also produces medicinal alcohol, plus wine, vodka, and Don Juan .  \\n\nAcquisition of Puerto Rico Distillers\nIn 1985, Serrallés, Inc., under the leadership of Felix Juan Serrallés, Sr., purchased Puerto Rico Distillers, Inc., from the Canadian liquor giant Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, LTD. The Company grew rapidly when it bought Puerto Rico Distillers in 1985. This acquisition increased the company\\'s product line to include Palo Viejo, Ron Llave and Granado, and doubled the firm\\'s sales.  The acquisitions included manufacturing facilities in Camuy and Arecibo plus the brand names sold by Seagrams locally such as: \"Palo Viejo\", \"Ron Llave\" and \"Granado\".  Serrallés also purchased the rights to produce and distribute the brands of \"Ronrico\" and \"Captain Morgan\" in Puerto Rico and the rest of the Caribbean .  These same brands, now produced by Serrallés, are distributed in the United States by Seagrams.  Captain Morgan rum is the third largest selling rum in the world after Tanduay and Bacardi .  As a result, Serrallés, Inc., more than doubled its sales.  \\n\nDistribution\nThe company\\'s flagship product, Ron Don Q, is currently sold in the United States , Mexico , the Virgin Islands , Spain , and a number of other countries. Serrallés USA, the USA distribution company of Destilería Serrallés, is based in Stamford, Connecticut .  \\n\nCompetition\nRon Don Q is the best-selling rum in Puerto Rico, ahead of Bacardi and Captain Morgan .  The Captain Morgan Rum brand is owned by Diageo PLC but made by Destilería Serrallés in a different Puerto Rican distillery under a supply contract.  In 2008, Diageo\\'s Captain Morgan contract with Serrallés was not renewed, as Diageo\\'s moved its production of Captain Morgan to the U.S. Virgin Islands.  \\n\nAwards\nThe company has been the recipient of several awards, among them are the Green Award by the magazine The Drinks Business for their implementation of renewable energy in their company facilities.  Serrallés was also honored with the World Class Distillery 2019 prize by World Spirit Awards.  \\n\nAdvertising\nRon Don Q has also been engaged in numerous advertising campaigns. Television ads have run on Puerto Rican channels for decades, and the brand has sponsored local sports teams, such as baseball \\'s Leones de Ponce and their BSN basketball counterpart, the basketball Leones . The Serrallés distillery also sponsors the \"Copa Serralles\" boat race , where Ron Don Q is prominently advertised. Don Q also has appeared on a number of films. Don Q rum is available in small bottle samples at supermarkets, pharmacies and liquor stores. Proof66.com, an aggregator of liquor ratings from various experts, places the Don Q Añejo in the Top 10th percentile of all rums.  \\n\nCurrently\nThe company\\'s current president and CEO is Philippe Brechot.  The company currently produces over 60% of the rum sold in Puerto Rico.  In 1998, the annual sales of Serrallés. Inc. surpassed $100 million. [ citation needed ] The company has become a large industrial and marketing enterprise that produces and distributes over 80 different product lines worldwide.  \\n\nSince 2000, the Grupo Serralles which includes the distillery companies also owns the Ponce Hilton & Casino .  It is one of America\\'s 100 oldest family-owned businesses.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°0\\xe2\\x80\\xb255.008\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°33\\xe2\\x80\\xb253.1714\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.01528000°N 66.564769833°W ﻿ / 18.01528000; -66.564769833 \\n"

Rivero Zoo of Puerto Rico , also known as the Mayagüez Zoo , was a 45-acre (18 ha) zoological park located in Mayagüez , Puerto Rico , owned by the Government of Puerto Rico and operated by the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources , under the agency of the Company of National Parks of Puerto Rico. It was named in honor of Juan A. Rivero , its first director. It was Puerto Rico\\'s only zoo and had an extensive collection of animals from all continents.\\n\nThe zoo closed to the public after the impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017 and fully ceased operations in 2023 after much scrutiny in its final years due to questionable health and treatment of their animals. All species were later relocated to sanctuaries across the United States after the closure.\\n\nHistory\nThe zoo opened in 1954, when legislator Benjamin Cole authored the law that created the zoo,  which was named after its founder and first director Dr. Juan A. Rivero .  The zoo went through a major upgrade in 2003 with the addition of an aviary, arthropodary and a butterfly exhibition.  Committed to animal welfare, especially those facing extinction, the zoo had several conservation programs for the Puerto Rican crested toad , the plain pigeon and the Andean condor .\\n\nIn March 2008 the zoo acquired two new giraffes and two desert warthogs to augment the African collection. The animals were brought from Ohio and Louisiana .  The economic crisis related to the government debt crisis in Puerto Rico that began in 2014, led to issues with zoo maintenance and animal care.  \\n\nDespite the zoo being closed to the public after Hurricane Maria in September 2017, the zoo still had employed zookeepers to care for the animals, including two lion cubs that were born at the zoo in 2019.  That same year, volunteer efforts began to help maintain the zoo in preparation for a planned 2021 reopening of the facilities.   The following year, in 2020, FEMA had assigned $6.2 million to the zoo for repairs related to the hurricane.  \\n\nOne of the zoo\\'s most popular and well-known animals was Mundi, a female African savanna elephant , born in the wild in 1982 at Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe . She was rescued among 63 other young African elephant calves through a rescue mission funded by Arthur Jones , after they were left orphaned by the Zimbabwe government, who organized a mass culling . Jones brought the calves to the United States in 1984, including Mundi, and sold them off to circuses and zoos. Mundi was sold off to the Mayagüez Zoo in 1988 after a brutal attack left her blind in one eye and a permanently damaged tusk. She remained in solitary display for 35 years at the time when the zoo was permanently closed in February 2023.\\n\nIn 2017, plans to relocate Mundi began through Carol Buckley \\'s Elephant Aid International non-profit organization. In 2018, the organization signed a contract with the Government of Puerto Rico to relocate the elephant to Buckley\\'s Elephant Refuge North America sanctuary in Attapulgus, Georgia but the plans were thwarted when the 2019 political scandal erupted and the contract was cancelled. After the zoo ceased operations in February 2023, Mundi was transported and escorted to Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla on May 11, 2023 and flown to Jacksonville, Florida the next day. She was then transported by ground to Buckley\\'s sanctuary, to live the rest of her lifetime with two rescued Asian elephants Tarra, a female, and Bo, a male.  \\n\nDecline and closure\nWithin the zoo\\'s final ten years alone, the zoo was cited for several violations of inhumane killings, including a puma, coatimundi, and a baboon that were \"not fit for exhibition\". Two guinea pigs on exhibition were fed alive to reptiles, and deer on exhibition were fed to big cats after having their jugulars cut without using a humane slaughter method. There were also accounts of the zoo using expired medications and having inadequate vet care. The United States Department of Agriculture investigated the zoo, and did not renew their federal permits.  \\n\nOn May 23, 2022, it was announced that the zoo\\'s male chimpanzee , Magnum, had died at the age of 39.  Although the official cause of death given was his advanced age, animal rights activists demanded for his death to be investigated, as they claim he had cardiac ailments for which he received no treatment.  \\n\nOn February 27, 2023, the permanent closure of the zoo was announced,  by order of the United States Department of Justice , following much scrutiny due to questionable health and malnourishment of their animals, as well as the treatment they were receiving. The efforts to relocate all species to sanctuaries were completed between February and June 2023, with assistance from the Puerto Rico Natural Resources Ranger Corps , the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and The Wild Animal Sanctuary in Keenesburg, Colorado .  \\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

Before the founding of Aguadilla, the site around the water source was used by Sir Francis Drake as a resupplying base in 1595. The spring kept being used as a primary water source for Spanish soldiers and later on by the first European settlers of the region between the 16th and 18th centuries, who named the new town San Carlos de La Aguadilla partially after the Ojo de Agua (Aguadilla is also the diminutive of Aguada , the name of the older town located directly to the south). The site was also visited and mentioned by the Benedictine monk and historian Fray Inigo Abad y La Sierra , who described it as a site of great beauty.  \\n\nThe first foundations of El Parterre were established by German engineer Enrique Hau (Heinrich Hau) who built a mortar and stone enclosure around the spring and a shallow brick pool and stone channel along the stream in 1852. The Puente de la Reina (\\'the Queen\\'s Bridge\\') was added to the plaza by orders of Spanish magistrate Adolfo Ruiz in 1865, and the rest of the park was completed in 1882, by then mayor Don Ramón Méndez de Arcay.  \\n\nThe park and spring were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1986,   and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n\nThis article about a property in Puerto Rico on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub .

El Toro, named after the highest peak in the forest at 3,524 feet (1,074 m), is the only tropical wilderness in the United States National Forest System.  It was created in 2005 by the Caribbean National Forest Act of 2005.  \\n\nIn descending order of land area, the wilderness is located in parts of the municipalities of Río Grande , Naguabo , Las Piedras , and Canóvanas . El Toro Wilderness, along with the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), is part of the Luquillo Biosphere Reserve , a designated UNESCO biosphere reserve , which emphasizes the site's importance in the global protection of biodiversity through conservation action.  \\n\nFeatures\nEl Toro Wilderness has dense vegetation with mixed evergreen plants ranging from 3 meters to 30 meters in height at the highest and lowest mountain elevations, respectively. The forest protects all four major forest types found throughout the national forest: the tabonuco forest, the palo colorado forest, the Sierra palm tree forest and the dwarf forest (also known as the elfin forest or cloud forest ).  \\n\nThe wilderness is home to a number of plant and animal species found nowhere else in the world, such as the endangered Puerto Rican parrot and the rare elfin woods warbler . The forest is home to 42 native and 35 migratory bird species, a number of bat species, and high numbers of amphibian and reptile species, such as the Puerto Rican boa . Some of the rare plant species found in the area include the endangered miniature orchid Lepanthes eltoroensis and the critically endangered palo de jazmín ( Styrax portoricensis ).  \\n\nThe area also contains important archaeological sites and Taino petroglyphs , such as the Icacos Petroglyph Group (also known as the Rio Blanco Petroglyphs), listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2015.  \\n\nRecreation\nRecreational opportunities in the wilderness include hiking , birdwatching and primitive or dispersed camping . Two hiking trails cross the wilderness area: El Toro Trail , which starts from Cubuy in Canóvanas and leads to the summit of El Toro , and the Sabana Trail which begins at the Sabana Recreation Area in Naguabo and loops through the dense jungle. Additionally, the Tradewinds Trail traverses El Toro Wilderness and connects these two trails with the rest of the national forest.  \\n\nThe entrance to the El Toro Trail is at Road 186 km 10.8 which is near an entrance to the park in Road 186. This is a steep about 3-hour hike. First you will go by next to some private property, then see the trail signs, then a steep gravel trail for 1 hr, then a very muddy trail, then a series of boulders like a staircase for 1 hr and then a flat path to the top. From El Toro peak it connects to the Tradewinds Trail which starts in El Yunque PR 191 - the main access road to El Yunque. \\n\nFrom El Toro peak it connects to the Tradewinds Trail which starts in El Yunque PR 191 - the main access road to El Yunque. Advise to return from here since the other trail is over 4 hours long and you will end way off your parked car, unless you have someone pick up up in the end gate of PR 191.\\n\nEl Toro peak is the tallest and has a view of the east coast of Puerto Rico - the Naguabo and Humacao towns and the ocean. This peak has less rain and fog compared to El Yunque and is undeveloped. Very few do come around here unlike El Yunque trail.\\n\nLike most deep forest trails there is little if any cell phone reception and one must be very careful since you are very isolated. Try to come early to avoid being there at night, carry water, some food and good shoes. Avoid this forest when hurricanes are close or during storms. After major storms or hurricanes, the trails may be damaged, and the park closed.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nEl Tuque\n\\n\nEl Tuque is a beach and family recreational and tourist complex in the Punta Cucharas sector of Barrio Canas in Ponce, Puerto Rico .  It was designed in the early 1960s by Luis Flores , an architect from Cayey, Puerto Rico .  It is located on PR-2 , Km 220.1, in the El Tuque sector of Barrio Canas in Ponce.  The sector of El Tuque is considered Puerto Rico\\'s largest populated sector.  The beach opened on 17 July 1965.  \\n\nHistory\nThe name El Tuque comes from the name of a farm of measuring 267.11 cuerdas that was located in that area of Barrio Canas in the early 20th century.  \\n\nThe once deserted beach was developed into a balneario (balneary or bathhouse) by the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the mid-1960s, as part of the central government\\'s attempt to provide a network of such recreational facilities throughout the island.  It included gazebos and fire pits near the beach, a restaurant, changing rooms with showers and lockers, a children\\'s pool, and two adult Olympic-size swimming pools with snack bars. It was inaugurated on 17 July 1965.  \\n\nDue to beach erosion that occurred over the years, a beach replenishment project then took place in 1979,  but the sand added was darker than the original sand there and locals now consider the beach \"dirty\".  \\n\nBy the early-1980s, however, the area had fallen into disrepair, starting with the swimming pools and parking areas, for lack of proper maintenance by the Commonwealth Government. As a result, the beach opened only sporadically.  Eventually the complex was permanently shut down in the late 1980s. The Municipality of Ponce, then obtained ownership of the property from the Commonwealth government via a transfer.  About a decade later, in 1996, the United States Army Corps of Engineers picked up the El Tuque project again for purposes of re-furbishing the beach with new sand.    \\n\nEl Tuque Recreational Complex\nIn May 2002, a group of private investors became interested in the area and entered into a contract with the Puerto Rico central government to develop the area into a family and tourist recreational center. The investors spent $16 million to develop the area into the El Tuque Beach Entertainment Center.  El Tuque Recreational Complex opened in the summer of 2002 and included an aquatic complex / splash water park with three pools with waves, high speed water slides, and water sports. Some of activities of the park were hiking, swimming, boating, fishing, whitewater paddling, snorkeling, and scuba diving.  The aquatic park closed in 2007, the same year that an accident at the water park injured a park patron leaving him quadriplegic.  The complex had a pub and a Quality Inn hotel located on the beach, within the recreational complex facilities.  A nearby Holiday Inn hotel that had opened a few years earlier, provides additional lodging facilities for beach-goers.\\n\nA second addition to the project, which opened in 2003, includes a new speedway called the Ponce International Speedway Park .  It includes a drag-racing track and circuit track. The speedway drag-racing sections has both 1/4-mile and 1/8th-mile sections, and the full circuit is 1.52 miles long and incorporates 12 turns.  A small marina has also been added. Boating and kayaking is promoted as part of the center\\'s eco-tourism activities.  \\n\nSolace by the Sea\nIn 2017, following Hurricane María , Grupo Misla Villalba, a group of local investors, remodeled the former Quality Inn Hotel, which had closed 2 years before, and opened a new hotel, named \"Solace by the Sea\" on 30 November 2017.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nEl Yunque National Forest\nEl Yunque National Forest , formerly known as the Caribbean National Forest (or Bosque Nacional del Caribe ),   is a forest located in northeastern Puerto Rico . While there are both temperate and tropical rainforests in other states and territories, it is the only tropical rainforest in the United States National Forest System and the United States Forest Service .  El Yunque National Forest is located on the slopes of the Sierra de Luquillo mountains, encompassing more than 28,000 acres (43.753 mi 2 or 113.32 km 2 ) of land, making it the largest block of public land in Puerto Rico .\\n\nThe forest contains and is named after named Pico El Yunque , the second highest mountain in the Sierra de Luquillo . Other peaks within the national forest are Pico del Este , Pico del Oeste, El Cacique and the highest peak, El Toro , which is the highest point in the national forest and in eastern Puerto Rico rising 3,494 feet (1,065 m) above sea level.\\n\nAmple rainfall (over 20 feet a year in some areas, or an average of 120 inches of water up to 240 inches of water a year) creates a jungle-like setting\\xe2\\x80\\x94lush foliage, crags, waterfalls, and rivers are a frequent sight. The forest has a number of trails from which the jungle-like territory\\'s flora and fauna can be appreciated. El Yunque forest is also renowned for its unique Taíno petroglyphs . It is said that indigenous people believed that El Yunque was the throne of their chief god Yúcahu , so that it is the Caribbean equivalent to Mount Olympus in Greek mythology .\\n\nNaming and etymology\nEl Yunque is the name of the mountain peak, Pico El Yunque , the name of the forest and, colloquially on some occasions, the name for the entire Sierra de Luquillo range. El Yunque most likely comes from or relates to the Spanish word yunque , meaning anvil . This name references the relatively high and flat shape of the Sierra de Luquillo range when observed from the north (El Yunque Peak) or the south ( El Toro ). It is also said that the Spanish name might have been influenced by the native names for the mountain: Yukén or Yuke possibly meaning \"white land\", and Luquillo or Yukiyu , another name for the spirit or deity Yokahu and also the name of a legendary cacique, Loquillo .   It is not known whether the mountain gives its name to the range or vice versa.\\n\nHistory\n\\nThe area of the El Yunque National Forest has been notable since the pre-Columbian era. The forest today is home to several archaeological sites related to the indigenous Taínos , such as the Río Blanco petroglyphs , although no evidence of permanent settlement has been found in the area, which suggests that it was possibly avoided and most likely considered sacred .  \nThe Spanish began the conquest the island of Borinquen in 1493, and gold was soon found in the Fajardo and Blanco Rivers in 1509, which sparked interest in gold mining in the area. By 1513 there were gold mines in both river areas and gold was soon found in other rivers of the mountain range such as the Sabana , Prieto , La Mina , Mameyes , Espíritu Santo and Canóvanas rivers. The period of gold mining in the area however ended in 1530 when miners and settlers started being attacked by rebelling Taínos, and the area would not be settled again until the 17th century. The area where El Portal Rainforest Visitor Center is located used to be the site of a coffee plantation named Hacienda Catalina . Coffee was introduced and cultivated in the slopes of El Yunque in the 1730s but the area remained relatively untouched until the 19th century when the lowland forests were exploited for timber and cut down for the development of agriculture, which attracted the attention of the Spanish Crown . The forest during this time was part of the Crown Lands of Puerto Rico and in 1853 the Spanish government sent foresters from the Inspección de Montes (the Spanish Forest Service) to survey the land. Due to the rapid population growth in the island and the poor farming practices of the impoverished European immigrants of the time, the forest region was formally set aside in 1876 by King Alfonso XII of Spain with the purpose of preserving the soil and water resources and regulating the timber industry in the region. This makes El Yunque one of the oldest reserves in the Western Hemisphere , only four years younger than Yellowstone National Park .  \\nThe Spanish Crown ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898 . At the time, most of the original forests in Puerto Rico had been either cut or burned down, and the highlands of the Sierra de Luquillo contained the last remaining tracts of untouched forest in the island. President Theodore Roosevelt set aside the previous Crown Lands of El Yunque area, and the Luquillo Forest Reserve was established on 17 January 1903 by the United States General Land Office with 65,950 acres (266.9 km 2 ). It became a National Forest in 1906 and renamed the Caribbean National Forest on 4 June 1935.  The forest was still used for timber during the First and Second World Wars , and several military installations such as radars and communications infrastructure were installed in the forest, particularly on the highest peaks, such as the early-warning radar site installed in Pico El Yunque to observe and protect against possible incursions by German aircraft and submarines.   \nThe Caribbean National Forest was designated an Insular Wildlife Refuge by the US Department of Agriculture in 1946, and reforestation efforts were also established between 1934 and 1948 to revitalize the parts of the forest that had been formerly lost due to human activity. The Luquillo Experimental Forest was established in 1956 to promote scientific research and expand conservation efforts for the critically endangered Puerto Rican parrot and the recently discovered yet endangered elfin woods warbler . Most of the recreational infrastructure was developed in the 1980s and the field offices were moved to their current location in 1981.  The National Science Foundation established El Verde Field Station in 1988 under an agreement with the US Forest Service as a primary site for the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research (Luquillo-LTER, now managed by the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras ) with the goal of supporting scientific research of tropical ecosystems due to the occurrence of five out of six of Holdridge\\'s life zones and forest types.  \\nThe forest was heavily damaged by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Georges in 1998, and it is estimated that only 23 individual parrots remained in the wild afterwards. Between 2000 and 2002, 35 captive parrots were released into the wild as part of a program to save the critically endangered bird. An executive order signed by President George W. Bush on 2 April 2007 changed the name of the Caribbean National Forest to El Yunque National Forest , better reflecting the cultural and historical feelings of the Puerto Rican people .  Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused deforestation, landslides and heavy damage to the forest and its infrastructure in 2017, drastically reducing the Puerto Rican parrot population once again.  As of 2020 the population has begun to recover and the captive population\\'s reproduction rates has also doubled under the supervision of the Fish and Wildlife Service . The Portal Rainforest Visitor Center reopened at the end of 2021, after being reconstructed following Hurricane Maria. El Yunque National Forest today extends over 28,000 acres through the municipalities of Río Grande , Luquillo , Naguabo , Ceiba , Fajardo , Canóvanas , Las Piedras and Juncos .\\n\nClimate\nBecause Puerto Rico is located between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn , it has a tropical climate , more specifically a tropical rainforest climate , with higher elevations over 3,000 feet bordering on a subtropical highland climate . There is no distinct wet or dry season in El Yunque; it rains year-round. The temperature and length of daylight remain fairly constant throughout the year. The average temperature in the summer is 80 °F (26 °C) high and 68 °F (20 °C) low and in the winter 72 °F (22 °C) high and 58 °F (15 °C) low, Temperatures can drop below 50 °F (10 °C) on clear nights during the winter, but never below freezing. All of these factors provide a year-round growing season.\\n\nEcology and conservation\nIts ecosystem is specifically surveyed by the Management Team of Ecosystems (Equipo de Manejos de Ecosistemas), which is led by Pedro Rios.  Due to its location in the northeastern part of Puerto Rico, the incoming trade winds from the Atlantic Ocean bash into the mountains, leading to an excess of rainfall registered at about 240 inches (6.1 m) per year.  This process is called orographic lift and accounts for the intense rainfall and constant cloud presence in this mountainous region. This constant cloud cover and persistent winds produced by the adiabatic process of air particles rushing up through the mountainside has affected the morphology of El Yunque, but the most effect has been on the bosque enano or dwarf forest .  \\n\nThe forest is home to over 200 species of trees and plants, 16 of which are endemic to the forest.  The critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon ( Amazona vittata ), with an estimated wild population of 58-80 individuals in the wild, occurred exclusively in this forest until 19 November 2006, when another wild population was released by the Department of Natural Resources in the municipality of Utuado \\'s Río Abajo State Forest .  \\n\nEl Yunque National Forest contains one designated wilderness area, El Toro Wilderness , which is the only tropical rainforest in the United States National Wilderness Preservation System .  \\n\nThe Baño de Oro Natural Area is an 1,840-acre Research Natural Area and National Natural Landmark located within El Yunque National Forest. The Research Natural Area was established by the United States Department of Agriculture \\'s Forest Service in 1949 with the goal of preserving a forest area situated between 800 ft. and 3,365 ft. in elevation encompassing two life zones, a rare Pterocarpus swamp, and four major forest types that are free of human disturbance for the purpose of scientific study, education and future conservation efforts. Baño de Oro is listed as a National Natural Landmark since 1980.   \\n\nFlora\n\\nEl Yunque is composed of four different forest vegetation areas: Tabonuco Forest, Palo Colorado Forest, Sierra Palm Forest, and the Dwarf Forest . El Yunque forest supports a vast array of animal and plant life that varies depending on the altitude range in the rainforest.\nThis forest area is located at 1,970 feet (600 m) above sea level and is dominated by the Sierra palm tree ( Prestoea montana ). This palm tree can be found throughout the national forest but the shallowness of the soil makes it the dominant tree at this height of the forest.\\n\nThis forest area is found above 2,500 feet (600-900 m) above sea level and is dominated by the palo colorado ( Cyrilla racemiflora ). The most distinctive features of this tree are its red crooked bark which gives it its Spanish name. These trees are not endemic to the island but they are native to the region. This forest area is a partial old growth forest and some of the palo colorado trees are estimated to be up to 1,000 years old. Due to the shallowness of its bark, the trunks of these trees are commonly used as nesting sites by endangered Puerto Rican parrots ( Amazona vittata ).\\n\nOther trees found in the palo colorado forest area caimitillo ( Micropholis garcinifolia ), green caimitillo ( Micropholis garciniaefolia ), yarumo ( Cecropia peltata ), Caribbean azafran ( Hedyosmum arborencens ) and the Sierra palm tree ( Prestoea montana ).\\n\nThe tabonuco tree ( Dacryodes excelsa ) from which this forest area got its name occurs from 660 to 2800 feet (200 to 900 meters) in the mountains of Puerto Rico as well as other islands that make up the Antilles . The laurel magnolia ( Magnolia splendens ), an endangered magnolia tree that is endemic to eastern Puerto Rico, can be found in this forest area as well. This forest is very diverse in trees, having over 170 species such as bulletwood ( Manilkara bidentata ), West Indian giant fern ( Cyathea arborea ), yarumo ( Cecropia peltata ), macho yarumo ( Didymopanax morototoni ), granadillo ( Buchenavia capitata ) and guaraguao tree ( Guarea guidona ).  \\n\nThe dwarf forest ecosystem is located at around 3,000 feet (910 m) and composes the smallest sub-region in El Yunque forest. The forest is characterized by the variation of vegetation that is only found in Puerto Rico. The vegetation shows stunted growth in which the diameter of the trunk is widened and the number of leaves on the branches is lower than expected.  Other specific factors that affect the growth of this sub-region are the high level of acidity and poor water runoff from the soil.\\n\nAlthough many species have adapted to these harsh environments, five species are frequent in the dwarf forest: Ocotea spathulata , Tabebuia rigida , Calyptranthes krugii , Eugenia borinquensis and Calycogonium squamulosum . The other abundant type of plants in the dwarf forest are epiphytes . The great amount of competition in the canopy does not allow lower-level plants to develop and prosper.  The characteristic of having a widened tree trunk is ideal for epiphytes that require a host to live. Therefore, a substantial number of epiphytic plants have cemented their existence in the flora of El Yunque forest, specifically in the dwarf forest due to the moisture, precipitation and protection from the sun.\\n\nFauna\nThe national forest is home to numerous species of animals, many of which are endemic to Puerto Rico. In addition to the critically endangered Puerto Rican parrot, other endangered species found in the forest are the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk ( Buteo platypterus brunnescens ), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk ( Accipiter striatus venator ), the Elfin woods warbler ( Setophaga angelae ) and the Puerto Rican boa ( Epicratus inornatus ). The white-necked crow ( Corvus leucognaphalus ), which used to be found in the region, has been completely extirpated from the island and is now only found in Hispaniola .\\n\nOther animals found within the forest boundaries are the Puerto Rican oriole ( Icterus portoricensis ), the peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus ), red fruit bat ( Stenoderma rufus ), the Puerto Rican giant anole ( Anolis cuvieri ) and the Puerto Rican twig anole ( Anolis occultus ). The endangered American eel ( Anguilla rostrata ), the fat sleeper fish ( Dormitator maculatus ), the bigmouth sleeper fish ( Gobiomorus dormitor ), big claw river shrimp ( Macrobrachium carcinus ) and the bocú shrimp ( Macrobrachium crenulatum ) are found in the rivers and creeks that originate and flow from El Yunque.  \\n\nThe Puerto Rican parrot or Puerto Rican Amazon is a little parrot that measures 11.0-11.8 in (28-30 cm). The bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. The species is the only remaining native parrot in Puerto Rico. The total estimated population as of 2012 was 58-80 individuals in the wild and over 300 individuals in captivity.  \\n\nApproximately 16 species of common coqui, members of the diverse neotropical frog genus Eleutherodactylus , are known in Puerto Rico. Of these 16, 13 have been found in El Yunque National Forest.  This small frog earned its Puerto Rican common name due to the call of the most common coquí species in Puerto Rico, Eleutherodactylus coqui , which begins as the sun sets and ends in early dawn. This has made it an animal of great endearment to Puerto Ricans and in contemporary times the coqui has become a symbol of Puerto Ricans .\\n\nAlthough the coquí is an amphibian, it possesses some features that are unusual in frogs. These differences are seen mainly in its morphology, reproduction, and developmental stages. In terms of morphology, the coquí does not have webbing between its toes because it is a tree dweller in moist environments. Another significant difference is that it does not have a definite larval stage and the eggs laid by the female are terrestrial instead of aquatic.  This means that a miniature frog-let, rather than a tadpole, arises from the incubation period.\\n\nOther species of coqui found in the forest are the grass coqui ( Eleutherodactylus brittoni ), Eneida\\'s coqui ( Eleutherodactylus eneidae ), the cricket coqui ( Eleutherodactylus gryllus ), Hedrick\\'s coqui ( Eleutherodactylus hedricki ), the web-footed coqui ( Eleutherodactylus karlschmidti ), the locust coqui ( Eleutherodactylus locustus ), the upland or forest coqui ( Eleutherodactylus portoricensis ), the bronze or Richmond\\'s coqui ( Eleutherodactylus richmondi ), the dwarf coqui ( Eleutherodactylus unicolor ) and the melodious or wrinkled coqui ( Eleutherodactylus wightmanae ).\\n\nPer a study published October 2018, by Bradford C. Lister and Andres Garcia, arthropod biomass in the Luquillo rainforest data taken during the 1970s compared to 30 years later has fallen 10 to 60 times. The study revealed synchronous declines in the lizards, frogs, and birds that eat arthropods. The study indicated that climate warming is the driving force behind the collapse of the forest\\'s food web. Over the past 30 years, forest temperatures have risen 2.0 °C.          \\n\nRecreation\nIn addition to being an important ecological forest reserve, El Yunque National Forest is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Puerto Rico,  both for locals and visitors, and it offers numerous recreational opportunities such as picnicking, birdwatching, and biking in designated areas. Camping is allowed in designated areas (depending on the size of the group) and there are also cabins available for rent. Additionally, the forest is known for its vista points and observation towers: Yokahu Tower and Mount Britton Tower.  \\n\nHiking is probably the most popular activity in El Yunque National Forest.  The forest offers several trails with varying difficulties.  The 35.9 mile (57.8 km) long Puerto Rican Northeast Trail also connects to and traverses through El Yunque.  \\n\nPico El Yunque Trail (or just El Yunque Trail) is the main hiking trail (or at least the most popular) [ citation needed ] of the forest and it extends for about 5.4 miles that lead to the summit of El Yunque , the second highest point of the Sierra de Luquillo. Although considered moderate in difficulty, some of its side trails are considered to be more challenging; the trail itself has an elevation gain of 1,748 feet. The trailhead is located close to the end of PR-191 and La Mina Falls, next to the Palo Colorado Information Center, in an area of the national forest often referred to as the La Mina Recreational Area. The trail crosses all four biomes of the national forest. It is open year-round and dogs are also allowed on this trail but must be kept on a leash at all times.   \\n\nMt. Britton Tower Trail is a small 1.6-mile trail that starts off at El Yunque Trail and crosses a Sierra palm forest on the way to the top of Mount Britton, the 8th tallest peak in the forest. The summit is part of the cloud forest and it hosts a small lookout tower built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937 that on clear days offers views of both the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea .  The trail has an elevation gain of approximately 650 feet and although it is rated as moderate to difficult.  \\n\nThe very short but steep trail starts off Pico El Yunque Trail and it extends for little more than 0.2 miles to the top, where a stone masonry platform offers a 360 panoramic view of the surrounding mountains and the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. The vegetation along this trail belongs to that of the rare dwarf forest ecosystem which features \"dwarf trees\" such as the miniature tree Clusia clusioides , and equally small species of animals such as the dwarf anole ( Anolis occultus ) and the endangered elfin woods warbler ( Setophaga angelae ). This ecological zone is also known as the elfin woodlands.  Although very short, the trail difficulty is classified as moderate to difficult.  \\n\nThis is a short and easy 0.4-mile trail that begins close to the Sierra Palm Visitor Center on PR-191. The trail crosses a rainy forest primarily inhabited by tree ferns ( Cyathea arborea and Alsophila dryopteroides ) and Sierra palm trees. The trail leads to the Caimitillo picnic area. Dogs are also allowed on this trail but must be kept on a leash at all times.  \\n\nThe Angelito Trail is an easy short 0.7-mile-long trail that crosses the tabonuco forest zone leads to the Las Damas Pool, also known as Charco Angelito, a series of natural pools along the Mameyes River .  Although the trail is easy visitors must be cautious of the weather since the area is prone to flash flooding . The trail and area were heavily damaged during Hurricane Maria in 2017 but it has recently reopened. Dogs are allowed on the trail but must be kept on a leash. The trailhead is located on PR-988. This trail is the only one in the forest to be located in the municipality of Luquillo .  \\n\nThis trail is a 1.8 miles one-way trail that is considered to be very challenging, not necessarily for its steepness but for the denseness of the forest foliage it crosses. The trail crosses numerous small steams, waterfalls and a tabonuco tree forest and leads to the lush Mameyes Wild & Scenic River area. This is one of the rainiest parts of the national forest which means the trail is often muddy and slippery so appropriate hiking shoes are necessary. Due to the dense forest in the area, most disappearances in the forest occur along this trail so it is important not to walk off the trail under any circumstance. The trailhead is located on PR-191 .  \\n\nLa Mina Trail is a moderate to difficult 0.7-mile-long mile that starts on PR-191 close to the Palo Colorado Information Center. This is another popular hiking trail as it leads to La Mina Falls , one of the most picturesque waterfalls of the national forest. The trail also follows the course of La Mina River , also included in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System , and offers opportunities for swimming in the pool located by La Mina Falls. The trail is closed as of 2021 due to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017.  \\n\nThis is a paved mile-long self-guided interpretative trail that offers hikers the opportunity to come close to some of the largest trees in the national forest, the tabonuco tree (Dacryodes excelsa). Although paved the trail is considered moderate as it is steep in some sections. It ends in La Mina Falls close to a picnic area. The trail is closed as of 2021 due to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017.  \\n\nThis trail is one of the few to be located in the municipality of Naguabo , in the southern portion of the national forest. The trailhead is located on the southern section of PR-191 and it hosts bathrooms and a picnic area. The trail was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s and remained close for many decades but it was finally reopened in 2011 as part of the Sabana Recreation Area. This trail is considered difficult as it crosses dense forest and remote steep areas; it extends 2.2 miles and it connects to the El Toro and Tradewinds Trails in El Toro National Wilderness .  \\n\nEl Toro Wilderness Trail is one of the most remote and challenging trails in El Yunque National Forest. It extends for 2.9 miles on its paved section where it connects to the Río Sabana and the Tradewinds trails. When including the unpaved section (also known as the Tradewinds Trail), the trail extends for almost 5 miles and it leads to El Toro , which at 3,526 feet (1,075 m) is the highest point in both the national forest and eastern Puerto Rico. The trail crosses all four forest biomes through the municipalities of Canóvanas , Río Grande , Las Piedras (at El Toro\\'s summit) and Naguabo , fully within El Toro National Wilderness. This part of the national forest is the best ecologically preserved and it is home to numerous endemic and endangered species such as the Puerto Rican parrot , the Puerto Rican boa , the elfin woods warbler , the red fruit bat , and at least five species of coquis . The trailhead is located on PR-186 in a section of the road known as the El Toro Scenic Byway, in Cubuy, Canóvanas .   Both the El Toro and Tradewinds trails are listed as National Recreation Trails .   \\n\nEl Yunque National Forest offers many opportunities for swimming in natural pools often found at the base of waterfalls, such as that of La Mina Falls and the Juan Diego area off PR-191. Some areas available for swimming are the Quebrada Grande Recreation Area and the Espíritu Santo Observation Point off PR-186, the Sabana Recreation Area off the southern section of PR-191 in Naguabo, and the Angelito and Puente Roto Recreation Areas off PR-988 in Luquillo. Most of these areas are prone to flash flooding and as such they are often closed according to weather conditions.  \\n\nBaño Grande and Baño de Oro are two former swimming pools and recreational areas popular between the 1930s and 1960s.  These manmade pools were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the New Deal era by damming creeks belonging to the La Mina River watershed. They were closed due to a series of drownings and other safety issues. Although swimming is no longer possible at these pools, they are preserved as historic sites and have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places due to their historic and architectural value since 2017 and 2020, respectively.   Baño de Oro now serves as a watershed garden and Baño Grande is now a popular scenic spot.  \\n\nEl Portal Rainforest Center\nOpened in 1996, the El Portal Rainforest Center was designed by Segundo Cardona , FAIA of Sierra Cardona Ferrer Architects to give visitors an introduction to what the rainforest looks like. \\nBuilt on a 28,434-acre tropical forest, the Portal was built as a model headquarters for ecotourism and economic development and training, the center was built to educate those concerned about the wellbeing of the Caribbean National Forest and preserve the unique tropical forest heritage and environment.  It is located within the national forest in the municipality of Río Grande .\\n\nA walkway set at 60 feet (18 m) above the ground allows for a view of the tops of trees, and another walkway winds along tree bases. Exhibits at the center focus on the plants and animals of the rainforest, the importance of rainforests around the world, and threats to rainforests and efforts to conserve them.  \\n\nThe entry experience begins atop an elevated walkway that unites the facility with the surrounding forest and provides views to the mountain peaks, ocean and reforested terrain. The Center contains 9,000 square feet of exhibits, an enclosed theater, conference center classrooms and laboratories, as well as administrative offices. To preserve natural conditions, care was taken to use existing openings for roads, parking areas and buildings while the arrival sequence and parking lots were designed with contours to save existing trees.   \\n\nThe Portal has survived several major hurricanes including Hurricane Georges . On September 21, 2017, Hurricane Maria on caused major damages to the center and renovations are underway as of 2020.  El Portal Rainforest Center reopened to visitors in January 2022.  \\n\nMiscellaneous\nEl Yunque National Forest has been incorrectly called the only rainforest in the United States National Forest Service, [ note 1 ] but it is actually the only tropical rainforest.  There are others that are temperate rainforests including some in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .  \\n\nIn 2002, the U.S. Congress designated areas bounded by the Río Mameyes , Río de la Mina , and Río Icacos in the Caribbean National Forest as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System .  \\n\nContrary to the popular assumption, El Yunque Peak is not the highest mountain in either the Sierra de Luquillo or Puerto Rico. The highest mountain of the Sierra de Luquillo is El Toro , also located in the national forest, while the highest mountain in Puerto Rico is Cerro de Punta in the Cordillera Central on the border between Jayuya and Ponce .  \\n\nEl Yunque is also the object of Puerto Rican folklore and pop culture . Along with the coqui and the Puerto Rican parrot , El Yunque is considered a symbol of Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans . Along with the former two, it was chosen to be Puerto Rico\\'s entry in the America the Beautiful Quarters program. Puerto Rico\\'s only National Park Service site, San Juan National Historic Site had already been featured on the District of Columbia and United States Territories Quarters in 2009.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

[ a ]   Its irregular coastline features rocky cliffs, sandy beaches, and mangrove forests. Three smaller inlets gate the cavernous cove: \"Malena\" and \"Dakity\" to the west, and \"Mosquito\" to the east. A number of distinct coral specimens inhabit the area around Culebra, and some communities have flourished at the very bay\\'s entrance.  They form bars barely above sea level and block portions of its opening.\\n\nEnvironmental history\nFor most of the 20th century (1902-1975) the bay served as grounds for military training, as wreckage left from the time reveals. Explosions and the resulting contamination left pulverized underwater craters and diminished the health of sea life. But low-tech, community-based programs and coral grafting have expanded the reefs\\' fields and increased their bio-diversity.   The bay is today an eco-tourist destination, celebrated for its turtles, and the center of the local fishing industry.\\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences"

The Rev. James Van Buren came to Puerto Rico in February 1901 and on Christmas Eve of that year St. John\\'s became a parish with Van Buren as the first rector.  The cornerstone for the congregation\\'s first church was laid on December 26, 1902.  Old San Juan increasingly became a commercial center and its residents moved elsewhere.  In 1928 Bishop Charles Colmore proposed relocating St. John\\'s and St. Luke\\'s Church in new locations.  The following year the bishop spoke of St. John\\'s and St. Catherine\\'s Training School for Women relocating at Santurce with the hope that St. John\\'s Day School and the rectory would join them.

It is home to the Leones de Ponce team of the Puerto Rico Baseball League (LBPPR) and FC Leones of the Puerto Rico Soccer League (PRSL). The stadium has a capacity of 16,000 seats.    Construction of the stadium began in 1947 and it opened on 15 October 1949.  Montaner is the first stadium in Puerto Rico with an artificial surface field.   The stadium lies next to the Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium , where the Ponce Lions (basketball) hold their games. The Stadium was named to honor Francisco \"Paquito\" Montaner , one of the greatest Puerto Rican pitchers of all times.  \\n\nHistory\nWhile baseball had been practiced in the city prior to this, baseball in Ponce started in earnest upon the arrival of Americans to the island after the Spanish-American War of 1898.  The first non-professional baseball leagues played at Campo Atlético Charles H. Terry . After the formation of the Liga de Béisbol Semiprofesional de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Semiprofessional Baseball League) in 1938,  the sport had matured enough that it became necessary to consider building a new stadium. This need was strengthened on 14 September 1941 when the league became professional-level.  Construction of the stadium began in 1947 and it opened two years later on 15 October 1949.  In addition to baseball, the stadium was also used for basketball games. These were played on a convertible basketball court that was stowed away when the basketball games were over.  has killed?\\n\nUses\nThe PRPBL\\'s regular playing season runs from November through January. From February to August, the venue is transformed into a track and field stadium, and also serves as a venue for other activities such as a host of the Mustang Auto Daredevils. It has also been used for intramural competitions and other academic sporting events.  The track is completely covered during baseball season and then it is elevated via a hydraulic system for the track and field events.\\n\nThe stadium is also used for winter training by many United States Major Baseball League players.  In its early days, in particular, the stadium was used as the winter training stadium by the New York Yankees . In 1947, the game at the opening day of training was won 12 to 8 by the Leones de Ponce [ a ] v. New York Yankees.  News of the event first broke at the New York Daily News , followed by The New York Herald and The New York Times .   \\n\nMajor events\nMontaner has seen a total of 12 championships: four in BSN basketball (1952, 1961, 1964 y 1965), one in Double A (AA) baseball in 1957, six in Professional Baseball (68-69, 69-70, 71-72, 81-82, 03-04 and 08-09), and one in football in 2007.  \\n\nMontaner has also seen some great events in athletics. The Primeros Juegos Ponceños , the Frankie Colón Memorial, the Justas Intercolegiales (intercollegiate games), the Central American and Caribbean Games (\"Ponce 93\"), and the Iberoamerican Games, all took place here. There have also been athletics competitions at the Masters category and, more recently, the famed Ponce Grand Prix .  \\n\nFor many years Montaner was the venue of the finals of the Guantes Dorados de Boxeo Aficionado ( Amateur Boxing \\'s Golden Gloves), national as well as U.S.-based Professional Wrestling billboards , bull runs, concerts by internationally renowned artists, as well as the site of various major religious conventions.  In February 1958, evangelist Billy Graham hosted a religious event at this stadium.  \\n\nProminent Sportsmen at Montaner\nThrough Montaner, Ponce has been able to see prominent figures in the world of sports such as Francisco \\'Pancho\\' Coímbre , Felo Guilbe , Tomás \\'Planchardón\\' Quiñones, Luis Rodríguez Olmo , \\'Canena\\' Márquez , Carlos Bernier, José Guillermo \\'Pantalones\\' Santiago , Luis \\'Tite\\' Arroyo , Víctor Pellot , Roberto Clemente , Orlando \\'Peruchín\\' Cepeda , Willie Mays , Hank Aaron , Frank Robinson , José Rafael \\'Palillo\\' Santiago , Steve Carlton , John Boozer , Otoniel Vélez Franceschi , Roberto Alomar , Sandy Alomar Sr. , José \\'Cheo\\' Cruz , Rickey Henderson , José \\'Pepe\\' Mangual , Luis \\'Mambo\\' De León, Joey Cora , Juan \\'Igor\\' González , José Vidro , Iván Rodríguez , José Molina , Raúl Casanova , Javier López , and Javier Vázquez .

The stadium was named after boxer Sixto Escobar , the first champion of Puerto Rico, in 1938.  \\n\nOriginally built as a baseball venue, the stadium then became a frequent venue for football matches. In 1979, it was one of the three stadiums that served for the VIII Pan American Games held in San Juan . Nowadays, Sixto Escobar Stadium is the current home venue for C.A. San Juan.  \\n\nHistory\nThe stadium was inaugurated on November 12, 1932. Originally it was a baseball venue, and was built in an area then administrated by the U.S. Army . By the 1940s, a sector of the stadium, behind the baseball pitch, began to be used by some football enthusiasts. They played in a 100-metre length field known as canódromo (a track used for sighthound races). Some of the most notable Puerto Rican footballers of those times, started playing there.  \\n\nIn baseball, the Cincinnati Reds conducted spring training at the stadium in 1935 and 1936.  In April 1938, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico voted to name the stadium and surrounding park in honor of Sixto Escobar , a Puerto Rican professional boxer who became Puerto Rico\\'s first world champion.  A statue of Escobar stands on the grounds.\\n\nThe Miami Marlins were transferred to San Juan for the 1961 season and opened the season at Sixto Escobar Stadium.  Attendance was poor and the team was moved to Charleston, WV on May 19, 1961. The Cangrejeros de Santurce of the professional Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente moved out to the newly constructed Hiram Bithorn Stadium in 1962.\\n\nBy the 1970s the Sixto Escobar Stadium consolidated its predominance as a Puerto Rican football venue. In 1976 it was refurbished to host the 1976 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament , that also served as qualification for the 1977 FIFA World Youth Championship . Mexico and Honduras played the final at Sixto Escobar stadium on October 6.  Likewise, many events of the 1979 Pan American Games were held at the stadium. On July 4, Puerto Rico beat Dominican Republic 1-0 in front of a full attendance.  \\n\nIn 1981, the stadium hosted the \"Torneo 5 Estrellas\", an international football tournament where Real Madrid , Millonarios , Pumas UNAM , a regional side of United States and local club Internacional de Puerto Rico participated. From the 1970s to early 2000s the stadium was a frequent venue of Puerto Rico national football team matches.  \\n\nIn 2000 the Sixto Escobar Stadium hosted all six matches of the inaugural Torneo de Copa de Puerto Rico .  The Copa featured a mix of club and national teams and was hosted by the Puerto Rican Football Federation and the Puerto Rico national team.  The international competition was played over the course of a week\\'s time, consisting of three nights of double-headers. The MLS side, Tampa Bay Mutiny were the winners.  \\n\nIn 2011 the stadium was repaired and improved to accommodate the new tenant football team River Plate Puerto Rico ,  but the club never played there.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\n\\n\nThis article about a sports venue in Puerto Rico is a stub .

In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Fajardo Pueblo was 3,414.  \\n \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nThe Catedral Santiago Apóstol is located in Fajardo barrio-pueblo.  The parish was established in 1766  and the first church building was completed in 1776.  It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1867 .  Construction of the present church began two years later utilizing the side walls and floor tiles of the previous church.  It became a cathedral church when Pope Benedict XVI established the Diocese of Fajardo-Humacao on March 11, 2008.  It is list on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\n\\n\nThis Fajardo, Puerto Rico location article is a stub . You can help Wikipedia by expanding it ."

        "page_content": "Contents\nFarmers\\' market\nA farmers\\' market (or farmers market according to the AP stylebook ,   also farmer\\'s market in the Cambridge Dictionary   ) is a physical retail marketplace intended to sell foods directly by farmers to consumers. Farmers\\' markets may be indoors or outdoors and typically consist of booths, tables or stands where farmers sell their produce, live animals and plants , and sometimes prepared foods and beverages. Farmers\\' markets exist in many countries worldwide and reflect the local culture and economy. The size of the market may be just a few stalls or it may be as large as several city blocks. Due to their nature, they tend to be less rigidly regulated than retail produce shops.  \\n\nThey are distinguished from public markets , which are generally housed in permanent structures, open year-round, and offer a variety of non-farmer/non-producer vendors, packaged foods and non-food products.   \\n\nHistory\nThe current concept of a farmers\\' market is similar to past concepts, but different in relation to other forms - as aspects of consumer retailing , overall, continue to shift over time. Similar forms existed before the Industrial Age , but often formed part of broader markets, where suppliers of food and other goods gathered to retail their wares. Trading posts began in 1930s, a shift toward retailers who sold others\\' products more than their own. General stores and grocery stores continued that specialization trend in retailing, optimizing the consumer experience,  while abstracting it further from production and from production\\'s growing complexities. [ citation needed ] \\n\nModern industrial food production\\'s advantages over prior methods depend largely on modern, cheap, fast transport and limited product variability.  But transport costs and delays cannot be eliminated. So where distance strained industrial suppliers\\' reach, where consumers had strong preference for local variety, farmers\\' markets remained competitive with other forms of food retail. Starting in the mid-2000s, consumer demand for foods that are fresher (spend less time in transit) and for foods with more variety\\xe2\\x80\\x94has led to growth of farmers\\' markets as a food-retailing mechanism.\\n\nBenefits\nFarmers\\' markets can offer farmers increased profit over selling to wholesalers, food processors, or large grocery firms. By selling directly to consumers, produce often needs less transport, less handling, less refrigeration and less time in storage. By selling in an outdoor market, the cost of land, buildings, lighting and air-conditioning is also reduced or eliminated. Farmers may also retain profit on produce not sold to consumers, by selling the excess to canneries and other food-processing firms. At the market, farmers can retain the full premium for part of their produce, instead of only a processor\\'s wholesale price for the entire lot. However, other economists say \"there are relatively few benefits in terms of energy efficiency, quality or cost ... fun though they are, are not good economic models.\"  \\n\nSome farmers prefer the simplicity, immediacy, transparency and independence of selling direct to consumers.  One method noted by the special interest group Food Empowerment Project promotes community-supported agriculture programs (CSAs).  In this scheme, consumers pay farms seasonally or monthly to receive weekly or biweekly boxes of produce.  Alternatively, they may be required to pay for an entire season\\'s worth of produce in advance of the growing season. In either case, consumers risk losing their money if there is a crop failure.  \\n\nAmong the benefits often touted for communities with farmers\\' markets:\\n\nReduced transport, storage, and refrigeration can benefit communities too:\\n\nFarmers\\' markets may also contribute to innovative distribution means that strengthen civic engagement by reducing the social distances between urban and rural communities. With fewer intermediaries, the support of independent growers by local community members can enhance local economic opportunities and health & wellness in poor communities.  \\n\nSome consumers may favor farmers\\' markets for the perceived:\\n\nEvidence seems to show that overall prices at a typical farmers\\' market are lower than prices at a supermarket because the process of production is more concise; there is less distance to travel, and fewer middlemen.  \\n\nRegional emphasis\nThe traditional public markets in Chinese cities are known as \" wet markets \" (\\xe8\\x8f\\x9c\\xe5\\xb8\\x82\\xe5\\x9c\\xba) where most vendors are resellers. The Chinese government has attempted to transform these traditional markets to supermarkets in urban renovation projects. It has led to a decline of these markets in some cities such as Shanghai.  Yet, in other cities, wet markets persist and dominate the retail of fresh produce and meat. Because of its critical role in ensuring urban food security, wet markets receive various supports from the local government.  \\n\nAfter 2010, farmers\\' markets in China were reborn in some major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu amidst the food safety crisis. These farmers\\' markets (\\xe5\\x86\\x9c\\xe5 4 b\\xe5\\xb8\\x82\\xe9\\x9b\\x86) provide venues for local small ecological farmers to sell their produce within the city, catering urban middle-class\\'s growing demand for high quality food. Many of these market vendors are operating community-supported agriculture .  \\n\nThe EU has formalized efforts to expand farmers\\' markets to reduce food safety risks and poor nutrition through programs known as \"Farm to Fork\".  \\n\nFarm-to-fork was developed with three main goals within the EU: \\n\nSince the first farmers\\' market was established in the UK in 1997, the number has grown to over 550 nationwide.  A number of factors led to the rise of farmers\\' markets in the UK in the late 1990s, including the increasing knowledge of consumers, the struggles of British farmers, anti-French sentiment, and concerns over food safety and quality.  Consumers were worried about the farming practices by which food is produced, processed and the health and safety aspects of certain foods. The emergence of books, magazine articles, and cookery and gardening programmes influence consumer concern of food preparation and consumption.  \\n\nDue in part to the increased interest in healthier foods, a greater desire to preserve local cultivars or livestock (some of which may not be up to commercial shipping or yield standards) and an increased understanding of the importance of maintaining small, sustainable farms on the fringe of urban environments, farmers\\' markets in the US have grown from 1,755 in 1994 to 4,385 in 2006,  to 5,274 in 2009,  to 8,144 in 2013.  In New York City , there are 107 farmers\\' markets in operation.  In the Los Angeles area, 88 farmers\\' markets exist,  many of which support Hispanic and Asian fare.\\n\nIn the U.S., all levels of government have provided funding to farmers\\' markets, for instance, through the federal programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children , the Farmers\\' Market Nutrition Program , and the Senior Farmers\\' Market Nutrition Program .  The programs primarily subsidize purchases at farmers\\' markets by low-income residents.   Examples include Austin\\'s Double Dollar Incentive Program, Boston\\'s Bounty Bucks, Chicago\\'s LINK Up, Columbia Heights Festibucks in Washington, D.C., Fresh Checks in East Palo Alto, Market Match in Los Angeles, Michigan\\'s Double Up Food Bucks, New York City\\'s Health Bucks, Portland Fresh Exchange, and Seattle Fresh Bucks.  These programs often rely in part on nonprofit support.  \\n\nManagement\nA wide range of organizations initiate, organize, and manage farmers\\' markets, including farmers\\' groups, community groups, local governments, etc.\\n\nSome markets are strictly managed, with rules for pricing, quality and vendor selection. Others are much more relaxed in their operations and vendor criteria. While the usual emphasis is on locally grown food products, some farmers\\' markets allow co-ops and purveyors, or allow farmers to purchase some products to resell.\\n\nThere have been recent reports of fraud and products mislabeled as organic or locally grown when they are not.  In some cases, fraudulent farmers\\' markets sell regular grocery store vegetables, passing them off as organic or locally grown, to which are usually sold to unsuspecting tourists. [ citation needed ] \\n\nSome farmers\\' markets have wholesale operations, sometimes limited to specific days or hours. One such wholesale farmers\\' market is the South Carolina State Farmers Market,  which is a major supplier of watermelons , cantaloupes , and peaches for produce buyers in the north-eastern US. Farmers\\' markets also may supply buyers from produce stands, restaurants , and garden stores with fresh fruits and vegetables , plants, seedlings and nursery stock, honey , and other agricultural products. Although this is on the decline, in part due to the growth of chain stores that desire national distribution networks and cheap wholesales prices\\xe2\\x80\\x94prices driven down by the low cost of imported produce.\\n\nProduct categories\nA wide variety of beef and pork products are sold at farmers\\' markets in the United States. Typical beef products include steaks, ground beef, jerky, and various types of beef sausage. Typical pork products include sausage and bacon.\\n\nBeef and pork products sold at farmers\\' market in the US, like those of any other beef/pork product that are sold to the public, must originate from livestock slaughtered in a government (federal or state) inspected slaughterhouse.  Since government inspected slaughterhouses purchase livestock for slaughter, many often have the facilities, equipment, and personnel to supply meat products to distributors/wholesalers. Like restaurants, such arrangements are popular with farmers\\' market vendors because they allow them to avoid the overhead costs (facility, equipment, knowledge, maintenance, food safety inspections, etc.) associated with producing meat products that may be legally sold to the public.   Resell vendors are in the majority at farmers\\' markets while vendors that make and package their own meat products represent a very small percentage. Reselling allows vendors to minimize investment and overhead costs by purchasing their products from a commercial slaughterhouse and/or processing plant.   \\n\nMeat products at farmers\\' markets being sold by resellers will include a \"distributed by/packed for\", or similar, statement on the labels of their meat products. Conversely, meat products being sold at farmers\\' markets that are prepared and packaged by the selling vendor will not include a \"distributed by/packed for\", or similar, statement.  \\n\nUnprocessed meat (retail cut) products found at farmers\\' markets may include a government inspection legend plus a \"distributed by/packed for/prepared for\" label. Other information on the label will include weight, price, and safe handling instructions.\\n\nThe official inspection legend includes an establishment number (EST) that identifies the last company that did the processing/butchering, packaging, and labeling of the product. Since the label includes the \"distributed by/packed for\" statement, the meat may come from the livestock of other farmers/ranchers or a corporate feedlot . The presence of a government inspection legend identifies a meat product that was not processed and packed by the selling vendor. Meat products prepared and packed by the selling vendor or butcher will not include a government seal, and will not include any type of statement that classifies the vendor as a reseller/distributor.  \\n\nThe labels on retail beef and pork products that originate a vendor\\'s/rancher\\'s livestock will not include the \"distributed by/packed for/prepared for\" statement. Note that the label will still have an official/government Inspection Legend that identifies the establishment that performed the slaughtering, butchering, packaging, and labeling because any product leaving a slaughterhouse to be sold for human consumption must have a government inspection legend. For example, a label that does not have a \"distributed by/packed for\", etc. statement ensures the buyer that, while the vendor did not do the butchering/packaging/etc., the meat did originate from the vendor\\'s livestock.\\n\nThe label on a meat product that is processed and packed by the selling vendor will not include a government inspection legend and it will not include a \"distributed by/packed for\" statement.\\n\nRetail cuts of meat products sold by a vendor that performs its own butchering, packaging, and labeling will not include a government inspection legend or a \"distributed by/packed for\" statement on the label. In such cases the vendor/butcher gets the carcass or other major cuts of meat from a government inspected slaughterhouse and does the secondary butchering (\"fabrication\"), packaging, and labeling in its own facility. A government official inspection legend is not required on a package of meat butchered and packaged by such a vendor because it is sold directly to the consumer.\\n\nMost processed meat products (sausage, bacon, hot dogs, frankfurters, snack sticks) sold at farmers\\' markets have labels that include a \"distributed by/packed for/etc.\" statement as well as a government inspection legend. The government inspection legend includes an establishment number (EST #) that identifies the commercial processing plant that made and packaged the products; similar to a package of sausage or bacon sold in supermarkets .  Alternately, a processed meat product sold at a farmers\\' market that does not include a \"distributed by/packed for/etc.\" statement and a government inspection legend is a product that is made and packaged by the selling vendor. There are also vendors that sell processed meat products that include a government inspection legend without a \"distributed by/packed for/etc.\" statement; such vendors are selling co-pack products in which the maker/producer prepares and packages the product according to the vendors\\' recipe.  \\n\nWholesale processed meat products that are resold at farmers\\' markets are known as \"private label\" products.   Such products will include a \"distributed by/packed for/etc.\" statement plus a government inspection legend that provides a number that identifies the product\\'s producer. The numbers of critics of private label products are increasing as consumers become aware of poor practices often employed by the products\\' producers.  \\n\nIt is not unusual to find distributors/resellers of processed meat products at farmers\\' markets because wholesale products allow vendors to minimize their investment by not having to pay for the overhead (knowledge, skills, equipment, supplies, maintenance, food safety inspections, packaging, labeling, etc.) required to produce their own products. A wholesale package of processed meat will bear a label that has a government inspection legend. The inspection legend will usually have an Establishment Number (EST #) that identifies the processing plant that made and packaged the product. Additionally, the package will contain a phrase similar to \"distributed by: Steve\\'s Family Meat Company\" or \"packed/prepared for Steve\\'s Family Meat Company\" somewhere on the label. Both the producer (identified by the EST. # in the inspection legend) and distributor/reseller (for example Steve\\'s Family Meat Company) will be identified on the label.\\n\nA product label of a farmers\\' market vendor that makes and packages its own product will not include a \"distributed by/packed for/etc.\" statement, and it will not have a government inspection legend because its products are sold directly to the consumer.  Information on the producing vendor\\'s label will include the following information:\\n\nIt will not include a government inspection legend or seal.\\n\nIdeally, farmers\\' market produce and fruit are normally grown within a geographical region that is deemed local by the market\\'s management. The term \" local \" is defined by the farmers\\' market and usually represents products grown within a given radius measured in miles or kilometers.  Many farmers\\' markets state that they are \"producer only\" markets, and that their vendors grow all products sold. Some farmers\\' markets do not use the term \"producer only\" and may allow resellers of produce, fruit, and other food products.\\n\nSome farmers\\' markets allow vendors to resell vegetables and fruits if they are not available locally due to the time of the year. Vegetables, fruit, meat, and other products resold at farmers\\' markets are available to vendors through food distributors .  This is a common practice and provides consumers with produce and fruit that are unavailable at certain times of the year. In many markets resell items are a permanent part of the vendor\\'s inventory.\\n\nThere are four subject areas that consumers tend to consider when purchasing food directly from the producer:\\n\nAll vegetables and fruits have unique names that distinguish them from any other, whether they are for commercial use, for home gardening, or heirloom . A number or alphanumeric string usually identifies the newer commercial varieties.   Vendors\\' employees might not always know the variety names of the produce they are selling but they will be able to get a list from their employer (producer). There are vendors that violate rules by reselling products at Producer Only markets.   \\n\nDepending on the farmers\\' markets, a wide variety of products are available. Poultry, lamb, goat, eggs, milk, cream, ice cream, butter, cheese , honey, syrup, jams, jellies, sauces, mushrooms, flowers, wool, wine, beer, breads, and pastries are some examples of vendor produced products sold at farmers\\' markets. Many farmers\\' markets allow vendors to prepare and sell ready to eat foods and drinks.   \\n\nFraud\nSome investigations in the United States and Canada have found shops in farmers markets selling fruits and vegetables not sourced from their own farms.  In September 2017, a hidden camera investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation found that some of the stalls in one market purchased produce on the wholesale market and removed the original stickers, raising the cost to 50% above the retail prices.   \\n\nTampa Bay Times food critic and investigative reporter Laura Reiley found  some vendors at local farmers\\' markets selling rejected produce from local wholesale markets, or selling produce purchased from non-local sources. In some cases they claimed to sell products from their own farm at first, but when pressed admitted that they had grown none of the products for sale. In at least one case, despite vendor claims to the contrary, the farm in question was not growing any food, and the produce was all purchased from other companies. Fraud may sometimes be obvious because the type of food being sold does not grow locally or is out of season. Federal regulations in the United States require country of origin labeling for produce at supermarkets but not for small independent vendors. [ citation needed ] \\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times also found that packaged foods, such as sauces, honey, jam, and beef jerky may appear to be from local vendors due to the local company\\'s branding on the packaging, but are actually produced at co-packer plants with non-local ingredients. In the United States, the FDA requires that the manufacturer\\'s name and address be listed on the food label, which can reveal this discrepancy.\\n\nHealth risks\nFood safety regulations often carve out exceptions for farmers\\' markets. In the United States, for example, if the produce does not cross state lines it is exempt from the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act . Farmers markets increase the number of outbreaks and cases of food-borne illness , norovirus , and campylobacter .  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCardona Island Light\n\\n\nCardona Island Light (also known as Faro del Puerto de Ponce or Cayo Cardona Light ) is the only 6th order lighthouse in Puerto Rico with a cylindrical attached tower.  The light is located on Cardona Island , a small island on the west side of the entrance to the harbor of Ponce, Puerto Rico . It was listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 22 October 1981 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2001.  \\n\nLocation\nThe light is located on a small 6-acre (2.4 ha) key, west of Ponce Harbor . Cayo Cardona Light is the western minor light that together with Guánica Light connects Los Morrillos Light and Caja de Muertos Light and guides the entrance to the Port of Ponce . The island is accessible only by private boat, but it can be seen from the observation tower on the La Guancha boardwalk . It is not open to the public.\\n\nIt was first lit in 1889 and automated in 1962. In 1942, during World War II , its use was discontinued, but was relighted again on 10 November 1943.  The light is still an active aid to navigation.  \\n\nSignificance\nTogether with Guánica Light , Cardona Light is the western minor light which connects Cabo Rojo Light and Caja de Muertos Light and guides the entrance to a port that, during the course of last century, exported millions of pounds of sugar particularly to the United States . Architecturally, it is significant that it is the only 6th order lighthouse with a cylindrical attached tower. Also, the original brick roof and firewood beams are practically intact.  \\n\nDescription\nThe lighthouse was built of stone and brick and intended for one second class keeper. The light, built in 1889, guides the entrance to the Port of Ponce , as a 6th order red fixed light.  \\n\nStructurally, it followed the same construction as three other minor lights on the south and southeast shores: Punta Figuras , Punta Mulas , and Puerto Ferro . It lacks, though, the distinctive decorative elements of non-existing Punta Higuero or ruinous Guernica. Nevertheless, it possesses a charm of its own: a petite neo-classic symmetrically-balanced official design.  \\n\nCayo Cardona\\'s dwelling was designed of stone and brick for one 2nd class keeper. A 33-foot (10 m) circular tower was attached to its south facade. The structure measures some 48\\' x 30\\' x 16\\'. Its main entrance is on the north facade which opened into a room arrangement similar to the other minor structures of the light house and described further below. The fact that no plans of this structure have been found, and that its interior has been closed off with cement makes it difficult to describe. Only secondary references, a late 19th-century photo of the site, and official references to the similar or identical design of the minor lights allows a reserved description of this particular site.  \\n\nThe c. 1898 photo available depicts a simple neo-classic building with a rather elaborate cornice and a simple roof parapet . Contrary to other minor lights, the tower is cylindrical, crowned by another cornice less elaborated than the dwelling\\'s. The photograph states that the structure was painted white and light blue.  \\n\nThe tower\\'s cast-iron stairway led to an octagonal glass, copper, and cast-iron lantern with vertical bars and a cast-iron balustrade surrounding an exterior cement gallery.  \\n\nThe original illuminating apparatus, still in use, is an 1888, 6th order fixed red lenticular lens manufactured by Sautter, Lemonnier & Company of France. It is 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter. The lens has four panels, with five elements in each panel of the central drum, and five prisms on each panel above the central drum and two below. It was held in place by a cast-iron pedestal . The original light was colored by a red chimney.  The original light characteristics were modified in 1922 and 1938. In 1962 it was electrified and, apparently, unmanned.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nCaja de Muertos Light\n\\n\nCaja de Muertos Light , ( Faro de la Isla de Caja de Muertos )  is an 1887 lighthouse in Ponce, Puerto Rico , that is unique amongst all other lighthouses in Puerto Rico for its unusual Cross of Lorraine , double-arm, T-type shape structure.  The historic lighthouse is located on Caja de Muertos , an uninhabited island off the coast of Ponce, Puerto Rico . The light stands at the highest point of the island.\\n\nHistory\nThe light was built in 1887 by the colonial government of Spain to serve as a 3rd order lighthouse . The original lighting apparatus was built by Sautter, Lemonnier & Company lens in 1885. In 1945 the lighting was automated.  The lighthouse was restored by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources and houses a lookout and a museum. In 2009, the government of Puerto Rico announced plans to make Caja de Muertos Island and this lighthouse a priority of the department.   \\n\nThe Faro de la Isla de Caja de Muertos is a major light and unique architectural structure within the Spanish Lighthouse system, as well as under American rule.\\n\nSignificance\nThe structure is important because it is unique amongst all other lighthouses in Puerto Rico in that it has an unusual Lorraine cross , double-arm, T-type shape.  The light is somewhat similar to the Isla Culebrita Light \"but, in itself, is a major example of a variation within the central theme of utilitarian functions and aesthetical interpretation.\"  \\n\nArchitectural style\nThe light stands atop of the highest point of Caja de Muertos, Puerto Rico . The most catchy characteristic of the lighthouse is its unique and unusual Lorraine cross double-arm \"T\" shape.  \\n\nWithin this structure, the main entrance opens to a small vestibule. The vestibule in itself is a section of a 12 x 1 meter long corridor which led to the keeper\\'s quarters. The entrance to the tower, which has a 3.9 meter square base located in the center of the structure, is across the main entrance. On both sides of the tower base there were two 4.74m x 4.55m rooms one which served as the engineer\\'s room and the other as a storeroom. North of the tower base the oil room was located. This one measures 3.6m x 1.5m. Therefore, from west to east a structural connection is formed by the storeroom, towers\\' base, oil room, engineer\\'s room, and the corridor. This section links the keeper\\'s quarters. These were arranged into two parallel sections running north to south and oriented of identical dimensions.  \\n\nIn order of disposition, first, came the living room, measuring 4.9m x 3.4m, followed by two sleeping rooms, measuring 3.5m x 3.5m each, and a kitchen-dining area, also 3.5m x 3.5m. The last three rooms connected to an 8.9m x 1m long corridor which reached the bathrooms. Each living room had three windows, the kitchens have two windows, and the dormitories, storeroom, and engineer\\'s quarters had one window each.  \\n\nThe tower is a massive cylindrical structure, of 19m high\\xe2\\x80\\x94including the lantern\\xe2\\x80\\x94by a 2.5m inside diameter. It terminates in rectangular bracket-supporters for the cement circular gallery and cast-iron balustrade that encloses the cast-iron, copper, and glass 3rd order lantern. A cast-iron spiral stairway also led to the lantern that had vertical bars.  \\n\nThe original illuminating apparatus was an 1885, lenticular 3rd order lens, manufactured by Sautter, Lemonnier & Company of France. The central drum measured 1 meter in diameter. It had six panels of which three were flashing panels. In each panel of the central drum there were seven elements; each panel above central drum had eleven prisms and four prisms below. The flashes were produced by the central revolving drum mounted on a chariot activated by a clock work system. The clock cord descended through the central column in the stairway. The mechanism was protected by a circular iron and glass case. The original light characteristic showed a white flash every 3 seconds and had an 18-mile range. In 1923 the light characteristics were changed. In 1945 the light was electrified. It was also changed into an automatic, unwatched light that exhibited the original characteristics. The structure was abandoned and boarded up. The lens was replaced by a 500mm lens. No record has been found which indicates that major structural changes or alterations were introduced in the dwelling. The decorative elements are purely neo-classic especially its cornices and pediment.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nFlamenco Beach\nFlamenco Beach is a public beach on the Caribbean island of Culebra . It is known for its shallow turquoise waters, white sand, swimming areas, and diving sites. It stretches for a mile around a sheltered, horseshoe-shaped bay. Playa Flamenco is a popular beach destination for both Culebra and Puerto Rico. In March 2014, Flamenco Beach was ranked 3rd best beach in the world with a TripAdvisor Travelers\\' Choice Award .   In August 2016, it was announced that Flamenco Beach had regained its Blue Flag Beach international distinction.  \\n\nGeography\nFlamenco is located on the northern shore of Culebra. Its name in Spanish ( flamingo beach ) comes from the numerous Caribbean flamingos ( Phoenicopterus ruber ) that were once common in Flamenco Lagoon .  The beach lies on a half-mile-wide, horseshoe strip of coast. The beach is bordered by the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge , which is of itself one of the oldest wildlife preserves in the United States. Off the coast of Flamenco, approximately a quarter mile, is a reef where the surf breaks. Characteristic of Flamenco is the beach\\'s white sand and shallow clear waters.   \\n\nThe waters off Flamenco beach are home to species of parrot fish , blue tang , multiple species of wrasse , and other Caribbean Sea fish species. Crustacean species such as Ghost Crab are also observed. Some 50,000 seabirds visit Culebra\\'s Flamenco Peninsula each summer to nest\\xe2\\x80\\x94mostly sooty terns and other migratory species. Summer visitors to Flamenco Beach are familiar with them as they often feed in the area in large numbers. By September, the birds have gathered up their broods and flown out to sea only to return home the following summer. Occasionally, leatherback and hawksbill sea turtles may be seen as the beaches of the Culebra archipelago are also a major breeding ground for them and the adjacent sea grass beds provide shelter and food for green sea turtles.  \\n\nOne of the most distinctive views of the beach include two rusting carcasses of old M4 Sherman tanks that were left behind   by the United States Navy after their departure from Flamenco Beach in 1975, which was used as a weapons-testing ground by them for more than 30 years. While the salty winds from the sea worked on the metal, causing it to rapidly rust and crumble apart, the locals and visitors often decorate them, covering the badly corroded hulks in layers of colorful graffiti. Today, the tanks still remain and have become a unique feature of the otherwise pristine and beautiful beach.   \\n\nGallery\nTourism\nFlamenco Beach is the top ranked beach in Puerto Rico and one of the top beaches in the world. The beach has available lifeguard towers, kiosks selling food, beach accessories, and easy access from the town of Dewey (where the ferry boat arrives).   \\n\nThe beach has bathroom facilities and showers. There are about a half-dozen kiosks selling local food. This include piña colada , mango smoothies, rice-and-beans burritos and all manner of seafood, from conch salad to fish skewers.  Flamenco Beach has a designated camping area for a fee which provides potable water, bathrooms and shower facilities.\\n\nRecreation\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nFlorida, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nFlorida  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the karst region north of Ciales , south of Barceloneta , east of Arecibo , and west of Manatí . Florida is not like other municipalities of Puerto Rico with multiple subdivisions called barrios. It has one barrio called Florida Adentro and two other subdivisions: Florida Zona Urbana and Pajonal comunidad . It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nFlorida was founded first as a barrio of Barceloneta in 1881 when a priest named Father Carrión, the mayor of Barceloneta, and other dignitaries visited a tract of land of almost 4 acres. They decided to establish a new barrio. The owner of the land, Don Manuel Cintrón, granted the land while he retained a piece of it. The barrio was first called Florida Adentro .  \\n\nDuring the 20th century, several efforts were made to declare Florida as a municipality . First, on April 14, 1949, House Representative Francisco Díaz Marchand presented a project to create a legislative commission that would study the economic and social conditions of the barrio, to determine the suitability of it as an independent municipality. The project was unsuccessful. In 1960, Manuel Frías Morales presented a law that would permit the study to establish the municipality but it was also unsuccessful.\\n\nFinally, on June 14, 1971, the Senate of Puerto Rico and Governor Don Luis A. Ferré approved the law that officially created the municipality of Florida. It is thus the youngest municipality established in the island.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Florida, 1400 homes were a total loss and 2,295 homes were partially damaged.  \\n\nGeography\nFlorida is the second smallest municipality of Puerto Rico, with an area of 10 square miles. As the only municipality in Puerto Rico that has its urban area within the northern karst region (sometimes referred as the Northern Karst Hills ), it is surrounded by low elevation, red clay and limestone haystack hills known in Caribbean Spanish as mogotes . The southern border of the municipality with Ciales remains one of the least developed areas on the island, due to the ruggedness of the karst. The Río Encantado , a subterranean river, drains this area.  Several caves are found in the town, including Román Cave, Miró Cave, and Juana Gómez Cave.  Balcon Cave ( Cueva Balcón ) is located in Florida.  \\n\nAs with all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Florida is subdivided into administrative units called barrios (which means barrios or boroughs or neighborhoods in English). A newer municipality of Puerto Rico, Florida has one barrio called Florida Adentro and two sub-barrios: Florida Zona Urbana and Pajonal. It does not have a \"barrio-pueblo\" like most of the other municipalities of Puerto Rico.    \\n\nThe following areas are neighborhoods in Florida:\\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.      For all\\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Florida: Sector El Hoyo in Comunidad San Agustín, Comunidad Arroyo, Sector Polvorín in Comunidad La Ceiba, Comunidad La Fuente, Estancias de Arroyo in La Joya, Sector El Cerro in Pajonal, and Sectors La Charca and Los Quemaos (both) in Parcelas Selgas.  \\n\nCulture and tourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Florida page lists Parque Ecológico Janet González , Río Encantado , and Bandera de Puerto Rico of the project Una Bandera, 78 Pueblos (One Flag, 78 Pueblos), as places of interest.  \\n\nFlorida celebrates its patron saint festival in September. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Florida include:\\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Florida\\'s economy relied heavily on agriculture, specifically pineapple crops and other fruit-related products. In recent decades, along with the rest of the Island, rapid urbanization and industrialization, along with economic challenges, have forced Florida\\'s fruit industry to near extinction.  Pharmaceutical manufacturing plants have been established in Florida.   \\n\nDemographics\nFlorida is one of the least populated municipalities of Puerto Rico, perhaps due to its small size. The population, according to the 2000 census, was 12,237 with a population density of 1,236.7 people per square mile (475.6/km 2 ). After its establishment in 1974, the population has steadily increased over the years, with 7,232 people in the 1980 census.\\n\nStatistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 86.0% of Florideños are of White origin, 4.9% are black , 0.2% are Amerindian etc.\\n\nGovernment\nAfter its initial establishment, Florida belonged to the Barceloneta region.  In 1949 and 1960 there were some attempts to separate the barrio from Barceloneta, but these were unsuccessful. However, in 1974, Governor Luis A. Ferré and the Puerto Rican Senate officially declared Florida an independent municipality. Its first mayor was Jorge L. Pérez Piñeiro. The current mayor is José Gerena Polanco , of the New Progressive Party (PNP). He was elected in the 2012 general elections .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district III , which is represented by two Senators. In 2008, José Emilio González and Angel Martínez were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nIt consists of three horizontal stripes, with the following colors and widths: green the superior and white the inferior, with five modules of width each one, the center one red, with a width of one module.  \\n\nField of silver, in an abyss, a gules (red) anchored cross, like the one in the Asturian district of Llanes . The cross is anchored between two branches of bloomed poinsettias ( Poinsettia pulcherrima ). A green terrace represents the hilly terrain of the town, with a stripe forming waves outlined in silver which represents the underground river of Encantado. At the top, a three tower gold crown distinct in municipalities coat of arms. The shield can be surrounded, to its flanks and bottom by two crossed coffee tree branches with fruits.  \\n\nFlorida derives its name from the abundant flowers and natural resources on its land. It is also known as La Tierra del Río Encantado due to an underground river called Encantado. Another nickname is the Pueblo de la Piña Cayenalisa due to its pineapple crops.\\n\nEducation\nThere are several public and private schools, serving students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade, distributed throughout the municipality of Florida. Public education is handled by the Puerto Rico Department of Education . \\nThese are some of the schools in Florida, as of 2020:  \\n\nTransportation\nPuerto Rico Highway 22 provides access to PR-140 , which leads to Florida from the cities of Mayagüez in the west, or San Juan in the north.\\n\nLike most other towns on the Island, it has a public transportation system consisting of small, subsidized private buses and vans called públicos .  \\n\nThere is only one bridge in Florida.  \\n\nMayors of Florida\nNotable Florideños\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

It is located in the metropolitan area of the capital, San Juan .\\n\nHistory\nPuerto Rico was part of the Spanish Empire from the time of Christopher Columbus until the Spanish-American War . United States forces landed in Guánica on July 25, 1898. The last Spanish unit left the island the following October, and the Department of Puerto Rico was established. Upon the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the Congress of the United States. In 1901 the island was designated to be an unincorporated United States territory by the Supreme Court of the United States in a controversial decision in the case of Downes Vs. Bidwell, the first of several Insular Cases.\\n\nOn July 1, 1899, \"The Puerto Rico Regiment of Infantry, United States Army\" was created. On July 1, 1901, Lieutenant Colonel James Anderson Buchanan took command of the regiment. He was later promoted to colonel on July 21, 1902, and to brigadier general in 1905. Buchanan served in Puerto Rico from 1898 to 1903 and Fort Buchanan was named after him.\\n\nThe Puerto Rico Regiment was officially designated as the 65th Infantry Regiment in 1920, after defending the Canal Zone during World War I . A tract of 300 acres approximately six miles on the south shore of San Juan Bay was acquired to provide the regiment with a training area. The site was established in 1923 as Camp Buchanan. It served as a target range and maneuver area for the U.S. Army and National Guard troops from 1923 to 1939. The 1st Battalion 51st Coast Artillery Regiment was also assigned to Camp Buchanan in 1939.\\n\nIn May 1940 the location was renamed Fort Buchanan. It was eventually expanded to 4,500 acres. During World War II, Fort Buchanan housed a depot supplying the Army Antilles Department. It also processed local troops through its replacement center. The industrial complex included pier facilities, ammunition storage areas and an extensive railroad network connecting the military installation to the Port of San Juan at San Juan Bay.\\n\nPuerto Rican soldiers being deployed during World War II and the Korean War were transported from the train station to the Army terminal at the Port of San Juan. At the time, Fort Buchanan served as a citizens training camp and soldier processing station.\\n\nAfter World War II the post was gradually reduced to its current size of 746 acres. Fort Buchanan remained a command depot with post facilities, a personnel center, and a special training center until closure as an Army post in 1966. On December 31, 1966, with the deactivation of the Antilles Command, Fort Buchanan passed to the control of the United States Navy .\\n\nOn December 7, 1971, the Third U.S. Army resumed control of Fort Buchanan, and in 1973 the post came under direct control of the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM). Following the Department of Defense Unified Command Plan, Fort Buchanan came under control of United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). From 1999 to 2003 it was occupied by United States Army South (USARSO).\\n\nIn 2002 Fort Buchanan became part of the Southeast Regional Office of the Installation Management Agency (IMA), and in 2003 it became an IMA Reserve installation. In 2006 it became a garrison under United States Army Installation Management Command , Southeast Region (IMCOM-SE).\\n\nOn October 1, 2008, the Commanding General of the 81st Readiness Division became Fort Buchanan\\'s Senior Mission Commander under the United States Army Reserve Command (USARC).  Based on the December 2008 Unified Command Plan, Fort Buchanan currently falls under the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) area of operations, under the direct control of the Installation Management Command, Atlantic Region (IMCOM-Atlantic).\\n\nOn October 23, 2009, an explosion at the nearby Caribbean Petroleum Corporation caused two people to suffer minor injuries at Fort Buchanan, and four other people sought help for respiratory problems. The explosion caused minor damages in some facilities of the military installation.  \\n\nIn 2017 after the wake of Hurricane Maria , Fort Buchanan served as a command center during the recovery efforts. Military active duty, reserve and National Guard units from the continental United States were mobilized from Fort Buchanan all over the island for the emergency. Thousands of these service members were awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for their disaster relief efforts. The United States Army Corps of Engineers also managed operations from Fort Buchanan.

        "page_content": "Contents\nFortín de San Gerónimo\nFortín de San Gerónimo de Boquerón is a small fort located at the mouth of the Condado Lagoon , across from the historic sector of Miramar in San Juan , Puerto Rico .\\n\nIt was built during the 18th century to replace a smaller battery (called El Boquerón) that stood at the easternmost end of the San Juan islet. The original Boquerón battery was used by the Spanish to defend the city of San Juan from attacks by Sir Francis Drake in 1595 and George Clifford, the third Earl of Cumberland in 1598, who managed to destroy it during his attack. San Gerónimo became part of San Juan\\'s first line of defense, along with the Fortín San Antonio and Escambrón Fort, while the last line of defense was the formidable Castillo San Cristóbal , which guarded the city entrance proper and also defended from land attacks.\\n\nHistory\nThe San Gerónimo and San Antonio forts were pivotal in repelling the invasion by the forces of British Admiral Henry Harvey and Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1797. On April 17, 1797, their combined forces (64 to 68 ships and 7,000 to 13,000 men) landed in Cangrejos, approximately three miles west of San Juan. San Juan\\'s military forces, which included, among others, the Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico (Resident Regiment of Puerto Rico) and the Militias Disciplinadas  (Trained Militias) were outnumbered by the invaders by a ratio of almost three to one.  Admiral Harvey blockaded the San Juan Harbor while Abercromby established his operations headquarters in San Mateo parish overseeing all of San Juan and the Martín Peña Bridge. Abercromby\\'s strategy was to take the Martín Peña bridge in order to block Spanish reinforcements from the south and bombard San Gerónimo and San Antonio from Miramar to gain access to and cross the San Antonio Bridge into the San Juan islet. British forces included the Royal Marines, made famous by their later defeat of Napoleon\\'s troops in Egypt. Then-Governor of Puerto Rico Field Marshal Don Ramón de Castro y Gutiérrez, a brilliant strategist, prevented the British from advancing and frustrated their conquest of San Juan.\\n\nThe San Gerónimo and San Antonio sustained heavy damage from the constant bombardment during the two-week siege on the city. Chronicles describe the defenders shooting their muskets and cannons from behind sandbags because of the devastation their forts sustained. Both San Gerónimo and San Antonio were eventually rebuilt and expanded.\\n\nSan Gerónimo is located adjacent to the grounds of the Caribe Hilton Hotel .  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 11, 1983.  Unlike similar forts near Old San Juan , it is not part of San Juan National Historic Site . San Gerónimo is owned by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture but is managed by the Hilton. [ citation needed ] Thanks to the work of volunteers, the fort is again open to the public and contains an exhibit of the history of San Juan. The \"Polvorín de San Gerónimo\", or gunpowder house, that was built in 1769 and supplied the fort with gunpowder, is now part of the Luis Muñoz Rivera Park nearby.\\n\nAs recent as the year 2006, attempts were being made by the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build a breakwater to stop any further deterioration from irreparably damaging the centuries-old fort.  Senate Vice President Orlando Parga has led efforts to modify some of the construction projects that would encroach on the fort or would hamper the Corps of Engineers\\' preservation and reconstruction efforts. [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn July 2007, the Fort was the scene of protests against the construction of a tourist project called Paseo Caribe that would block access to the fortification. Protesters argued that the public should have free access to it. The protest lasted about a week during which the protesters halted the construction projects by climbing onto the cranes. [ citation needed ] \\n\nThe Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 directed the U.S. Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to determine the suitability of including San Gerónimo as part of San Juan National Historic Site.  \\n\nAfter two decades closed to the public, in 2018 the Asociación Amigos del Fortín de San Jerónimo was created, a non-profit association that is responsible for the preservation and future reopening for the charity of the Puerto Rican people and tourists.\\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would make the Fort an affiliated area of the National Park Service .  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nFortín San Antonio\nFortín de San Antonio was a fortification built by the Spanish in San Juan, Puerto Rico with the aim of fortifying the San Antonio Bridge. The bridge was of great strategic importance, given that it was the only land accessible entrance to the islet of San Juan. It was located southeast of Fortín de San Gerónimo .  \\n\nHistory\nConstruction began in 1568 of the bridge which would link the islet of San Juan with the island of Puerto Rico . The bridge at this time was made of wood with a door with a permanent garrison.\\n\nIn 1595, 26 ships led by the privateer Sir Francis Drake attempted to land his forces near the coast of Escambron. Coastal defenses in Boqueron and the cannon batteries of San Antonio bridge repelled his landing attempt, forcing Drake's armada to withdraw and attempt to enter San Juan Bay . The bay defenses ultimately thwarted his attack.\\n\nIn 1598, George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland , attacked the islet of San Juan. The English forces managed land at El Boquerón, and overwhelmed the Spanish defensive forces which had been debilitated by a recent dysentery outbreak. The English managed to lay siege to the city which subsequently surrendered. However, a disease outbreak which killed around 400 English troops forced the English to withdraw on 28 August.\\n\nIn 1776, the fortified bridge of San Antonio was replaced by a new reinforced structure designed by Thomas O\\'Daly. The structure is later remodeled in 1783 by Juan Francisco Mestre. Further strengthening of the bridgehead was done by Ignacio Mascaro and Homar in 1796.\\n\nBoth the fort of San Jeronimo as the fortified facilities San Antonio Bridge were instrumental in repelling the English attack of 1797 in which the English army, led by Sir Ralph Abercromby, sought to besiege the island of San Juan. The batteries of Fort San Antonio were heavily damaged by the impact of English cannon fire.\\n\nSee Battle of San Juan (1797) .\\n\nThe reconstruction and renovation of Fort San Antonio was completed in 1800 in which a battery of two cannons was added. In peacetime, the fort was used as a tax control point for cattle ranchers .\\n\nBy 1822 the bridge was in great disrepair as well as the entire area including the fort of San Jeronimo and El Morro. Repairs were made under the leadership of Miguel de la Torre , who was serving as governor.  \\nIn 1894, Governor Antonio Dabán ordered the demolition of the entire complex to build a new metal bridge into the islet of San Juan.  The only remnants of Fort San Antonio which survive today is a small portion of a rampart which is visible between the new Guillermo Esteves bridge and Dos Hermanos Bridge .\\n\nReferences\n18°27\\xe2\\x80\\xb235\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°05\\xe2\\x80\\xb210\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.459857°N 66.086187°W ﻿ / 18.459857; -66.086187 \\n"

The square coastal fort has massive sandstone walls that date back to the 1630s. Although the U.S. Navy bombarded the fort in 1898, the fort survived. Today the fort is part of the San Juan National Historic Site , which is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and on both the National Register of Historic Places and the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones .  The fort is not open to visitors, but it can be viewed from its exterior.\\n\nHistory\nThe original fort built on this site in the late 1500s was made of wood; it burned to the ground in 1625 during a Dutch attack . However, the Spaniards replaced it with a stone fort between 1630 and 1660.\\n\nEl Cañuelo was the smallest fort in the harbor defense system. Cannon fire from the fort and from Castillo San Felipe del Morro created a crossfire to protect the entrance to San Juan bay. The fort also guarded the mouth of the Bayamón River on the other side. reportedly, at one time, there was a huge chain crossing from El Morro to El Cañuelo that was extended during attacks to provide a physical barricade across the bay entrance.  \\n\nOn 12 May 1898, during the Spanish-American War , the United States Navy bombarded El Cañuelo as part of its bombardment of San Juan . Spanish records do not list any guns or troops at El Cañuelo at the time. [ citation needed ] \\n\nOther information\nThe square fort is about 80 feet (24 m) per side, with one guerite ( garita in Spanish). It covers an estimated  3.4-acre (14,000 m 2 ) area. El Cañuelo Island was originally a rocky islet completely surrounded by water and accessible only by boat. A some point after 1986 nearby Isla de Cabras was artificially expanded to incorporate it.\\n\nA causeway connects Isla de Cabras to the main island;  the road is Puerto Rico Highway 870, and it passes by the fort as it reaches the island. The site features fabulous views of Boca Vieja Cove to the west and San Juan Bay to the east. The fort itself is closed to the public, but one can walk around its walls. There is a small recreation area with picnic tables at the site of the fort.\\n\nSee also\nCitations\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nFrancisco Oller\nFrancisco Manuel Oller y Cestero (June 17, 1833 – May 17, 1917) was a Puerto Rican painter, the only Latin American painter to have played a role in the development of Impressionism . One of the most distinguished transatlantic painters of his day, Oller helped transform painting in the Caribbean .  \\n\nBiography\nFrancisco Manuel Oller y Cestero was born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico , the third of four children of aristocratic and wealthy Spanish parents Cayetano Juan Oller y Fromesta and María del Carmen Cestero Dávila.   When he was eleven he began to study art under the tutelage of Juan Cleto Noa, a painter who had an art academy in San Juan, Puerto Rico . There, Oller demonstrated that he had an enormous talent in art and in 1848, when Oller was fifteen years old, General Juan Prim , Governor of Puerto Rico , offered Oller the opportunity to continue his studies in Rome . However, the offer was not accepted as Oller\\'s mother felt that he was too young to travel abroad alone.\\n\nWhen Oller was eighteen, he moved to Madrid , Spain , where he studied painting at the Royal Academy of San Fernando , under the tutelage of Don Federico de Madrazo y Kuntz , director of the Prado Museum . In 1858, he moved to Paris , France where he studied under Thomas Couture . Later he enrolled to study art in the Louvre under the instruction of Gustave Courbet .  During his free time, Oller, who had a baritone type of singing voice, worked and participated in local Italian operas . He frequently visited cafés where he met with fellow artists. He also became a friend of fellow Puerto Ricans Ramón Emeterio Betances y Alacán and Salvador Carbonell del Toro, who were expatriates in France because of their political beliefs. In 1859, Oller exhibited some of his artistic works next to those of Bazille , Renoir , Monet , and Sisley .  \\n\nFor a short time, Paul Cézanne was one of Oller\\'s students, although their professional relationship deteriorated with time. By 1865, Oller was the first Puerto Rican and Hispanic Impressionist artist. In 1868, he founded The Free Academy of Art of Puerto Rico.\\n\n\\nOller's paintings were a big contribution of history during this time.  His paintings showed conflicts and daily lives of people outside of his home country as well as subjects internally.  The author Edward J. Sullivan describes in his book, From San Juan to Paris and Back: Francisco Oller and Caribbean Art in the Era of Impressionism :\nIn the normal course of his day, the artist would have observed objects of quotidian use to the slaves and free persons of color with whom he regularly interacted. His world was not only the cultivated, Europeanized milieus of the Puerto Rican bourgeoisie, but also the realities of the relatively small city of San Juan, where he was born and where most of his career developed. Even during his many years of residence in Madrid and Paris, he would have carried with him the cultural baggage of his place of origin. His familiarity with the different strata of society on the Caribbean island of his birth was a constant reality as he intermingled with Realist and Impressionist artists and others who constituted his world on the other side of the Atlantic. This aspect of his personality cannot be easily separated from the other. Oller was a person of multiple cultural affinities, which allowed him to embrace what he saw abroad, but also to interiorize and reformulate those elements for purposes that conformed to his vision of tropical reality. \nUpon his return to Puerto Rico from France in 1866 he found himself face-to-face with slavery and he would create a number of works including El negro flageado (The negro being flogged), El castigo del negro enamorado (the punishment of the negro in love), and others depicting slavery in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nOller spent nearly two decades in Europe working alongside the pioneers of Impressionism, and, through his travels, participated in a vibrant exchange of aesthetic ideas, forging his own brand of international modernism while engaging social issues unique to the Caribbean.  During his three trips to Paris, Oller affiliated himself with Paul Cézanne, fellow Caribbean artist Camille Pissarro (born in St. Thomas ), and other members of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist movements.  \\n\nThroughout his later life and after his death, Oller was compared to Jose Campeche as one of the most outstanding figures of the arts in his country. Campeche created an impressive body of portraits and religious subjects.  \\n\nIn 1884, he founded an art school for young women  which was later to be known as the Universidad Nacional. In 1871, Spain honored Oller by naming him a member of the Caballeros de la Orden de Carlos III (which translates to Knighthood of the Order of Carlos III ), and a year later he became the official painter of the Royal Court of Amadeo I . Oller developed an interest in bringing out the reality of Puerto Rico\\'s landscape, its people, and culture through his works of art. Oller\\'s paintings can be found in museums worldwide, including the Musée d\\'Orsay in France.\\n\nOller died on May 17, 1917, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was buried at the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan, Puerto Rico .\\n\nStyles and influences\n\\nOller was a prolific painter with works ranging in topic from still-lifes and landscapes to historical events and portraiture.  While he was involved with several painting movements, Realism , Naturalism and Impressionism ; he is best known for his Impressionist works.  Oller's style of painting made him stand out among the many artists that took part in the depiction of Puerto Rico's lush tropical landscapes of both rural and urban landscapes and provided a realistic image of Puerto Rico compared to the European artists that flocked over to the Caribbean to paint lush, idealized landscapes of the environment.  Oller's main subject matter of focus was everything within Puerto Rico, whether it was still life paintings of plantains and bananas or historical battle scenes. Oller\\'s painting style provided a historical context for his painting, providing a cultural view through his own lens. Oller was involved with many art movements from the realist art movement, the naturalist art movement, and the impressionist art movement of which he is best known for.  In his life, Oller spent nearly two decades in Europe working alongside the pioneers of these art movements, drawing influence from them in the evolution of his artwork. One characteristic that is quite apparent in his work that he drew influence from another artist is his sober, unidealized depictions of rural workers in Puerto Rico.\nThe \"plantation portraits\" by Oller, as well as those by Mendes Belisario in Jamaica and dozens of others throughout the Caribbean and the southern United States (where the plantations mostly served the cotton industry), were part of a long tradition of depictions of agriculture and servitude. Rarely, if ever, depicting the negative associations of enslaved or indentured labor, they attempted to create nostalgic views of the \"old homestead,\" or a faraway venue of nostalgia. While Oller's plantation pictures were executed in a somewhat different spirit, they nonetheless pertain to this genre that played a significant role throughout the development of visualization in a Caribbean context over a period of some 150 years. \nOller was influenced by Barbizon school painter Jean-Fran\\xc3 7ois Millet to paint in this way, allowing him to provide a realistic depiction of the life of Puerto Ricans in their historical context. In his early years, Francisco Oller was taught by European painters at the Academia, including French neoclassical painter Jean Baptiste Vermay . His main source of influence in his early years comes from two painters, the Spaniard Luis Paret y Alcázar and, most significantly, the Puerto Rican José Campeche y Jordán . The artwork of José Campeche provided Oller a major point of reference for him in his young years as a developing artist. Francisco Oller was compared to Campeche as one of the most prominent artists in his country's history. Oller not only drew inspiration from the work of Campeche but copied works of art by him and even lived in the artist's former house.  \\n\nSelected works\nThe Battle of Treviño denotes a significant moment for Oller within the world of Spanish art. The painting represents an official theme of recent national history, through which the artist places himself in the tradition of military images that was of great importance in later nineteenth-century Iberian painting. The genre of battle painting is one of the least avant-garde artistic forms. Oller, an artist often associated with the \"new\" in art, is here going against that grain and inserting himself directly within a mode most often practiced by artists of a decidedly conservative personality. Nevertheless, he used this form as a way to experiment with the possibilities of a spontaneity and pictorial freedom within the framework of traditional subject matter. \nLegacy and remembrance\nOller was responsible for bringing Realism and Impressionism to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Combining them with the artistic traditions of San Juan, he revolutionized the school of painting in Puerto Rico and throughout the Caribbean region.  Oller also helped bring outside world events by drawing them and displaying them publicly.  Many Puerto Rican artists have followed in Oller\\'s footsteps, including Ramón Fradé (1875-1954) and Miguel Pou (1880-1968).  \\n\nThe town of Cataño in Puerto Rico, named a high school after him and the City of New York renamed P.S.61 in The Bronx P.S. Francisco Oller.  There is also a Francisco Oller Library in the Escuela de Artes Plásticas (School of Plastic Arts) in San Juan.  The Francisco Oller Museum where many artists, such as Tomás Batista , exhibit their work is located in the city of Bayamón . In Buffalo, New York there is a Francisco Oller and Diego Rivera Museum of Art where Manuel Rivera-Ortiz and other artists have exhibited their work.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nGeneral store\nA general merchant store (also known as general merchandise store , general dealer , village shop , or country store ) is a rural or small-town store that carries a general line of merchandise .  It carries a broad selection of merchandise, sometimes in a small space, where people from the town and surrounding rural areas come to purchase all their general goods. The store carries routine stock and obtains special orders from warehouses . It differs from a convenience store or corner shop in that it will be the main shop for the community rather than a convenient supplement.\\n\nGeneral stores often sell staple food items such as milk and bread, and various household goods such as hardware and electrical supplies. The concept of the general store is very old, and although some still exist, there are far fewer than there once were, due to urbanization , urban sprawl , and the relatively recent phenomenon of big-box stores . The term \"general merchandise store\" is also used to describe a hybrid of a department store , with a wide selection of goods, and a discount store , with low prices. Examples include J. C. Penney and Sears .  \\n\nHistory\nGeneral dealers were established in the 18th and 19th centuries in many remote populated places where mobility was limited and a single shop was sufficient to service the entire community. Due to its close connection and confinement to its customers, general dealers often adjusted their sales offerings to the specific preferences of their community.  \\n\nGeneral dealers existed, apart from mainland Europe and Asia , in all European colonies and generally in areas where colonists encroached upon communities that previously did not trade with money.  In the colonies, trading or bartering in local produce had existed long before official shops were opened. The growing need for imported goods, both from European settlers and native populations, led to the establishment of a network of merchants , and subsequently to the creation of a money economy.  \\n\nBy country\nWhile a large number of general stores still exist in Australia, as in other parts of the world their numbers were greatly reduced by the advent of supermarkets.\\n\nThe oldest continually run general store in Canada is Trousdale\\'s, located in Sydenham, Ontario , which has been operated by the Trousdale family since 1836. Sociability has always been a feature, as locals come to chat as well as buy.  Gray Creek Store in Gray Creek, Kootenay Bay , Canada is the largest and oldest general dealer in the Kootenay Lake region  Enniskillen General Store in Clarington, Ontario has been in operation since 1840 and still continues today. Robinson\\'s General Store in Dorset, Ontario, voted \"Canada\\'s Best Country Store\", has been owned and operated by the same family since 1921.\\n\nIn the Dominican Republic , a colmado is the country\\'s equivalent of a general store. Colmado literal translation is \\'full to the brim\\'  implying its great density of goods in a small space. The colmado is much more than just a general store, for it offers a social gathering point for the residents of the town or neighborhood. The colmado is an important institution in the Dominican Republic serving as an economic, social and political center for every small community. It is common for colmados to have loud Dominican music such as merengue, bachata, or salsa playing.  A common pastime for Dominican men is to play dominoes and drink a beer at their local colmado on Sundays. Another particularity of the colmado is that they provide delivery service of their products directly to the customer\\'s dwelling. Products range from beer, snacks, toilet paper to flashlights and canned food.\\n\nThe Greek merchants in Egypt were called bakal .  \\n\nGeneral stores ( sekatavarakauppa ) first appeared in Finland in 1859 when fixed shop retailers were allowed to set up shops in rural towns for the first time. Prior to that, authorised trade in rural products other than those produced in the same region depended on city travel, open-air markets and fairs.  A related type of store is the village store ( kyl\\xc3 4kauppa ), typically located in sparsely populated towns, which still performs many similar functions to general stores. As in many other countries, their numbers were greatly reduced with the advent of supermarkets, from over 3400 such shops in 1980 to 241 in 2017.  \\n\nIn India, a tapri is a regional version of a general store. It stores all home, personal, medical, and hygienic daily-use products. Many Kirana shops sell products other than food, such as clothing or household items, stationery, toys, tools, and medicines. Small Kirana stores, which are generally located on the corner of streets and generally known as katta or tapri, sell cigarettes, tobacco, and tea.  \\n\nRecently, there has been a notable integration of Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) services in Kirana or general stores across India. AePS allows customers to conduct basic banking transactions such as cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, and fund transfer using their Aadhaar number and biometric authentication. This integration has enabled Kirana stores to serve as financial service points, offering convenient banking services to local communities. \\n\nOn 30 July 2024, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) introduced an interoperable QR code to link neighborhood store owners with consumers. With ONDC-registered buyer apps like Magicpin and Paytm , merchants can create a unique QR code that customers can scan to access their online store on the ONDC platform.  \\n\nDue to its sparse population, there are still a number of general dealers in Namibia , for instance, the Solitaire General Dealer in Solitaire , an important stopover for tourists through Namibia\\'s Namib-Naukluft Park .  \\n\nIn Puerto Rico, a US territory , several general stores (\"colmado\") have proliferated since the 1970s.\\n\nThere are still many general dealers in South Africa ; the oldest is Oom Samie se Winkel ( Afrikaans : Uncle Sammie\\'s Shop ) in Dorp Street, Stellenbosch .  Oepverkoop is the oldest general dealer in Paternoster, Western Cape .  Goodwood Museum in Cape Town displays the operation of a general dealer shop.  \\n\nVillage shops are becoming less common in the densely populated parts of the country, although they remain common in remote rural areas.\\n\nTheir rarity in England is due to several factors, such as the rise in car ownership, competition from large chain supermarkets , the rising cost of village properties, and the increasing trend of the wealthy to own holiday homes in picturesque villages, consequently these houses which used to be occupied full-time by potential customers are often vacant for long periods.\\n\nOf those villages in England who still have shops, these days they are often a combination of services under one roof to increase the likelihood of profit and survival. Extra services may include a post office , private business services such as tearooms , cafes , and bed and breakfast accommodation; or state services such as libraries and General Practitioner (GP) or Dental clinics; and charity partners such as Women\\'s Institute (WI) coffee mornings held on the day most elderly villagers might collect their weekly pensions.\\n\nCommunity shops have become popular in some villages, often jointly owned and run by many villagers as a co-operative . The Village Retail Services Association promotes the role and function of the village shop in the UK.  Many modern village shops choose to stock items which draw in customers from neighbouring areas who are seeking locally sourced , organic and specialist produce such as local cuts of meat, local cheeses, wines etc.\\n\nCorner shops are usually so-called because they are located on the corner plot or street end of a row of terraced housing , often Victorian or Edwardian factory workers\\' houses. The doorway into the shop was usually on the corner of the plot to maximise shop floor space within, this also offered two display windows onto two opposing streets. Many have now altered the original shop front layout in favour of a mini-supermarket style. Although it is common that corner shops found in the UK were former grocers\\' shops, other specialist retailers also occupied such plots and have suffered the same fate of being largely replaced by supermarkets and hypermarkets, such retailers as greengrocers , bakers , butchers and fishmongers .\\n\nMany British television and radio series, especially soap operas , feature corner shops or village shops as cornerstones for community gatherings and happenings. A prominent example is the village shop in Ambridge , the fictional village in the BBC Radio 4 series, The Archers , (1950-present). The ITV1 soap opera Coronation Street (1960-present) has featured a corner shop since the first episode; originally owned by Florrie Lindley , it was later acquired by Alf Roberts the grocer, and after his death in the late-1990s was bought by Dev Alahan , reflecting this common change in British culture to Asian shopkeepers. The dying days and changing culture of the traditional British grocer were explored to great effect in the BBC TV comedy series Open All Hours (1976-1985), set in the real suburb of Balby in Doncaster ; the shop front used for the street scenes in the series does actually exist in the area and is now a hairdressing salon. The BBC Scotland comedy series Still Game has a corner shop as a recurring location where characters can meet and gossip; the actor who plays its owner, Navid Harrid ( Sanjeev Kohli ), plays a similar role as Bangaram in the Radio 4 comedy series Fags, Mags and Bags which is set entirely in Ramesh\\'s shop.\\n\nThe band Cornershop in part base their image on the perception that many convenience shops are now owned by British Asian people. In terms of British popular culture, these media representations give some idea of the importance attached to local shops in the national psyche and as a mainstay of community life.\\n\nGeneral stores and itinerant peddlers dominated in rural America until the coming of the automobile after 1910.  Farmers and ranchers depended on general stores that had a limited stock and slow turnover; they made enough profit to stay in operation by selling at high prices. Often farmers would barter butter, cheese, eggs, vegetables or other foods which the merchant would resell. Prices were not marked on each item; instead the customer negotiated a price. Men did most of the shopping, since the main criterion was credit rather than quality of goods. Indeed, most customers shopped on credit, paying later when crops or cattle were sold; the owner\\'s ability to judge credit worthiness was vital to his success. The store was often a gathering point for local men to chat, pass around the weekly newspaper, and talk politics.   [ page needed ] \\n\nIn the South, the general store was especially important after the Civil War, as the merchant was one of the few sources of credit available until the cash crops (usually cotton or tobacco) came in.  [ page needed ] There were few towns and very few cities, so rural general stores and itinerant peddlers were the main sources of supply.    \\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, general stores were displaced in many areas of the United States by many different types of specialized retailers in trading towns and small cities. However, from the 1960s to the present, many small specialized retailers have in turn been crushed by the so-called \" category killers \", which are \"big-box\" wholesale -type retailers large enough to carry the majority of best-selling goods in a specific category, like sporting goods or office supplies. Gray\\'s General Store of Adamsville, Rhode Island is reputed to be the oldest continually operating general store in the United States until its temporary closure in 2012.  It subsequently reopened in the summer of 2013.  \\n\nHowever, the convenience inherent in the general store has been revived in the form of the modern convenience store . A few variety stores draw upon the concept of having a broad variety of goods servicing small communities where big-box retailers are absent; Dollar General stores, in particular, draws its name from both the \"dollar store\" concept of having items at a fixed price point and the general store.\\n\nThis is a select list of historical general stores in the United States, listed in alphabetical order.\\n\nSee also\nFootnotes\nFurther reading"

        "page_content": "Contents\nGuajataca Lake\nGuajataca Lake , or Lago Guajataca , is a reservoir of the Guajataca River created by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority in 1929. It is located between the municipalities of San Sebastián , Quebradillas , and Isabela in Puerto Rico ,   and receives most of its water from the Rio Guajataca and Rio Chiquito de Cibao rivers. The lake primarily functions as a water reservoir as well as for recreational activities such as boating and fishing.   Various species of fish such as peacock bass , largemouth bass , sunfish , perch , catfish , tilapia and threadfin shad can be found in the lake.  The Guajataka Scout Reservation partially borders the southern portion of the lake. The dam at Guajataca Lake experienced a structural failure on September 22, 2017, due to the hit from Hurricane Maria .    \\n\nThe reservoir is considered a touristic area.  \\n\nGuajataca Dam\nThe Guajataca Dam is an earthen dam  is currently used for irrigation and potable water purposes. A hydroelectric power station was built, but not longer in use.  The reservoir has a normal surface area of 1.321 square miles (3.42 square kilometres),   its length is 2.5 miles (4.0 kilometres), its maximum width is 1 mile (1.6 kilometres),  the mean depth is 12 m and the maximum depth is 27 m, located near the dam.  its maximum discharge is 28,954 cubic feet (819.9 cubic metres) per second. Its normal storage capacity is 34,050 acre-feet (42,000,000 cubic metres ), and its drainage basin is 24.58 square miles (63.7 km 2 ).   \\n\nThe construction of the dam was authorized by act 63 of the Legislature of Puerto Rico , known as the \"Isabela public irrigation law,\" approved April 19, 1919.  \\n\nThe dam was constructed starting in 1928. The reservoir had an initial storage capacity of 39,286 acre-feet (48 million cubic metres), but by 1999 (71 years later), the capacity had been reduced to 34,276 acre-feet (42 million cubic metres), as about 13% less, attributed to sediment erosion.  \\nThe surface area of the reservoir was 3.42 km 2 (1.32 sq mi) in 1999.  \\n\nAccording to the National Inventory of Dams , Guajataca Dam was designed by and is owned by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.  \\n\nOn September 22, 2017, at 18:10 GMT, following Hurricane Maria , operators at Guajataca Dam announced that the dam\\'s spillway was failing at the northern end of the lake and it could result in the whole dam collapsing.  The National Weather Service a few minutes later urged all 70,000 residents in the flood area to be evacuated. The National Weather Service stated the dam was a \"life-threatening situation\".    \"It's a structural failure. I don't have any more details,\" Governor Ricardo Rosselló stated. \"We're trying to evacuate as many people as possible.\"  Rosselló ordered the Puerto Rico National Guard and the Police to help assist in the evacuation effort downstream.  The dam lies across the Guajataca River to form a reservoir that can hold roughly 11 billion gallons of water.  \\n\nAs of September 2017 [update] , the dam was last inspected on October 23, 2013.  \\n\nThe first phase of repairs to avoid the threat of flooding were completed on November 17, 2017. Since then about 10,000 residents, including farmers, who depend on the waters of the reservoir, have been struggling with the rationing of water. There is confusion and little transparency as to how the issue is being handled. Final repairs will be ongoing, until 2028.   \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nGuajataca State Forest\nGuajataca State Forest  is one of the 20 forests that make up the public forest system of Puerto Rico . The Guajataca Forest is located in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico, along the Northern Karst zone in the municipality of Isabela and municipality of Quebradillas, and is near Camuy and San Sebastián . The forest is renowned for its ecological diversity, the mogotes and karstic formations, and its numerous caves and canyons. It also has the largest trail system of any Puerto Rican state forest.  \\n\nGeography\nGuajataca State Forest is located in the middle of the karst landscape country, particularly the Northern Karst zone of Puerto Rico. A karst is a topographical zone formed by the dissolution of soluble porous rocks, in this case limestone , with features such as mogotes , canyons, caves , sinkholes, streams and rivers, all of which are common on this region of the island.  \\n\nThe forest has an average annual precipitation of 75 inches of rain a year. The average temperature is 76.5\\xc2\\xba F and the highest temperatures are usually reported during the months of July and August.  \\n\nThe soil of the forest is formed by limestone outcrops typical of tropical karst zones characterized by mogotes separated by geological sinks. The Forest of Guajataca lies in the girdle tertiary limestone of northwestern Puerto Rico. The Aymamón and Aguada limestone zones are found within the forest. The Aymamón limestone is characterized by sub-conical hills called mogotes while the Aguada limestone is characterized by its caves .  \\n\nHistory\nThe forest preserve dates to 1943 when the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration set the area aside for the purpose of preserving the flora and fauna of the karstic region. The forest was included in the 1975 proclamation of Law 133 which adds further protection to the forests in the state forest system. The forest is now managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA).  \\n\nEcology\nThe vegetation of the forest is split into two zones: the montane vegetation found in the mogotes and steepest parts of the forest (76% of the forest area) and the lowland vegetation found along the valleys and flatter areas (24% of the forest area).  \\n\nThere are more than 186 tree species found in the forest, out of which 156 are native, 7 are introduced and 40 are endemic to Puerto Rico. Some of the endemic tree species are the ceboruquillo ( Thouinia striata ) and the so called macho cedar ( Hieronyma clusioides ). Other common species of forest are the bullet tree ( Terminalia buceras ), the Spanish elm ( Cordia alliodora ) and the white indigo berry ( Randia aculeata ).  \\n\nDue to the large number of caves found in the karstic areas, the forest is home to numerous bat species, most notably the Jamaican fruit bat ( Artibeus jamaicensis ) which is very common in the region. The endangered Puerto Rican boa ( Epicrates inornatus ) is also found in the forest. There are more than 70 bird species, out of which 26 are native, 26 are migratory and 12 are endemic to the island. Some of the most common endemic species are the Puerto Rican woodpecker ( Melanerpes portoricencis ), the Puerto Rican tody ( Todus mexicanus ), the Puerto Rican screech owl ( Otus nudipes ), the Puerto Rican vireo ( Vireo latimeri ), the Puerto Rican flycatcher ( Myiarchus antillarum ), the Puerto Rican bullfinch ( Loxigilla portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican spindalis ( Spindalis portoricensis ) and Adelaide\\'s warbler ( Setophaga adelaidae ).  \\n\nCueva del Viento\nThe Cueva del Viento or Cave of the Wind is a cave found within the forest that is often considered the highlight of the reserve for visitors. The entrance to the cave is down 40 steps and strong flashlights are required to visit as the cave has no lighting installed due to the presence of cavern wildlife. The cave is often muddy and slippery due to the frequent rain and waters that flows through the karstic zone and even if there are hand railings through the cave visitors must be cautious about where they walk. Although the entrance area of the cave has been broken-off by past visitors it still contains numerous interesting geological formations including stalagmites and stalactites .  The caverns are home to numerous bat species and bat colonies so visitors must be cautious not to disturb them while visiting the cave.  \\n\nRecreation\nThe forest is located about 2 hours from San Juan and about 1 hour from Rincón . It can be accessed through PR-446 highway in Isabela . In addition to Cueva de Viento the forest has the infrastructure for camping, picnics and more than 44 km of hiking trails.  Camping in the forest is $4 a night for adults and $2 a night for children, and camping spaces must be reserved in advance through the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources .  There is no admission fee for visiting or hiking in the forest.  \\n\nGuajataca Forest contains the largest trail system of any forest in Puerto Rico, including El Yunque National Forest. Most of the trails begin by the ranger station, which also hosts an information center although it is not always open and it is recommended to call the rangers\\' office beforehand. The most popular hike is the 1.5-mile Interpretative Trail  which leads to an observation tower that offer some of the best views of the karstic countryside.  Trail #1 starts off the Interpretative Trail  and leads to the Cueva de Viento, the park\\'s most popular feature.  \\n\nGuajataca Lake is a reservoir of the Guajataca River located in close proximity to the forest. The lake is located in the boundary between the municipalities of Isabela , Quebradillas and San Sebastián . The camping areas and fishing facilities found by the lake are often confused with the Guajataca State Forest or incorrectly associated with it even if they are outside of the forest boundaries. The lake area is nonetheless a very popular camping, kayaking and fishing spot in the region and some of its facilities are also managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. \nSee also\nReferences"

They were joined by a steel viaduct 250 feet (76.2 m) long at an elevation of 131 feet (40 m) above the river level.   \\n\nThe tunnel is open to the public but it is fairly isolated.  The tunnel leads to \"Guajataca beach\" known for its white sand, raging surf, and dangerous turbulent waters.  \\n\nConcerts are sometimes held at the Guajataca Tunnel.  \\nIn 2019, virtual tours of Guajataca Tunnel, were organized by Discover Puerto Rico, the marketing arm of the Puerto Rico Department of Tourism.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°29\\xe2\\x80\\xb224\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°57\\xe2\\x80\\xb235\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.4900°N 66.9598°W ﻿ / 18.4900; -66.9598 \\n\n\\n\nThis article about a Puerto Rican building or structure related topic is a stub .

While Monte Guilarte is located in the municipality of Adjuntas , the forest\\'s borders also include parts of Guayanilla , Peñuelas and Yauco .  \\n\nHistory\nIn 1935, the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration  acquired 3,500 acres in and around Monte Guilarte in the municipality of Adjuntas with the goal of preserving the area as a forest reserve. The reserve was intended to be a wildlife preserve for the conservation of numerous plant and animal species found in the area but also for recreational purposes. Today the forest is managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA), which has enlarged the protected area of the forest which now extends 4,822 acres.  \\n\nEcology\nThe forest has altitudes varying from 2,500 to 3,950 feet above sea level and it is divided into two forest zones: the subtropical moist broadleaf forest in the form of the Sierra palm tree forest and the montane rain forest found in the highest peaks of the forest. These preserved forests are very important for the protection of various hydrological basins such as those of the Arecibo River , the Añasco River and the Guayanilla River , all of which have their sources within the forest\\'s boundaries.  \\n\nThe forest is home to approximately 227 species of trees of which 4 are endangered or threatened: the West Indian walnut ( Juglans jamaicensis ), the palo de Ramón tree ( Banara vanderbiltii ), the endemic dwarf tree fern ( Alsophila dryopteroides ) and the Monte Guilarte hollyfern ( Polystichum calderonense ). The latter is also endemic, highly endangered and can only be found in two locations in this forest.  \\n\nThe most common type of forest zone found in the reserve is the Sierra palm tree forest where the species of the same name is most numerous. In addition to this palm tree the forest is also home to other indicator species such as the caimitillo tree ( Micropholis sp. ) and the tabaiba tree ( Sapium laurocerasum ). Another notable tree species is the Puerto Rican magnolia or jagüilla ( Magnolia portoricensis ).  \\n\nThe montane forest, also referred to as the cloud forest , located in the highest parts of the forest is home to species such as the Tabebuia shumanniana and the Ocotea spatulata which are evergreen trees with small leaves often found in the highest parts of Puerto Rico. Other trees found in this area include the Spanish elm or capá prieto ( Cordia alliodora ) and the introduced yet naturalized swamp mahogany or swamp eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus robusta ), which are adapted to the cooler temperatures.  \\n\nThe Guilarte Forest is one of the few protected areas in Puerto Rico that are home to numerous endangered or threatened animal species such as the red fruit bat ( Stenoderma rufum ), only found in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands , Eneida\\'s coquí ( Eleutherodactylus eneidae ), the mountain coquí ( Eleutherodactylus portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican boa ( Epicrates inornatus ), the Puerto Rican vireo or bien-te-veo ( Vireo latimeri ), and the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk or Sierra hawk ( Accipiter striatus venator ), a highly endangered subspecies of the sharp-shinned hawk .  \\n\nOther animal species found in the forest are the scaly-naped pigeon ( Patagioenas squamosa ), the Puerto Rican emerald hummingbird ( Riccordia maugeaus ), the Puerto Rican tody or San Pedrito ( Todus mexicanus ), the Puerto Rican woodpecker ( Melanerpes portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican twig anole ( Anolis occultus ), the olive bush anole ( Anolis krugi ), the yellow-bearded anole ( Anolis gundlachi ), the emerald anole ( Anolis evermanni ), the Puerto Rican giant anole ( Anolis cuvieri ), and the Puerto Rican galliwasp or four-legged snake ( Diploglossus pleii ).  \\n\nRecreation\nThe forest reserve is open during daylight hours and offers opportunities for hiking, birdwatching and cabins. There are two main hiking trails in the forest: the San Andrés Trail which circumnavigates the forest and the Pico Guilarte trail  which leads to the summit of Monte Guilarte , the highest point of the forest. Both trails offer views through a series of lookout points. Other facilities in the forest include bathrooms, barbecue pits and cabins for visitors. There are seven cabins (with room for 4 guests) available, and reservations must be made in advanced by contacting the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources .  Parking is available at the DRNA ranger office in Guilarte, Adjuntas at the corner of PR-518 and PR-131 roads.  \\n\nCamping is not allowed within the forest but the area outside the reserve also offers additional opportunities for recreation such as Garzas Lake which is used for fishing and camping, and numerous waterfalls and pools for swimming such as Charco Mangó and Charco El Ataúd .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\n\\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nGuánica State Forest\nThe Guánica State Forest , popularly known as the Guánica Dry Forest  is a subtropical dry forest located in southwest Puerto Rico . The area was designated as a forest reserve in 1919 and a United Nations Biosphere Reserve in 1981.  It is considered the best preserved subtropical dry forest and the best example of dry forest in the Caribbean .  \\n\nWith approximately 10,000 acres, it is the largest of the 20 state forests of Puerto Rico , and it extends over 5 municipalities: Guánica , Guayanilla , Peñuelas , Ponce , and Yauco (although the forest units located in the municipalities of Peñuelas and Ponce only consist of keys and small islands).  \\n\nHistory\nThe dry forest area of southwestern Puerto Rico protected under the jurisdiction of the Guánica Dry Forest was first established in 1919 as a forest reserve. The United Nations recognized the ecological value of the forest in 1981 when it was designated a Biosphere Reserve , the second in Puerto Rico after El Yunque National Forest (then called the Caribbean National Forest). The forest was given further protections as a nature reserve on October 16, 1985, by the Puerto Rico Planning Board , and all provisions from Law No. 133 from 1975 were subsequently applied to the nature reserve.  \\n\nGeography\nLocated in the dry orographic rain shadow of the Cordillera Central , Puerto Rico\\'s driest area, temperatures in the forest are, on average, around 80 °F (27 °C) in shaded areas and 100 °F (38 °C) in exposed areas.  The average temperature is 25.3 °C (77.5 °F) and the average annual rainfall is 791 millimetres (31.1 in).  \\n\nGeology\nThe dry forest is located on the Southern karst region of Puerto Rico. The soils in the state forest include limestone, fine and soft lime soil which include areas of sand and clay where deciduous plants grow, and sand and clay soils where evergreen plants thrive.   \\n\nEcology\nThe Guánica State Forest is of great natural complexity and scientific importance as it serves as a critical habitat to numerous species of animals and plants that are unique to the region. Its ecosystems include sandy beaches, rocky shores, mangrove forests, seagrass prairies, coral reefs, limestone caverns, saltwater lagoons, salt flats and different types of dry forests (both deciduous and evergreen).  \\n\nThe last remaining natural population of Puerto Rican crested toads ( Peltophryne lemur ) can be found in the intermittent freshwater pools which are created by seasonal rains. This species proliferates in the natural conditions created by the karstic geology of the forest, and current efforts by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) include breeding programs and projects to release individuals of this species in similar ecosystems in Coamo and in the Northern karst of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nApproximately half of Puerto Rico\\'s birds and nine of sixteen the endemic bird species occur in the Guánica State Forest. In addition to the Puerto Rican crested toad, other protected animal species in the forest include the Puerto Rican vireo ( Vireo latimeri ), the Puerto Rican nightjar ( Antrostomus noctitherus ), the red land crab ( Gecarcinus ruricola ), and the Mona basket shrimp ( Typhlatya monae ). The dry forest is also one of the few habitats where the Cook\\'s pallid anole ( Anolis cooki ) can be found. The coral reefs and maritime areas of the forest reserve are also home to numerous coral, animal and plant species, such as the West Indian manatee which feeds on seaweeds, found in underwater prairies in the reserve.  \\n\nThe vegetation in the forest is divided into three main groups: upland deciduous forest (which occupies 23.5 square kilometres or 9.1 square miles), semi- evergreen forest (7.2 square kilometres or 2.8 square miles), and scrub forest (5.8 square kilometres or 2.2 square miles).  Similar to other insular dry forests species diversity is low; between 30 and 50 tree species are found per hectare.  More than 700 plant species, of which 48 are endangered and 16 are endemic to the forest, occur within the forest. Some of the endangered plant species in the forest include the sebucan cactus ( Leptocereus quadricostatus ), the palo de rosa ( Ottoschulzia rhodoxylon ), the violeta tree ( Polygala cowellii ), and the critically endangered bariaco ( Trichilia triacantha ).  One of the most famous plant inhabitants of the forest is an old-growth guaiacwood tree or guayacán ( Guaiacum officinale ) often called the Guayacán Centenario (\"the centenary guaiacwood\") which could be as old as 1,000 years-old.  \\n\nRecreation\nThe dry forest is open to visitors and some of its beaches are popular with tourists and locals alike. Fishing and biking are allowed in special designated areas, while scuba diving is also popular in the coral reefs and in the beaches. There are 12 hiking trails with varying difficulties open to visitors and the reserve is also popular for birdwatching .    \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nHacienda Buena Vista\n\\n\nHacienda Buena Vista , also known as Hacienda Vives (or Buena Vista Plantation in English ), was a coffee plantation located in Barrio Magueyes , Ponce, Puerto Rico . The original plantation dates from the 19th century. The plantation was started by Don Salvador de Vives in 1833.   \\n\nThe Hacienda is located on 81.79 acres (331,000 m 2 ) of fertile land that includes a humid subtropical forest some 7 miles (11 km) north of Ponce on Route PR-123,  in Corral Viejo, a subbarrio of Barrio Magueyes .  The plantation house was built in the Spanish Colonial style , with the surrounding buildings being built in the local Criollo style.  The original Hacienda covered 482 cuerdas (approx. 468 acres).  \\n\nIt is now owned by the Fideicomiso de Conservación de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Conservation Trust) , which operates it as a museum which it opened in 1986.\\n\nSignificance\nThe Hacienda is significant for various reasons. First, it contains the only remaining example of the Barker hydraulic turbine, which was the first reaction type turbine ever made.  It was nominated as a Mechanical Engineering landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in July 1994.   \\n\nThe second reason Hacienda Buena Vista is significant is that it offers one of the best remaining examples of a Puerto Rican coffee plantation . This is important because in the latter part of the nineteenth century the coffee produced in Puerto Rico and exported to Europe and the United States was considered among the finest in the world. It is said to have even been the favorite at the Vatican at the time.  Hacienda Buena Vista is also significant because it shows the evolution of the coffee industry in the region. Various periods can be appreciated. These range from the cultivation of produce such as plantains (1833-1845); to the production of flour (from rice and corn) (1847-1872). These products were staples for the subsistence of the local population.  \\n\nBrief history\nHacienda Buena Vista was started as a truck farm to produce mostly plantains , bananas , corn and avocados , by Don Salvador de Vives in 1833.   De Vives was a Catalan immigrant arriving from Venezuela and he set up the farm to sell its produce in the Ponce market and in the sugarcane estates along the southern coast. Originally, the Vives estate covered 500 acres (2.0 km 2 ).\\n\nIn 1845, the son of Don Salvador added a corn mill operation to the profitable fruit and vegetable production. Later, Don Salvador\\'s grandson oversaw the addition of coffee growing and processing to the plantains and cornmeal, taking advantage of the great coffee-growing boom of the 1880s and 1890s. Don Salvador\\'s son and grandson introduced some of the most innovative farm machinery on the island, powered by a nearby 100-foot (30 m) waterfall.  Eventually Hacienda Buena Vista would become one of the most successful plantations in the mountains of Puerto Rico.\\n\nA series of hurricanes and the failing coffee market brought operations at the Hacienda to a standstill by 1900, and gradually Hacienda Buena Vista fell into disrepair and was partially abandoned.  \\n\nBy 1937 agriculture had seriously declined in Puerto Rico, and the plantation was abandoned, becoming mostly a weekend country house for the Vives heirs. Worker barracks, outbuildings and equipment deteriorated rapidly under the humid tropical climate and rainfall.\\n\nIn 1984, the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust bought 86 of the original 500 acres (2.0 km 2 ), with the intention of restoring it. Despite the grave deterioration of the coffee-processing machinery and the farm buildings, the Conservation Trust managed to restore the estate so that it could be used to educate the public about the golden era of fine coffee growing in the mountains of Puerto Rico. The original owners donated many of the furnishings, and the Conservation Trust purchased other authentic pieces.  \\n\nHacienda Buena Vista is today a well-known educational destination. The machinery of the original Hacienda has been put in motion again, farm animals roam the grounds, the farmhouse rooms have been furnished, and the scent of freshly roasted coffee fills the surrounding air.  Visitors can take tours through the old Vives country home and explore the plantation buildings and grounds. Authentic 19th-century farm machinery is exhibited that shows how a coffee plantation worked in the 1880s.\\n\nSalvador Vives\nSalvador Vives arrived in Puerto Rico from Venezuela fleeing the struggle for independence going on in that country at the beginning of the nineteenth century. At the time he was a 12-year Spanish career officer from the province of Catalonia in Spain, who had been stationed in Caracas , until he was forced to leave after the defeat of the Spanish Army in the battle of Carabobo in 1821. It was thus that Vives traveled from Venezuela to Puerto Rico on 27 June 1821 with his wife Isabel Diaz and son Carlos. Accompanying him were also two slaves. He settled in the southern port city of Ponce, where the sugar industry was booming.  \\n\nWith no capital to buy sugarcane-growing land, Salvador Vives worked for the municipal government of Ponce during the 1820s and 1830s in assisting other displaced Spanish emigrants and also as a public notary . By 1838 he had enough money to purchase 482 acres (1.95 km 2 ) of hilly, undeveloped, tropical forest land in barrio Magueyes , to the north of the city of Ponce, and near the Canas River .\\n\nThe land consisted mostly mountainous terrain with thick forest, and far from the town. Fortunately, Vives was able to purchase the lands relatively cheap for the lands in greatest demand at that time were the rich flatlands near the coast that provided the perfect conditions for the sugar-growing industry.  The development of a new road in that area, PR-123 , would also guarantee that products from Vives\\' future farm could be bought down for sale to the marketplace in Ponce with relative easy. The construction of the farm-to-market PR-123 road would prove to be a factor in the success of Vives\\' hacienda.\\n\nVives' Hacienda\nHacienda Buena Vista grew plantains , beans , yams , and corn which were bought at Plaza del Mercado Isabel II in Ponce by the area sugar plantation owners to feed the slave labor force of their plantations. The hacienda also grew other crops, including cotton , coffee , and rice and it also raised cattle , oxen , mules and horses in the limited lower pastures of the hacienda, in the vicinity of the hacienda\\'s buildings complex. Initially, the hacienda\\'s principal crop was plantain ( Musa acuminata \\xc3\\x97 balbisiana ). By 1845 there were 40 acres (160,000 m 2 ) growing this crop. This acreage grew steadily from the mid-1820s to the early 1840s. Between 1852 and 1860 the production of plantains at the farm had increased from 329,200 to 475,380.  \\n\nIn 1837 Vives purchased a corn mill, a coffee depulper, a cotton gin, and a rice husking machine, all animal-powered, to process its agricultural goods. During the 1840s the hacienda\\'s economic activity had diversified into produce production and corn flour distribution throughout Puerto Rico\\'s central coastal region.  The purchase and installation of the corn mill proved to be a great investment for Vives. Not only did his financial earnings multiplied, but he was also able to gain enough prominence to be elected mayor of Ponce , between 1841 and 1845. He served three terms as mayor. During his terms as mayor, Vives had the District Court Center moved from Coamo to Ponce, he also had the City Hall built, and arranged for the official coat of arms of the city with the Spanish crown .  \\n\nAfter Salvador Vives\\' death in 1845, his son Carlos took over the management of the hacienda. \"Carlos perceived the production of corn meal to feed sugar plantation slaves would be of enough economic importance to finance the construction of a water-powered corn mill to replace the animal-powered corn mill built by his father. Built between 1845 and 1847, the new corn mill installed by Carlos Vives had a sixteen-foot-diameter wooden water wheel that moved the gears for the grinding stones of the corn mill. Carlos powered the new corn mill with water derived from the waterfall on the Canas River that traveled through a 2,600-foot-long (790 m) water canal, which was begun in 1847 and completed in 1851. Within the corn mill structure, Carlos also built a corn toasting room where corn was dried before it was milled. Carlos completed many of the hacienda structures and buildings that today are part of the complex, including the slave quarters, the manor house , the warehouse, and the carriage house with stables for horses and mules .\"  \\n\nThe building of the now-historic Barker engine also came under son Carlos Vives tenancy: \"In 1847, with the demand for milled corn rising given the increase in sugar plantation slaves around Ponce, Carlos constructed another building for a new corn mill powered with a hydraulic turbine from the West Point Foundry , in Cold Spring, New York . The turbine was patented in the United States, in 1843, by James Whitelaw , of Scotland . The flour from Hacienda Buena Vista gained islandwide prominence due to its excellent quality. From 1847 to 1873, the corn flour of the hacienda reigned supreme over other local mills. Shortly afterwards, a corn mill to pulverize the corn was mounted, and the hacienda\\'s white and yellow corn flour received the gold medal for excellence in the second public exposition celebrated in San Juan in June 1855.\"  In 1860, the hacienda won awards again at the Puerto Rico Exposition Fair.  \\n\nCarlos Vives died in 1872. Around this time the sales volume of corn meal, one of the hacienda\\'s primary products, began to decline. Instead of demand for corn meal, world demand for Puerto Rican coffee, was starting to become as significant an export crop as sugar for which Vives could not afford the price of the lands. Envisioning a future for coffee production, in 1892 Carlos\\'s eldest son (also named Salvador Vives like his grandfather) installed coffee depulping and bean husking machine in the old corn mill and ran them both using the original mill wheel. \"Production of corn meal and coffee provided a diversified economic basis for the continued success of the hacienda.\"  \\n\nSome of the best Puerto Rican coffee was produced in the central mountain area of the island around Yauco , Ponce, Lares , Maricao , Utuado , and Cayey .  The Vives' family hacienda lands were also ideal for coffee production. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Hacienda Buena Vista produced and processed over 5 tons of coffee a year, just for export to Europe. The good days of coffee production at Hacienda Buena Vista, however, came to an end during the dawn of the 20th century when a series of three yearly natural and politico-economic disasters took place, and coffee production in all of Puerto Rico fell from 338 tons to only 8 tons per year.  \\n\nIn 1899, hurricane San Ciriaco struck a hard blow to coffee production in Puerto Rico. After this hurricane, Puerto Rico would never become a coffee exporter again. To exacerbate this, in 1900 the worldwide price of coffee fell to levels that made it considerably more difficult to compete. The third blow came in 1901, when Puerto Rico was included into the United States Customs System, setting the local coffee production at a competitive disadvantage over its European markets. It also dropped Puerto Rico\\'s favored status in US markets. To compensate, the Salvador Vives switched to a successful orange growing program for the New York City market. This new phase of agriculture continued until 1956.  \\n\nDescription of the hacienda\nHacienda Buena Vista is located in Barrio Magueyes , in the municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico at between 160 and 460 meters above sea level. The hills near the hacienda buildings are excellent for cultivating corn , coffee , and fruits . The nearby Canas River provides the power for the power needed to run the hacienda\\'s mills.  \\n\nThe hacienda today is made up of an 87-acre (350,000 m 2 ) agricultural complex. Its main buildings are grouped together in a 3-acre (12,000 m 2 ) central area and the property includes 11 original buildings: the hacienda manor house, the carriage house, the horse stables, the mule stables, the caretaker\\'s house and office, two warehouses, a hurricane shelter, the corn mill, and the slave quarters. There is a water canal system that is still operative, an aqueduct , and a house garden. The coffee bean processing building was rebuilt to look like the original 1892 building.  \\n\nThe manor house is a 2-story 60x50ft building. It was built in 1845. The ground floor was designed to be used for storage. The second floor contains three bedrooms and a living room. The eastern half of the manor house is made of brick and includes a courtyard, the kitchen, two more bedrooms and a bathroom. The manor house also has garden surrounded by a wrought iron -and-brick fence. The garden served two purposes: \"Historically, this garden served as the formal entrance to the hacienda complex; however, it was most often used as a private family place.\"  Dependent on horses for managing the hacienda, its administrators also built a carriage house, stables, and a small caretaker\\'s house.  In addition mule stables and caretaker\\'s office were also built.  Located opposite the manor house, is the hurricane shelter . It is a solid brick structure measuring 15 ft (4.6 m). x 25 ft (7.6 m), and built 3 ft (0.91 m). above ground. Its walls, floor and ceiling were made to withstand or dissipate the destructive tropical storms that are common in this region.  \\n\nAn important component of the plantation was the brick-and-mortar canal which is (18 in. deep by 12 in. wide) and runs some 2,600 feet (790 m). A water drop height of 360 meters provides the energy needed to run the mills in the hacienda. Vives paid 360 Spanish pesos for the 58 acres (230,000 m 2 ) that comprise the area of the Canas River to pride for his canal. The use of the River for the hacienda was authorized by the Spanish Colonial Government in Puerto Rico. The canal and aqueduct were finished in 1851. A series of manifolds are used for diverting the water according to the needs of the hacienda agricultural production: one gate diverts water to the water wheel and the corn mill water turbine, another gate diverts water to the fermentation tank, the ornamental washbasin, and the bath, and a third gate diverts water to a race which sends water back to the Canas River.  \\n\nThe coffee de-pulping and husking mill is a 2-story wooden building located to the northwest of the Hacienda manor house. It originally housed the 1845 corn mill but in 1892, with the need for processing the coffee beans produced by Hacienda Buena Vista, the structure was modified to become the coffee husking mill.  \\n\nA second corn mill at Hacienda Buena Vista was built in 1854. It is a two-story wood-frame structure measuring 16 ft (4.9 m). wide by 25 ft 4 in (7.72 m) long. The actual corn-milling work took place on the floor of this mill. Dried corn making it thru a hopper in this building was processed here. Grinding of the corn into corn meal occurred here. It was also packer into bags here. One of the canals of the aqueduct system ran underneath this building to power the corn mill above.  As required for the production of ground coffee, a bean drying station was also built. Thus building dates from 1847. The building had previously served as slave quarters, but after the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico in 1873, it was converted into a bean drying building. The pans used for drying the coffee beans were kept in this building as well.  \\n\n\"The hydraulic turbine for the corn mill was ordered by a Mr. Bennet, in August 1853, as agent for Don Carlos Vives, from the West Point Foundry in Cold Spring, New York . The purchase was made through the Maitland and Phelps Company, also of New York. The turbine follows the design patented by James Whitelaw and James Stirrat, of Paisley, Renfew, Scotland , in 1841.\"  \\n\nTechnology at the hacienda\nHacienda Buena Vista stood out from among the other haciendas in the region for the use of sophisticated machinery:  \\n\n\"The Scotch-type turbine on the pit\\'s floor of the corn mill is a unique piece of hydraulic technology machinery, recognized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Although the turbine is not a classic 17th-century Baker\\'s centrifugal or reaction turbine wheel it might be a transformed one, since this \"Buena Vista Turbine\" does not fit within the Baker\\'s description. Nevertheless, the wheels have an element in common since their arms are very similar in so far as it refers to shape, position, and function. On the other hand, it is not a Scotch turbine either, being this a modification of the Baker turbine. Apparently, the Buena Vista turbine builder used the Scotch turbine principles to make the one in situ , adapting at the same time parts of the Baker\\'s design with added improvements of its own. It is significant that in the mid-1840s\\xe2\\x80\\x94while the hacienda was being developed\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Scotch turbine was being patented in the United States after European designs (particularly the La Cour\\'s centrifugal wheel). R. L. Johnson assessed the \"Buena Vista Turbine\" in the following way:\\n\nOnly the three Scotch turbines\\xe2\\x80\\x94first patented in the 1840s\\xe2\\x80\\x94are known to exist in the United States.... This acute shortage of extant early hydromachinery is the principal reason why the technological history of the water motor remains obscure and relatively poorly documented...Recently, however, the discovery of a unique turbine located on a plantation at Ponce, near the south coast of Puerto Rico, promised to open a new window on the past.... The turbine at Hacienda Buena Vista\\xe2\\x80 6is the only pre-Scotch type-known to exist and is the sole extant example of a pioneer and historically important machine that was invented at the close of the 17th century by Dr. Baker.... The Buena Vista turbine is, in effect, a missing link in the evolution of mechanical artifacts better known to the historians of technology. ( The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology , Vol. 4, No. 1 , pp. 55-58).\"  \\n\nLegacy\nOn 16 July 1994, Robert B. Gaither of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers presented a plaque to the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust designating the Hacienda Buena Vista\\'s hydraulic turbine as a National Historic Monument of Mechanical Engineering. The award was given in recognition not only of the value of the turbine but also of the extraordinary work the Conservation Trust carried in its restoration.  \\n\nLater and current use\nIn 1956, the government of Puerto Rico expropriated most of the lands of Buena Vista as a result of a new law to provide land to local farmers. Only 87 acres of land remained with the Vives, including the manor house and the water channel system. These 87 acres were acquired by the Fideicomiso de Conservación de Puerto Rico (Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico) in 1984. In 1986, the Trust restored the hacienda to much of its past glory and turned it into a museum.   The museum opened in 1987. The museum is the only farm museum in Puerto Rico. In 1988, the Trust entirely rebuilt the coffee mill to its 1892 look.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links"

A large hacienda , it was founded in 1830, by Juan Bautista Plumey, a French immigrant, who arrived in Puerto Rico with enslaved people. (Juan Bautista Plumey was born in France on September 8, 1797, and named Jean Baptiste Henri Plumey.)  \\n\nIt would become the largest coffee plantation in Lares, with over thirty slaves and hundreds of day laborers working the 69 cuerdas of coffee farm. For many years the plantation was a large producer and exporter of coffee. Day laborers , jornaleros or braceros from Lares worked in the coffee fields of the hacienda . In 1880, it was owned by  Miguel Marquez Enseñat.\\n\nIt is now owned by Edwin Soto and his family, who invested millions into its restoration and operate the hacienda as a hotel, coffee shop and a living museum recreating the historical setting of the height of coffee production in Puerto Rico. Coffee growing in Puerto Rico has seen a resurgence and Hacienda Lealtad produces coffee under the brand Café Lealtad. The Café Bistro Hacienda Lealtad on Puerto Rico Highway 128 kilometer 55.8, is where groups meet for the start of their tour of the 19th century coffee plantation.\\n\nBrief history\nLares was founded on April 26, 1827, and became an important location of coffee production in Puerto Rico. In 1830, Juan Bautista Plumey established Hacienda Lealtad, the coffee producing farm. Plumey, a French immigrant  had come to Lares with 32 slaves.  On May 20, 1833, he married Petronila Irizarry from nearby San Sebastián, Puerto Rico (Pepino) and they had twelve children.  José María Marxuach Echavarría , twice mayor of San Juan, married one of Juan Bautista Plumey daughters.\\n\nAfter Plumey established Hacienda Lealtad, it became the largest and most modern of its time given it was the first to generate its own electricity to power the hacienda\\'s machinery and mills. A canal and aqueduct guided water from the mountainside to a 17-foot hydraulic wheel that generated power to the plantation.    \\n\nBy 1846, Juan Bautista Plumey\\'s hacienda which at the time was called Hacienda La Esperanza \"was the only property registered as an hacienda in official documents. He had 69 cuerdas planted in coffee worked by 33 slaves.\"  Plumey did not allow his workers to work on other farms.   \\n\nIn 1868, Lares was the site of Grito de Lares , a two-day revolt against the crown of Spain.  While some documents state that people from Hacienda Lealtad participated in the revolt, a historian named Joseph Harrison Flores, with the National Archives of Puerto Rico, studied the history of the estate and Grito de Lares  and stated that only an eight-year-old child of a slave from Hacienda Lealtad was at the revolt, and spent 6 months in prison.\\n\nIn 1873, slavery was abolished and, \"by the 1880s coffee had replaced sugar as Puerto Rico\\'s leading export staple and principal source of wealth.\"  \\n\nIn 1880, when it was called Hacienda Paraiso, it was owned by Miguel Marquez Enseñat  who paid workers with hacienda token money , which could only be used to purchase goods from a store at the hacienda itself.  \\n\nCoffee production and exportation dropped considerably after Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States with the 1898 Treaty of Paris , and eventually, the plantation fell into disuse and decline.\\n\nThe place had sentimental value to Edwin Soto, a Puerto Rican businessman from Lares, who had picked ripe coffee beans there as a child. Soto decided he would buy the hacienda as a second home.  While Soto\\'s initial intentions for the property, when he purchased it in 2007, were to keep it as a second home he later decided to restore it for its historic importance. Soto invested millions of dollars into its restoration and Hacienda Lealtad is now a living museum, a hotel, coffee shop, offering educational tours to local and international tourists. It also serves as a place for people in the agriculture and coffee industry to meet and hold workshops.\\n\nIn 2014, the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture began an initiative to develop agricultural tourism and in 2016, Hacienda Lealtad was endorsed by the Puerto Rico Tourism Company ( Compañia de Turismo de Puerto Rico ). Since the start of its restoration Café Lealtad, Inc., as the company is called, has purchased coffee seeds and other equipment and services from the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture.   \\n\nStudents of agriculture and members of agricultural associations visit Hacienda Lealtad in groups for workshops  and as Puerto Rico continues to strengthen its agricultural industry, thirty Puerto Rican farmers completed an intensive, eight-week course on the business side of agriculture, at the hacienda.  The University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez opened an Hacienda Lealtad Café in early 2019.  \\n\nTours were underway regularly until Hurricane Maria hit on September 20, 2017. A week after a relieved Soto reported that Hurricane Irma had not done much damage to the coffee trees on the estate, Hurricane Maria destroyed all the coffee trees, around 60,000. Clean-up, restoration and planting began anew soon afterwards and tours and functions at the hacienda resumed.\\n\nA few months after Hurricane Maria struck, a meeting was held by the Secretary of Agriculture, farmers and stakeholders at Hacienda Lealtad.\\n\nAttractions\nThe 19th century, coffee farming culture of Puerto Rico where jornaleros  and slaves processed coffee for its distribution to Europe, is on display at Hacienda Lealtad. Educational tours where people can learn about coffee cultivation are available, by reservation, and the main attractions are:    \\n\nCoffee growing\nThere\\'s been a resurgence in coffee growing in Puerto Rico, despite the lack of manpower and other challenges facing coffee farm landowners.  Hacienda Lealtad in Lares has a coffee shop called Café Bistro Hacienda Lealtad. Café Lareño Coffee Shop is nearby and other such chic coffee shops have opened up along the mountainous hilltops of Lares and other municipalities in Puerto Rico.  Lares has been the Puerto Rican municipality with the largest emigration to the mainland United States, since being hit by a severe economic recession.  \\n\nIn media and popular culture\nThe dress worn by Keysi Vargas, Puerto Rican contestant in the 2015 Miss World Beauty pageant, represented Hacienda Lealtad coffee.   \\n\nIn 2015, a made-for-television movie , La Cenicienta Boricua (Puerto Rican Cinderella) was filmed at Hacienda Lealtad   and released on Telemundo .  \\n\nGallery\nScenes around Hacienda Lealtad:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

Several organizations have made efforts to restore it, and in 2014, the Comité Casa Klumb was founded.  The World Monuments Fund added the house to its 2014 World Monuments Watch list, which helps in the process of gathering funds to restore monuments.  According to Dr. Enrique Vivoni Farange, director of the Architectural and Construction Archives of the University of Puerto Rico, the costs of restoring the house ascend to $1.9 million.   \\n\nThe residence was destroyed in a fire that started at around 11:15PM (AST), on the night of November 10, 2020.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

It comprises the ruins of a village church that was abandoned in the early 19th century when the community, with the permission of Governor Salvador Meléndez , moved to a more favorable location nearer the coast, which became the modern town of Isabela , founded in 1819.   \\n\nThe hermitage was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1983,  and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.  The ruins are easily accessible from the main PR-2 road.  \\n\nHistory\nAround 1725, Spanish Governor of Puerto Rico José Antonio de Mendizábal y Azares, granted authorization to base a population on the existing hermitage and village. Its given name, San Antonio de La Tuna, derives from the avocation of the Spanish settlers to the saint Anthony of Padua and after the abundance of prickly pears growing in the region ( Opuntia or tuna , in Spanish). At the end of the 18th century San Antonio de la Tuna had a church, more than sixty houses, and almost 1,200 inhabitants, which was a considerable population for those times.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n\nThis article about a property in Puerto Rico on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub .

        "page_content": "Contents\nHiram Bithorn Stadium\nHiram Bithorn Stadium  is a baseball park in San Juan, Puerto Rico , built in 1962 and designed by Puerto Rican architect Pedro Miranda.  The stadium is home to the Cangrejeros de Santurce of the Puerto Rican Baseball League (LBPRC), and briefly was home to Major League Baseball \\'s Montreal Expos during their final years.\\n\nIt is operated by the municipal government of the city of San Juan. Its name honors the first Puerto Rican to play in the major leagues, Hiram Bithorn , who first played with the Chicago Cubs in 1942. Built in 1962, under the mayoral administration of Felisa Rincón de Gautier as a replacement for Estadio Sixto Escobar , it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.  \\n\nDimensions\nThe stadium has approximately 18,000 seats. The stadium is 325 feet (99 m) down the left-field line, 325 feet (99 m) down the right-field line and 404 feet (123 m) to center field. The fences are 8 feet (2.5 m) high. When the Expos played home games at Hiram Bithorn, the field dimensions were set to match Olympic Stadium in Montreal.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Hiram Bithorn Stadium was opened in 1962.\\n\nThe first outdoor National Basketball Association game was played between the Phoenix Suns and the Milwaukee Bucks on September 24, 1972, during that year\\'s preseason. The Suns defeated the Bucks, 116-103.\\n\nIn the mid-1990s Hiram Bithorn Stadium was planned to be the home of the yet-to-be-named Puerto Rico team, a charter franchise of the United League (UL) which was a planned third league of Major League Baseball (MLB).\\n\nThe stadium hosted Major League Baseball \\'s Opening Day Game in 2001, in which the Toronto Blue Jays faced the Texas Rangers in an American League match-up.  However, 4,000 who bought tickets were turned away when the police determined the safe capacity of the park had been vastly exceeded.\\n\nIt was the object of a major overhaul under the mayoral administration of Jorge Santini , before becoming the part-time home of the Montreal Expos of the National League in 2003 and 2004 before their move to Washington, D.C. as the Washington Nationals . The Expos played 20 \"home\" games across the two seasons as a result of poor attendance at their home Olympic Stadium in Montreal. Before Major League Baseball\\'s announcement of the Montreal Expos\\' move to Washington, Puerto Rico and San Juan made an effort to lure the Expos franchise to the island territory permanently.\\n\nHiram Bithorn Stadium hosted parts of the first two rounds of the 2006 World Baseball Classic . Pool C , which included the teams of Puerto Rico , Cuba , Panama , and the Netherlands , was played there. It also hosted Pool 2 of the second round of the Classic which featured Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic , and Venezuela , the top two finishers from Pool C and Pool D . Pool D games of the 2009 World Baseball Classic were played there between March 7 and March 11, 2009. The Hiram Bithorn Stadium hosted the 2013 World Baseball Classic with Puerto Rico , Venezuela , the Dominican Republic and newcomers Spain in Pool C.\\n\nIn 2008, it served as the stadium for Atléticos de San Juan and Academia Quintana , two soccer teams in the Puerto Rico Soccer League , Puerto Rico \\'s first-ever professional soccer league.\\n\nIn 2010, Major League Baseball returned to the stadium, as the Florida Marlins faced the New York Mets in a three-game series during the regular season.  \\n\nThe Marlins were to play the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 30 and 31, 2016 in honor of Roberto Clemente Day. However, on May 6, 2016, it was announced that the Puerto Rico games would be postponed due to the Zika virus outbreak , and moved to Marlins Park .  \\n\nThe Cleveland Indians and Minnesota Twins played a two-game series at Hiram Bithorn Stadium on April 17 and 18, 2018.  It is the first time since 2010 that a Major League Baseball regular-season game was played in Puerto Rico. Furthermore, the league announced in August 2019 that they would be returning for a three-game series in April 2020 between the Miami Marlins and New York Mets .  This series was later cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic .  \\n\nThere have been, as of June 2020, 71 professional boxing events that have been held at the stadium, including many world championship fights.  Two-time World Lightweight Champion Carlos Ortíz won four Lightweight title bouts in the stadium, regaining his championship from Ismael Laguna in 1965 and retaining it against Doug Valiant in 1963, Kenny Lane in 1964, and Sugar Ramos in 1967.  Also, former world heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson fought there late in his career.  \\n\nOther uses\nAlong with sporting events, the stadium has hosted concerts by many famous artists.\\n\nMetallica were scheduled to perform during their Nowhere Else to Roam Tour on April 28, 1993, but it was rained out and never rescheduled.\\n\nShakira has performed twice, during her Tour Anfibio , on April 9, 2000, and during the Tour of the Mongoose , on March 22, 2003.\\n\nOn March 10, 11, and 12 of 2023, the Colombian singer Karol G performed three special shows at the stadium, in support of her 2023 album Mañana Será Bonito .

        "page_content": "Contents\nHorse racing\n\\n\nHorse racing is an equestrian performance activity, typically involving two or more horses ridden by jockeys (or sometimes driven without riders) over a set distance for competition. It is one of the most ancient of all sports, as its basic premise - to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance - has been mostly unchanged since at least classical antiquity .  \\n\nHorse races vary widely in format, and many countries have developed their own particular traditions around the sport. Variations include restricting races to particular breeds , running over obstacles, running over different distances, running on different track surfaces , and running in different gaits . In some races, horses are assigned different weights to carry to reflect differences in ability, a process known as handicapping.  \\n\nWhile horses are sometimes raced purely for sport, a major part of horse racing\\'s interest and economic importance is in the gambling associated with it,  an activity that in 2019 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115 billion.  \\n\nWorld Championship\nInternational Federation of Horseracing Authorities was founded in 1961 and 1983 but now (2024) have not an official World Horse Racing Championship.      \\n\nHistory\nHorse racing has a long and distinguished history and has been practiced in civilizations across the world since ancient times. Archaeological records indicate that horse racing occurred in Ancient Greece , Ancient Rome , Babylon , Syria , Arabia , and Egypt .  It also plays an important part of myth and legend, such as in the contest between the steeds of the god Odin and the giant Hrungnir in Norse mythology .\\n\nChariot racing was one of the most popular sports of ancient Greece , Rome and the Byzantine Empire . By 648 BCE, both chariot and mounted horse racing events were part of the ancient Greek Olympics ,  and were important in the other Panhellenic Games . Chariot racing was dangerous to both driver and horse, often leading to serious injury and even death. In the Roman Empire , chariot and mounted horse racing were major industries.  From the mid-fifth century BCE, spring carnival in Rome closed with a horse race. Fifteen to twenty riderless horses, originally imported from the Barbary Coast of North Africa , were set loose to run the length of the Via del Corso , a long, straight city street. The race lasted about two-and-a-half minutes.\\n\nIn later times, Thoroughbred racing became popular with British royalty and aristocrats, earning it the title of \"Sport of Kings\".  \\n\nHistorically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and displayed the horsemanship required for battle. Horse racing evolved from impromptu competitions among riders and drivers. The various forms of competition, which required demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment. The popularity of equestrian sports throughout the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have vanished once horses were no longer used in combat.  \\n\nIn Britain, horse racing became well-established in the 18th century, and continued to grow in popularity. King Charles II (reigned 1649 to 1685) was an avid sportsman who gave Newmarket its prominence. By 1750, the Jockey Club was formed as a way to control the Newmarket races, set the rules of the game, prevent dishonesty, and create a level field.  The Epsom Derby began in 1780. The first of the five classic races began with the St Leger Stakes in 1776. In 1814, the system was complete with five annual races.  While Newmarket and the Jockey Club set the standards, most of the racing took place in landowners\\' fields and in rising towns for small cash prizes and enormous local prestige. The system of wagering was essential to  funding and growing of the industry, and all classes, from paupers to royalty participated. Members of high society were in control, and they made a special effort to keep out the riff-raff and to keep the criminal element away from the wagering. With real money at stake, the system needed skilled jockeys, trainers, grooms, and experts at breeding, which opened up new careers for working-class rural men. Every young ambitious stable boy could dream of making it big.  \\n\nIn addition to its rich history, horse racing is marked by noteworthy statistics. The Thoroughbred Secretariat still holds the fastest times in the 1973 Triple Crown races. Jockey Russell Baze demonstrated exceptional skill with an unmatched 12,842 victories. Economic significance is reflected in the career earnings of the American Pharoah, totaling over $8.6 million. These quantifiable achievements add another facet to the captivating history of horse racing.\"\\n\nHorse racing was one of the few sports that continued during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis,  with the Australian and Hong Kong racing jurisdictions carrying on, albeit with no crowds. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France were some of the more prominent racing bodies to either postpone or cancel all events.\\n\nTypes of horse racing\nThere are many types of horse racing, including:\\n\nDifferent breeds of horses have been bred to excel in each of these disciplines. Breeds that are used for flat racing include the Thoroughbred , Quarter Horse , Arabian , Paint , and Appaloosa .  Jump racing breeds include the Thoroughbred and AQPS . In harness racing, Standardbreds are used in Australia, New Zealand and North America. In Europe, Russian and French Trotters are used with Standardbreds. Light cold blood horses, such as Finnhorses and Scandinavian Coldblood Trotters are also used in harness racing within their respective geographical areas.\\n\nThere are also races for ponies: both flat and jump  and harness racing.  \\n\nFlat racing is the most common form of horse racing seen worldwide. Flat racing tracks are typically oval in shape and are generally level, although in Great Britain and Ireland there is much greater variation, including figure-of-eight tracks like Windsor and tracks with often severe gradients and changes of camber, such as Epsom Racecourse . Track surfaces vary, with turf most common in Europe and dirt more common in North America and Asia. Newly designed synthetic surfaces, such as Polytrack or Tapeta , are seen at some tracks.\\n\nIndividual flat races are run over distances ranging from 440 yards (400 m) to more than four miles (6.4 km), although races longer than two miles (3.2 km) are quite rare, and distances between five and twelve furlongs (1.0 and 2.4 km) are the most common. Short races are generally referred to as \"sprints\", while longer races are known as \"routes\" in the United States or \"staying races\" in Europe. Although fast acceleration (\"a turn of foot\") is usually required to win either type of race, in general sprints are seen as a test of speed, while long-distance races are seen as a test of stamina. The most prestigious flat races in the world, such as the Prix de l\\'Arc de Triomphe , Melbourne Cup , Japan Cup , Epsom Derby , Kentucky Derby and Dubai World Cup , are run over distances in the middle of this range and are seen as tests of both speed and stamina to some extent.\\n\nIn the most prestigious races, horses are generally allocated the same weight to carry for fairness, with allowances given to younger horses and female horses running against males. These races are called conditions races and offer the biggest purses . There is another category of races called handicap races where each horse is assigned a different weight to carry based on its ability.  Besides the weight they carry, horses\\' performance can also be influenced by position relative to the inside barrier, sex, jockey, and training.\\n\nJump (or jumps) racing in Great Britain and Ireland is known as National Hunt racing (although, confusingly, National Hunt racing also includes flat races taking place at jumps meetings; these are known as National Hunt flat races). Jump racing can be subdivided into steeplechasing and hurdling , according to the type and size of obstacles being jumped. The word \"steeplechasing\" can also refer collectively to any type of jump race in certain racing jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.\\n\nTypically, horses progress to bigger obstacles and longer distances as they get older, so that a European jumps horse will tend to start in National Hunt flat races as a juvenile, move on to hurdling after a year or so, and then, if thought capable, move on to steeplechasing.\\n\nA type of racing where horses go around a track while pulling a sulky and a driver behind them. In this sport, Standardbreds are used. These horses are separated into two categories, trotters and pacers. Pacers move the legs on each side of their body in tandem, while trotters move their diagonal legs together. The latter are typically faster than the former due to the gaits used.  Occasionally a horse will break their gait into an actual canter or gallop. This could cause the loss of a race or even a disqualification.  Notable races include the Hambletonian and the Breeder\\'s Crown series.  \\n\nRidden trot races are more common in places such as Europe and New Zealand. These horses are trotters who race on the flat under saddle with a jockey on their backs.  \\n\nThe length of an endurance race varies greatly. Some are very short, only ten miles, while other races can be up to one hundred miles. There are a few races that are even longer than one hundred miles and last multiple days.  These different lengths of races are divided into five categories: pleasure rides (10-20 miles), non-competitive trail rides (21-27 miles), competitive trail rides (20-45 miles), progressive trail rides (25-60 miles), and endurance rides (40-100 miles in one day, up to 250 miles (400 km) in multiple days).  Because each race is very long, trails of natural terrain are generally used.\\n\nContemporary organized endurance racing began in California around 1955, and the first race marked the beginning of the Tevis Cup  This race was a one-hundred-mile, one-day-long ride starting in Squaw Valley , Placer County , and ending in Auburn . Founded in 1972, the American Endurance Ride Conference was the United States\\' first national endurance riding association.  The longest endurance race in the world is the Mongol Derby , which is 1,000 km (620 mi) long.  \\n\nBreeds\nIn most horse races, entry is restricted to certain breeds; that is, the horse must have a sire (father) and a dam (mother) who are studbook-approved individuals of whatever breed is racing. [ citation needed ] For example, in a normal harness race, the horse\\'s sire and dam must both be pure Standardbreds. The exception to this is in Quarter Horse racing, where an Appendix Quarter Horse may be considered eligible to race against (standard) Quarter Horses. The designation of \"Appendix\" refers to the addendum section, or Appendix, of the Official Quarter Horse registry. An Appendix Quarter Horse is a horse that has either one Quarter Horse parent and one parent of any other eligible breed (such as Thoroughbred, the most common Appendix cross), two parents that are registered Appendix Quarter Horses, or one parent that is a Quarter Horse and one parent that is an Appendix Quarter Horse. AQHA also issues a \"Racing Register of Merit\", which allows a horse to race on Quarter Horse tracks, but not be considered a Quarter Horse for breeding purposes (unless other requirements are met).  \\n\nA stallion who has won many races may be put up to stud when he is retired. Artificial insemination and embryo transfer technology (allowed only in some breeds) have brought changes to the traditions and ease of breeding.\\n\nPedigrees of stallions are recorded in various books and websites, such as Weatherbys Stallion Book , the Australian Stud Book and Thoroughbred Heritage . [ citation needed ] \\n\nThere are three founding sires that all Thoroughbreds can trace back to in the male line: the Darley Arabian , the Godolphin Arabian , and the Byerley Turk , named after their respective owners Thomas Darley , Lord Godolphin, and Captain Robert Byerly. They were taken to England, where they were bred with mares from English and imported bloodlines.  The resultant foals were the first generation of thoroughbreds, and all modern thoroughbreds are their descents. Thoroughbreds range in height, which is measured in hands (a hand being four inches). Some are as small as 15 hands while others are over 17. Thoroughbreds can travel medium distances at fast paces, requiring a balance between speed and endurance. Thoroughbreds may be bay , black , dark bay/brown, chestnut , gray , roan , white or palomino . Artificial insemination, cloning and embryo transfer are not allowed in the Thoroughbred breed.  \\n\nThe standardbred is a breed of horse used for a variety of purposes, but they are largely bred for harness racing. They are descended from thoroughbreds, morgans, and extinct breeds. Standardbreds are typically docile and easy to handle. They do not spook easily and are quite versatile in what they can do. They can be jumpers, dressage, and pleasure riding horses.  \\n\nThe Arabian horse was developed by the Bedouin people of the West Asia specifically for stamina over long distances, so they could outrun their enemies. It was not until 1725 that the first Arabians was brought to North America,  and not until about the time of the Civil War that they were bred as purebreds. Until the formation of the Arabian Horse Registry of America in 1908, Arabians were recorded with the Jockey Club in a separate subsection from Thoroughbreds.\\n\nArabians must be able to withstand traveling long distances at a moderate pace. They have an abundance of type I muscle fibers , enabling their muscles to work for extended periods of time. Also, the muscles of the Arabian are not nearly as massive as those of the Quarter Horse, which allow it to travel longer distances at quicker speeds. The Arabian is primarily used today in endurance racing but is also raced over traditional race tracks in many countries.\\n\nArabian Horse Racing is governed by the International Federation of Arabian Horse Racing.  \\n\nThe ancestors of the Quarter Horse were prevalent in America in the early 17th century. These horses were a blend of Colonial Spanish horses crossed with English horses that were brought over in the 1700s. The native horse and the English horse were bred together, resulting in a compact, muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The American Quarter Horse was not recognized as an official breed until the formation of the American Quarter Horse Association in 1940.  \\n\nIn order to be successful in racing, Quarter Horses need to be able to propel themselves forward at extremely fast sprinter speed. The Quarter Horse has much larger hind limb muscles than the Arabian, which make it less suitable for endurance racing.  It also has more type II-b muscle fibers, which allow the Quarter Horse to accelerate rapidly.\\n\nWhen Quarter Horse racing began, it was very expensive to lay a full mile of track so it was agreed that a straight track of four hundred meters, or one-quarter of a mile, would be laid instead.  It became the standard racing distance for Quarter Horses and inspired their name. With the exception of the longer, 870-yard (800 m) distance contests, Quarter Horse races are run flat out, with the horses running at top speed for the duration. There is less jockeying for position, as turns are rare, and many races end with several contestants grouped together at the wire. The track surface is similar to that of Thoroughbred racing and usually consists of dirt.\\n\nIn addition to the three main racing breeds above and their crosses, horse racing may be conducted using various other breeds: Appaloosa, American Paint Horse, Selle Fran\\xc3 7ais , AQPS  and Korean Jeju .  \\n\nMuscles are bundles of contractile fibers that are attached to bones by tendons. These bundles have different types of fibers within them, and horses have adapted over the years to produce different amounts of these fibers.   \\n\nType I muscle fibers are adapted for aerobic exercise and rely on the presence of oxygen. They are slow-twitch fibers. They allow muscles to work for longer periods of time resulting in greater endurance.\\n\nType II muscles are adapted for anaerobic exercise because they can function in the absence of oxygen.\\n\nType II-a fibers are intermediate, representing a balance between the fast-twitch fibers and the slow-twitch fibers. They allow the muscles to generate both speed and endurance. Thoroughbreds possess more Type II-a muscle fibers than Quarter Horses or Arabians. This type of fiber allows them to propel themselves forward at great speeds and maintain it for an extended distance.\\n\nType II-b fibers are fast-twitch fibers. These fibers allow muscles to contract quickly, resulting in a great deal of power and speed.\\n\nTraining\nThe conditioning program for the horses varies depending on the race length. Genetics, training, age, and skeletal soundness are all factors that contribute to a horse\\'s performance.  The muscle structure and fiber type of horses depends on the breed; therefore, genetics must be considered when constructing a conditioning plan. A horse\\'s fitness plan must be coordinated properly in order to prevent injury or lameness. If these are to occur, they may negatively affect a horse\\'s willingness to learn.  Sprinting exercises are appropriate for training two-year-old racehorses, but the number is limited by psychological factors as well as physical.  A horse\\'s skeletal system adapts to the exercise it receives. Because the skeletal system does not reach full maturity until the horse is at least six years of age, young racehorses often suffer injuries.  \\n\nHorse racing by continent\nIn the United States, Thoroughbred flat races are run on surfaces of either dirt, synthetic or turf. Other tracks offer Quarter Horse racing and Standardbred racing, on combinations of these three types of racing surfaces. Racing of other breeds, such as Arabian horse racing, is found on a limited basis. American Thoroughbred races are run at a wide variety of distances, most commonly from 5 to 12 furlongs (0.63 to 1.50 mi; 1.0 to 2.4 km); with this in mind, breeders of Thoroughbred race horses attempt to breed horses that excel at a particular distance (see dosage index ).\\n\nHorse racing in the United States and on the North American continent dates back to 1665, which saw the establishment of the Newmarket course in Salisbury, New York, a section of what is now known as the Hempstead Plains of Long Island , New York.  This first racing meet in North America was supervised by New York\\'s colonial governor, Richard Nicolls . The area is now occupied by the present Nassau County, New York , a region of Greater Westbury and East Garden City. The South Westbury section is still known as Salisbury.\\n\nThe first record of quarter-mile length races dated back to 1674 in Henrico County , Virginia . Each race consisted of only two horses, and they raced down the village streets and lanes. The Quarter Horse received its name from the length of the race.\\n\nTracing back the history of horse racing in the United States to its earliest inception in 1665, this sport has become an industry contributing approximately $15 billion to the U.S. economy today.  Horse racing has become the second most popular spectator sport in the United States with the establishment of historic tracks like Belmont Park, major events like the Kentucky Derby, and significant institutions such as the American Stud Book.\\n\nThe American Stud Book was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the United States. There were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890; and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed.  \\n\nThe Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack at the Alameda County Fairgrounds is the oldest remaining horse racing track in America,  dating from 1858, when it was founded by the sons of the Spaniard Don Agustín Bernal.\\n\nBelmont Park is located at the western edge of the Hempstead Plains. Its mile-and-a-half main track is the largest dirt Thoroughbred racecourse in the world, and it has the sport\\'s largest grandstand .\\n\nOne of the latest major horse tracks opened in the United States was the Meadowlands Racetrack , opened in 1977 for Thoroughbred and Harness racing. It is the home of the Meadowlands Cup . Other more recently opened tracks include Remington Park , Oklahoma City , opened in 1988, Sam Houston Race Park in the Houston metro area, opened in 1994, and Lone Star Park in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex , opened in 1997; the latter track hosted the prestigious Breeders\\' Cup series of races in 2004.\\n\nThoroughbred horse racing in the United States has its own Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York . The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers.\\n\nThe traditional high point of US horse racing is the Kentucky Derby , held on the first Saturday of May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky . Together, the Derby; the Preakness Stakes , held two weeks later at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore , Maryland; and the Belmont Stakes , held three weeks after the Preakness at Belmont Park on Long Island, form the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing for three-year-olds. They are all held early in the year, throughout May and the beginning of June. In recent years the Breeders\\' Cup races, run at the end of the year, have challenged the Triple Crown events as determiners of the three-year-old champion. The Breeders\\' Cup is normally held at a different track every year; however, the 2010 and 2011 editions were both held at Churchill Downs, and 2012, 2013 and 2014 races were held at Santa Anita Park . Keeneland , in Lexington, Kentucky, hosted the 2015 Breeders\\' Cup.\\n\nThe corresponding Standardbred event is the Breeders Crown . There is also a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers and a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters .\\n\nAmerican betting on horse racing is sanctioned and regulated by the state where the race is located.  Simulcast betting exists across state lines with minimal oversight except the companies involved through legalized parimutuel gambling . A takeout, or \"take\", is removed from each betting pool and distributed according to state law, among the state, race track and horsemen. A variety of factors affect takeout, namely location and the type of wager that is placed.  One form of parimutuel gaming is Instant Racing , in which players bet on video replays of races.\\n\nAdvanced Deposit Wagering is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a cut of ADW revenues.\\n\nThe most famous horse from Canada is generally considered to be Northern Dancer , who after winning the Kentucky Derby , Preakness and Queen\\'s Plate in 1964 went on to become the most successful Thoroughbred sire of the twentieth century; his two-minute-flat Derby was the fastest on record until Secretariat in 1973. The only challenger to his title of greatest Canadian horse would be his son Nijinsky II , who is the last horse to win the English Triple Crown . Woodbine Racetrack (1956) in Toronto is home of the Queen\\'s Plate (1860), Canada\\'s premier Thoroughbred stakes race, and the North America Cup (1984), Canada\\'s premier Standardbred stakes race. It is the only race track in North America which stages Thoroughbred and Standardbred (harness) meetings on the same day. The Canadian International and Woodbine Mile (1981) are Canada\\'s most important Grade I races worth Can$ 1,000,000 each, and have been won by many renowned horses such as Secretariat and Wise Dan respectively. Other key races include Woodbine Oaks (1956), Prince of Wales Stakes (1929), Breeders\\' Stakes (1889) and Canadian Derby (1930).\\n\nHorse racing in Belgium takes place at three venues - Hippodrome Wellington in Ostend (opened in 1883 in honour of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington ), Hippodroom Waregem in Waregem in Flanders and Hippodrome de Wallonie in Mons , Wallonia .\\n\nThere are 15 racecourses in the Czech Republic, most notably Pardubice Racecourse, where the country\\'s most famous race, the Velka Pardubicka steeplechase , has been run since 1874.  However, the first official race was organized back in 1816 by Emperor Francis II near Kladruby nad Labem . The Czech horse racing season usually starts at the beginning of April and ends sometime in November. Racing takes place mostly at weekends and there is usually one meeting on a Saturday and one on Sunday.  Horse races, as well as Thoroughbred horse breeding, is organized by Jockey Club Czech Republic, founded in 1919.  \\n\nFrance has a major horse racing industry. It is home to the famous Prix de l\\'Arc de Triomphe held at Longchamp Racecourse , the richest race in Europe and the third richest turf race in the world after the Japan Cup and the Everest with a prize of 4  million Euros (approximately US$4.2  million). Other major races include the Grand Prix de Paris , the Prix du Jockey Club (the French Derby ) and the Prix de Diane . Besides Longchamp, France\\'s other premier flat racecourses include Chantilly and Deauville . There is also a smaller but nevertheless important jumps racing sector, with Auteil Racecourse being the best known. The sport\\'s governing body is France Galop .\\n\nHorse racing in Great Britain is predominantly thoroughbred flat and jumps racing. It was in Great Britain in the 17th to 19th centuries that many of the sport\\'s rules and regulations were established. Named after Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby , The Derby was first run in 1780. The race serves as the middle leg of the British Triple Crown , preceded by the 2000 Guineas and followed by the St Leger . The name \" Derby \" has since become synonymous with great races all over the world, and as such has been borrowed many times in races abroad.  \\n\nThe Grand National is the most prominent race in British culture , watched by many people who do not normally watch or bet on horse racing at other times of the year.  Many of the sport\\'s greatest jockeys, most notably Sir Gordon Richards , have been British. The sport is regulated by the British Horseracing Authority . The BHA\\'s authority does not extend to Northern Ireland; racing in Ireland is governed on an All-Ireland basis.\\n\nDespite having an ancient tradition with well-documented history, all racetracks in Greece have ceased operation due to the Greek government-debt crisis .  \\n\nHungary has a long-standing horse racing tradition. The first horse racing in Pest was noted on June 6, 1827. [ citation needed ] Although racing in Hungary is neither as popular nor as prestigious as it is in Western Europe, the country is notable for producing some fine international racehorses. Foremost of these is Kincsem , foaled in 1874 and the most successful Thoroughbred racehorse ever, having won 54 races in 54 starts. The country also produced Overdose , a horse who won his first 12 races, including group races in Germany and Italy, and finished fourth in the King\\'s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot .\\n\nIreland has a rich history of horse racing; point to pointing originated there, and even today, jump racing is more popular than racing on the flat. As a result, every year Irish horse racing fans travel in huge numbers to the highlight event of the National Hunt calendar, the Cheltenham Festival , and in recent years Irish owned or bred horses have dominated the event. [ citation needed ] Ireland has a thriving Thoroughbred breeding industry, stimulated by favorable tax treatment. [ citation needed ] The world\\'s largest Thoroughbred stud farm, Coolmore Stud , has its main site there (in addition to major operations in the U.S. and Australia).\\n\nIn recent years, [ when? ] various Irish bred and trained horses achieved victory in one or more of the British 2000 Guineas , The Derby and the Prix de l\\'Arc de Triomphe , considered the three most prestigious races in Europe. In the six runnings of the Epsom Derby between 2008 and 2013, Irish horses filled 20 of the first 30 placings, winning the race 5 times. [ citation needed ] \\n\nHistorically, Italy has been one of the leading European horse-racing nations, albeit in some respects behind Great Britain, Ireland, and France in size and prestige. The late Italian horse breeder Federico Tesio was particularly notable. In recent years, however, the sport in the country has suffered a major funding crisis, culminating in its 2014 expulsion from the European Pattern .  \\n\nIn Wassenaar in the Hague there is a grass course at Duindigt .\\n\nHorse racing in Poland can be dated to 1777, when a horse owned by Polish noble Kazimierz Rzewuski beat the horse of the English chargé d\\'affaires , Sir Charles Whitworth , on the road from Wola to Ujazdów Castle . The first regular horse racing was organized in 1841 on Mokotów Fields in Warsaw by Towarzystwo Wy\\xc5\\x9bcigów Konnych i Wystawy Zwierz\\xc4\\x85t Gospodarskich w Królestwie Polskim (in English, the Society of Horse Racing in Congress Poland). The main racetrack in Poland is Warsaw\\'s S\\xc5\\x82u\\xc5\\xbcewiec Racecourse. The industry was severely limited during the Communist era, when gambling, the major source of funding, was made illegal.\\n\nHarness racing (also known as trotting), is a popular sport in Sweden, with significant amounts of money wagered annually.\\n\nHorse racing in Australia was founded during the early years of settlement and the industry has grown to be among the top three leading Thoroughbred racing nations of the world.  The world-famous Melbourne Cup , the race that stops a nation , has recently attracted many international entries. In country racing, records indicate that Goulburn commenced racing in 1834.  Australia\\'s first country racing club was established at Wallabadah in 1852 and the Wallabadah Cup is still held on New Year\\'s Day (the current racecourse was built in 1898).  \\n\nIn Australia, the most famous racehorse was Phar Lap (bred in New Zealand), who raced from 1928 to 1932. Phar Lap carried 9 st 12 lb (62.5 kg) to win the 1930 Melbourne Cup. Australian steeplechaser Crisp is remembered for his battle with Irish champion Red Rum in the 1973 Grand National . In 2003-2005 the mare Makybe Diva (bred in Great Britain) became the only racehorse to ever win the Melbourne Cup three times, let alone in consecutive years. Still more recently, another mare, Winx . won the prestigious Cox Plate four straight times, and set a modern-era world record for most consecutive race wins by a Thoroughbred, winning the last 33 races of her career. In harness racing , Cane Smoke had 120 wins, including 34 in a single season, Paleface Adios became a household name during the 1970s, while Cardigan Bay , a pacing horse from New Zealand, enjoyed great success at the highest levels of American harness racing in the 1960s. More recently, Blacks A Fake has won four Inter Dominion Championships, making him the only horse to complete this feat in Australasia\\'s premier harness race.  \\n\nCompetitive endurance riding commenced in Australia in 1966, when the Tom Quilty Gold Cup was first held in the Hawkesbury district, near Sydney. The Quilty Cup is considered the National endurance ride and there are now over 100 endurance events contested across Australia, ranging in distances from 80 km to 400 km.  The world\\'s longest endurance ride is the Shahzada 400 km Memorial Test which is conducted over five days traveling 80 kilometers a day at St Albans on the Hawkesbury River , New South Wales . In all endurance events, there are rigorous vet checks, conducted before, during and after the competition, in which the horses\\' welfare is of the utmost concern.  \\n\nRacing is a long-established sport in New Zealand, stretching back to colonial times.\\n\nHorse racing is a significant part of the New Zealand economy which in 2004 generated 1.3% of the GDP. The indirect impact of expenditures on racing was estimated to have generated more than $1.4 billion in economic activity in 2004 and created 18,300 full-time equivalent jobs. More than 40,000 people were involved in some capacity in the New Zealand racing industry in 2004. In 2004, more than one million people attended race meetings in New Zealand.  There are 69 Thoroughbred and 51 harness clubs licensed in New Zealand. Racecourses are situated in 59 locations throughout New Zealand.\\n\nThe bloodstock industry is important to New Zealand, with the export sale of horses - mainly to Australia and Asia - generating more than $120 million a year. During the 2008-09 racing season 19 New Zealand bred horses won 22 Group One races around the world.  \\n\nNotable thoroughbred racehorses from New Zealand include Carbine , Nightmarch , Sunline , Desert Gold and Rising Fast .   Phar Lap and Tulloch were both bred in New Zealand but did not race there.\\n\nThe most famous New Zealand standardbred horse is probably Cardigan Bay. Stanley Dancer drove the New Zealand bred horse, Cardigan Bay to win $1 million in stakes in 1968, the first harness horse to surpass that milestone in American history .  Other horses of note include Young Quinn , Christian Cullen , Lazarus and the trotter Lyell Creek .\\n\nOn 25 June 1812, the Champ de Mars Racecourse was inaugurated by The Mauritius Turf Club which was founded earlier in the same year by Colonel Edward A. Draper . The Champ de Mars is situated on a prestigious avenue in Port Louis , the capital city and is the oldest racecourse in the southern hemisphere . The Mauritius Turf Club is the second oldest active turf club in the world.\\n\nUndeniably, racing is one of the most popular sports in Mauritius now attracting regular crowds of 20,000 people or more to the only racecourse of the island.\\n\nA high level of professionalism has been attained in the organization of races over the last decades preserving the unique electrifying ambiance prevailing on race days at the Champ de Mars.\\n\nMembers of the British royal family , such as Queen Elizabeth II , Princess Margaret or Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother have attended or patronized races at the Champ de Mars numerous times.\\n\nChamp de Mars has four classic events a year such as the Duchess of York Cup, the Barbé Cup, the Maiden Cup, and the Duke of York Cup.\\n\nMost of the horses are imported from South Africa but some are also acquired from Australia, the United Kingdom and France.         \\n\nHorse racing is a popular sport in South Africa that can be traced back to 1797. The first recorded race club meeting took place five years later in 1802.  The national horse racing body is known as the National Horseracing Authority and was founded in 1882. The premier event, which attracts 50,000 people to Durban, is the Durban July Handicap , which has been run since 1897 at Greyville Racecourse . It is the largest and most prestigious event on the continent, with betting running into the hundreds of millions of Rands. Several July winners have gone on to win major international races, such as Colorado King, London News, and Ipi Tombe.  However, the other notable major races are the Summer Cup, held at Turffontein Racecourse in Johannesburg , and The Sun Met, which is held at Kenilworth race track in Cape Town .\\n\nHorse racing in one form or another has been a part of Chinese culture for millennia. Horse racing was a popular pastime for the aristocracy at least by the Zhou dynasty - 4th century B.C. General Tian Ji \\'s stratagem for a horse race remains perhaps the best-known story about horse racing in that period. In the 18th and 19th centuries, horse racing and equestrian sports in China was dominated by Mongol influences.\\n\nThoroughbred horse racing came to China with British settlements in the middle 1800s and most notably centered around the treaty ports, including the two major race courses in Shanghai, the Shanghai Racecourse and the International Recreation Grounds (in Kiang-wan), and the racecourses of Tianjin . The Kiang-wan racecourse was destroyed in the lead-up to the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Shanghai Race Club closed in 1954. The former Shanghai Racecourse is now People\\'s Square and People\\'s Park and the former club building was the Shanghai Art Museum .\\n\nAs Hong Kong and Macau are Special Administrative Region , they\\'re allowed to exemption from ban of gambling on mainland China. (See below)\\n\nHorse racing was banned in the Republic of China from 1945, and the People\\'s Republic of China maintained the ban after 1949, although allowances were made for ethnic minority peoples for whom horse sports are a cultural tradition. Speed horse racing (\\xe9\\x80\\x9f\\xe5\\xba 6\\xe8\\xb5\\x9b\\xe9 9 c) was an event in the National Games of China , mainly introduced to cater to minority peoples, such as the Mongols . The racecourse was initially 5 km, but from 2005 (the 10th National Games) was extended to 12 km. The longer race led to deaths and injuries to participating horses in both 2005 and the 11th National Games in 2009. Also, with the entry into the sport of Han majority provinces such as Hubei , which are better funded and used Western, rather than traditional, breeding and training techniques, meant that the original purpose of the event to foster traditional horse racing for groups like the Mongols was at risk of being usurped. At the 2009 National Games, Hubei won both the gold and silver medals, with Inner Mongolia winning bronze. As a result of these factors, the event was abolished for the 12th National Games in 2013.\\n\nClub horse racing reappeared on a small scale in the 1990s. In 2008, the China Speed Horse Race Open in Wuhan was organized as the qualification round for the speed horse race event at the National Games the next year, but was also seen by commentators as a step towards legalizing both horse racing and gambling on the races.  The Wuhan Racecourse was the only racecourse that organized races in China.  In 2014, the Wuhan Jockey Club organized more than 80 races. Almost all Chinese trainers and jockeys stabled in Wuhan. However, with the demise of the event at the National Games and the government not relenting from the ban on commercial racing, various racecourses built in recent years are all in a state of disuse: The Nanjing Racecourse, which previously hosted National Games equestrian events, is now used as a car park;  the Beijing Jockey Club was shut down in 2008. The racecourse in Inner Mongolia has not been active since 2012.\\n\nHorse racing eventually returned to mainland China on the year 2014 as the one-day, five-card event for foreign horses, trainers and jockeys.  Standardized horse racing events have gradually emerged in China.  \\n\nThe British tradition of horse racing left its mark with the creation of one of the most important entertainment and gambling institutions in Hong Kong. Established as the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club in 1884, the non-profit organization conducts nearly 700 races every season at the two race tracks: in Happy Valley and Sha Tin .\\n\nAll horses are imported since there is no breeding operation. [ citation needed ] The sport annually draws millions of dollars of tax revenue. Off-track betting is available from overseas bookmakers.\\n\nIn the 1920s, the Hong Kong Jockey Club had race meetings for visitors already. Visitors were divided into public and member. The charges for these two types of visitors are different.\\n\nThe charge for admission to the Public Enclosure is $1 per day for all while soldiers and sailors can enjoy half price. On the other hand, members are required to show their badges to obtain admission to the Members\\' Enclosure. And also the charge for admission to the Members\\' Enclosure is $2 per day.  By comparing the lowest wage in 1929, we observe that the lowest wage is around $12 ( $0.4 per day) which has a large distance for the requirement enclosure.  Therefore, we can observe that the race meetings are mainly opened for upper class mostly while grass-root has a lower chance to touch horse racing activity.\\n\nNowadays, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is a cornerstone of modern Hong Kong. It donates all its profits to the Hong Kong government, charities and public institutions. It is the territory\\'s largest taxpayer, contributing 11% of the government\\'s revenues in 2000. In economic terms, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is an old-fashioned government-protected monopoly; all other forms of gambling are illegal in this industry.  \\n\nSweepstakes were introduced in Hong Kong during the 1920s. There are three types of sweepstakes which are the Special Cash Sweeps, the Last Race Sweep and the Ordinary Cash Sweeps. Special Cash Sweeps were at first drawn twice a year, and increased to three times a year later given its popularity. It carried the highest prize money amongst three types of sweepstakes. The Last Race Sweep commanded higher prize money then Ordinary Cash Sweeps, which were drawn for almost every race and therefore carried the lowest prize money.  \\n\nSweepstakes could be purchased either at sweepstakes stations or from sweepstakes vendors throughout Hong Kong. With different numbers print on each sweepstake, one sweepstake is drawn and assigned, for each horse participating in the race, and the sweepstake attached to the winning horse would win the first prize. Likewise, the number of the first runner-up and second runner-up would win the second and third prize, respectively, with the rest winning consolation prizes. With the introduction of new bet types in horse racing and the launch of the Mark Six lottery in the 1970s, the club finally stopped selling sweepstakes in 1977.  \\n\nJockey Club of Macau was established for harness racing. It started to conduct horse races in 1989.  \\n\nIndia\\'s first racecourse was set up in Madras in 1777, Guindy race course . Today India has nine racetracks operated by seven racing authorities. [ citation needed ] \\n\nJapan has two governing bodies that control its horseracing - the Japan Racing Association (JRA), and National Association of Racing (NAR). Between them they conduct more than 21,000 horse races a year. The JRA is responsible for horseracing events at ten major racecourses in metropolitan areas, while the NAR is responsible for various local horseracing events throughout Japan. Racing in Japan is mainly flat racing , but Japan also has jump racing and a sled-pulling race known as Ban\\'ei (also called Draft Racing).\\n\nJapan\\'s top stakes races are run in the spring, autumn, and winter. These include the country\\'s most prominent race - the Grade 1 Japan Cup , a 2,400 m (about 1\\xc2\\xbd mile) invitational turf race run every November at Tokyo Racecourse for a purse of \\xc2 5476  million (about US$5.6 million), one of the richest turf races in the world. Other noted stakes races include the February Stakes , Japanese Derby , Takamatsunomiya Kinen , Yasuda Kinen , Takarazuka Kinen , Arima Kinen , Satsuki Sho , Kikka Sho , and the Tenno Sho races run in the spring and fall. Japan\\'s top jump race is the Nakayama Grand Jump , run every April at Nakayama Racecourse .\\n\nIn Malaysia , horse racing was introduced during the British colonial era and remains to the present day as a gambling activity. There are three race courses in Peninsular Malaysia, namely Penang Turf Club , Perak Turf Club, and Selangor Turf Club . Within and only within the turf clubs, betting on horse racing is a legal form of gambling. Racing in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore is conducted and governed under the Rules of the Malayan Racing Association and betting in Malaysia is operated and organized by Pan Malaysian Pools Sdn Bhd. In East Malaysia, races are governed independently by the Royal Sabah Turf Club  and the Sarawak Turf Club.  \\n\nMongolian horse racing takes place during the Naadam festival. Mongolia does not have Thoroughbred horse racing. Rather, it has its own Mongolian style of horse racing in which the horses run for at least a distance of 25 kilometers.  \\n\nHorse races are held in Pakistan at four clubs. In Lahore at Lahore Race Club , Rawalpindi at Chakri, in Karachi at Karachi Race Club , and in Gujrat at Gujrat Race Club.\\n\nHorseracing in the Philippines began in 1867. The history of Philippine horseracing has three divisions according to the breeds of horses used. They are the Philippine-pony era (1867-1898), the Arabian-horse era (1898-1930), and the Thoroughbred-era (1935-present).  \\n\nHorse racing was introduced to Singapore by the British during the colonial era and remained one of the legal forms of gambling after independence. It remains a highly popular form of entertainment with the local Singaporean community to this day. Races are typically held on Friday evenings and Sundays at the Singapore Turf Club in Kranji . Horse racing has also left its mark in the naming of roads in Singapore such as Race Course Road in Little India , where horse racing was first held in Singapore, and Turf Club Road in Bukit Timah where Singapore Turf Club used to be situated before moving to its current location in 1999. [ citation needed ] \\n\nHorse racing in South Korea dates back to May 1898, when a foreign language institute run by the government included a donkey race in its athletic rally. However, it wasn\\'t until the 1920s that modern horse racing involving betting developed. The nation\\'s first authorised club, the Chosun Racing Club, was established in 1922 and a year later, the pari-mutuel betting system was officially adopted for the first time.  \\n\nThe Korean War disrupted the development of horse racing in the country, but after the Seoul Olympics in 1988, the Olympic Equestrian Park was converted into racing facilities named Seoul Race Park , which helped the sport to develop again.  \\n\nHorses have been an important role in Turks\\' lives throughout history. After the modern Republic Of Turkey was established in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the number of breeding and racing Arabian and thoroughbred racehorses accelerated rapidly, especially after the beginning of the 1930s. The Jockey Club of Turkey, founded in 1950, was the turning point of both the Turkish breeding and racing industries.\\n\nThe big race in the UAE is the Dubai World Cup , a race with a purse of US$12 million, which was the largest purse in the world until being surpassed by the Saudi Cup , a race in Riyadh with a $20  million purse that held its first edition in 2020.  Other races include the Dubai Kahayla Classic with a purse of US$250,000.\\n\nThe Meydan Racecourse in Dubai, reportedly the world\\'s largest race track, opened on March 27, 2010, for the Dubai World Cup race. The race track complex contains two tracks with seating for 60,000, a hotel, restaurants, theater and a museum.\\n\nThere is no parimutuel betting in the UAE as gambling is illegal.  \\n\nIn Argentina the sport is known as turf. Some of the most famous racers are Irineo Leguisamo , Vilmar Sanguinetti, Marina Lezcano, Jorge Valdivieso, Pablo Falero and Jorge Ricardo. The most notable Argentine horse of recent decades is Invasor , who won Uruguay\\'s Triple Crown in 2005; won four U.S. Grade I races in 2006, including the Breeders\\' Cup Classic , on his way to being named that country\\'s Horse of the Year ; and ended his racing career in 2007 with two more Grade I/Group One wins, including the Dubai World Cup.\\n\nCarlos Gardel\\'s tango Por una cabeza is about horse racing, a sport of which he was a known fan. Gardel was a good friend of Irineo Leguisamo , who is the most recognized Uruguayan jockey, who raced numerous years in Argentine. [ citation needed ] \\n\nBetting\nAt many horse races, there is a gambling station, where gamblers can stake money on a horse . Gambling on horses is prohibited at some tracks; Springdale Race Course, home of the nationally renowned TD Bank Carolina Cup and Colonial Cup Steeplechase in Camden, South Carolina , is known as one of the tracks where betting is illegal, due to a 1951 law. Where gambling is allowed, most tracks offer parimutuel betting where gamblers\\' money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction is made from the pool. In some countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Australia, an alternative and more popular facility is provided by bookmakers who effectively make a market in odds. This allows the gambler to \\'lock in\\' odds on a horse at a particular time (known as \\'taking the price\\' in the UK). Parimutuel gambling on races also provides not only purse money to participants but considerable tax revenue, with over $100 billion wagered annually in 53 countries.  \\n\nDeaths and injuries\nAnna Waller, a member of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of North Carolina, co-authored a four-year-long study of jockey injuries and stated to The New York Times that \"For every 1,000 jockeys you have riding [for one year], over 600 will have medically treated injuries.\" She added that almost 20% of these were serious head or neck injuries. The study reported 6,545 injuries during the years 1993-1996.   More than 100 jockeys were killed in the United States between 1950 and 1987.  \\n\nHorses also face dangers in racing. 1.5 horses die out of every 1,000 starts in the United States.  The U.S. Jockey Club in New York estimates that about 600 horses died at racetracks in 2006. The Jockey Club in Hong Kong reported a far lower figure of 0.58 horses per 1,000 starts. There is speculation that drugs used in horse racing in the United States, which are banned elsewhere, are responsible for the higher death rate in the United States.  \\n\nIn the Canadian province of Ontario , a study of 1,709 racehorse deaths between 2003 and 2015 found that the majority of deaths were attributable to \"damage during exercise to the horses\\' musculoskeletal system \", including fractures, dislocations, and tendon ruptures.  Mortality rates were eight times higher for thoroughbreds than standardbreds , and highest amongst young horses. The study also found that the incidence of off-track deaths was twice as high for thoroughbreds.\\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 186 horses were killed as a direct result of racing in 2019. Of these 145 died in National Hunt (jump) racing and 41 in flat racing.  A report published in 2005 estimated that \"around 375 horses who are entered into races each season die from their injuries, or they are killed because they are considered of no further commercial value, even though they are young enough to continue racing.\" It added, \"Reasons for horses being destroyed include broken legs, back, neck and pelvis; fatal spinal injuries, exhaustion, heart attack, and burst blood vessels in the lungs.\"  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nHotel El Convento\nHotel El Convento is a small hotel in Old San Juan , Puerto Rico , in what was a Carmelite convent, adjoining the San Juan Cathedral square. The cathedral is the second-oldest cathedral in the Western Hemisphere . Hotel El Convento is the oldest member of the Historic Hotels of America . It was also named the premier Small Luxury Hotel in Puerto Rico by the Small Luxury Hotels of the World organization.\\n\nHistory\nIn 1646, construction began on the Carmelite convent,  through a petition by King Philip IV of Spain . The Monasterio del Señor San José de la Orden de nuestra Señora del Carmen (Monastery of Our Lady Carmen of San Jose) was founded in 1651 by Doña Ana Lanzós, a wealthy widow who donated her money and her magnificent residence (a large double sloped tiled roof) in the street that since then bears her name: de las Monjas. Historian María de los \\xc3\\x81ngeles Castro tells us that the delay in the arrival of a nunnery was due to economic reasons but also for lack of defense since the fortifications of the city were not yet complete. Three nuns brought especially from Santo Domingo served as founders.\\n\nThe building was expanded between 1854 and 1861 after the original building was torn down. Governor Fernándo Norzagaray y Escudero personally helped to raise the necessary funds and inspected the work daily. Certain elements stand out in the facade of the chapel, beside the entrance, the pair of Tuscan columns, the two towers and the latticed choir arch. The frieze above the door is interrupted for a legend that never was placed. The building was closed from 1903 to 1959 and then sold. During its conversion to a hotel the two towers were removed as was the cross that identified the site as a convent.\\n\nIn 1959, under the auspices of Operation Bootstrap , Robert Woolworth started the renovation to turn it into the El Convento Hotel. It reopened in 1962 to the stars of the day, including Rita Hayworth , offering a tranquil, European-style alternative to the glitzy hotels lining the Condado strip.\\n\nIn the 1990s, El Convento underwent a $14 million renovation  by a team led by Hugh Andrews and Jorge Rosselló, who also remodeled other hotels such as La Concha , and the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel . It was rechristened as Hotel El Convento, a 4-star small luxury hotel with five stories, a central courtyard where a 300-year old Níspero fruit tree still stands, a pool and Jacuzzi on the fourth-floor terrace, and great views of Old San Juan, maintaining the same high standard of luxury and style. Other notable present-day features of this boutique-style hotel include a 24-hour fitness center, a daily manager\\'s wine and cheese reception, Patio del Níspero open-air restaurant,  24-hour hospitality bar, five versatile meeting rooms, library, business center, herb garden, a beach club featuring beach privileges in Condado and Isla Verde beaches, and more.\\n\nIn 2005, it was described as \"an elegant 55-room inn in a former Carmelite convent .\"  \\n\nHotel El Convento is an Old San Juan institution with more than 365 years of tradition, making it the oldest member of the Historic Hotels of America . It was also named the premier Small Luxury Hotel in Puerto Rico by the Small Luxury Hotels of the World organization.\\n\nNotables guests\nSome of the hotel\\'s notable guests over the years include:   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nHotel Meliá\n\\n\nHotel Meliá is a historic  colonial style  family owned and operated hotel located in the Ponce Historic Zone in Ponce, Puerto Rico . It is the oldest continuously operating hotel in Puerto Rico .   Hotel Meliá, which was founded over 60 years before the much larger Meliá Hotels International chain opened its first lodging facility, bears no relation to the multi-hotel chain headquartered in Spain .   \\n\nLocation\nThe colonial facade of Hotel Meliá is located across from Parque de Bombas in Plaza Las Delicias , in downtown Ponce.  \\n\nDesign\nThe hotel lobby, with its polished wood paneling, plush seating and marble floors is traditional of the hotel\\'s long-recognized throwback elegance.  The hotel has been called \"reminiscent of Old World Spain\\'.\"  Hotel Meliá Ponce\\'s design was inspired by a small hotel in Barcelona, Spain . The tile on the second floor is similar to what is oftentimes seen in an Old World Spanish hotel. \"The feeling of Europe is evident also in the layout of the property as one level up from the lobby there is an open air area...the architecture is a \"unique mix of cultures with the Spanish influence reinvented\".  \\n\nHistory\nIn 1890, Bartolo Meliá moved from Mallorca, Spain to Ponce to take an accounting job. Once he arrived to Puerto Rico, Meliá discovered that the owners of the business he was to take a job at were in jail. Not discouraged, he settled in Ponce and opened a small grocery store across Plaza Las Delicias . Meliá imported many goods from Europe which established his reputation as a popular grocer in the city. Thanks to his success as a grocer, he expanded his store into a restaurant. Seeing the need for an overnight stay of drivers making their trips from San Juan to Ponce and the convenient location of his grocery-restaurant, he then expanded into a small hotel.  \\n\nBartolo Meliá founded the Meliá in 1895.   It was originally a 2-story structure but was later converted into a four-story building as the hotel business expanded.  From very early times the hotel became well known for its attention to personal details, cleanliness, hospitality, service and courtesy. It quickly became a preferred destination for Ponce business travelers. \"Mr. Meliá is a prince of hosts, and a man who never grudges at going out of his way to oblige a guest.\"  \\n\nMeliá was the first hotel in Puerto Rico to offer a telephone line and a private bathroom in each room.   As the business grew, so did the hotel. It saw major expansions in 1915, 1940 and 1960. The original hotel faced Plaza Las Delicias , but in 1915 Alfredo Wiechers Pieretti redesigned it to have its entrance on Calle Cristina, increasing the number of its rooms from nine to 21. In 1940, Francisco Porrata Doria added 26 new rooms bringing the total number of rooms to 47. In 1960, 26 additional rooms yet were added by Enrique Soler Cloquell   bringing the total to the actual number of 73 rooms.   \\n\nManagement\nSince 1895, the hotel had been in the Melia family for four generations, doing business under the corporate name Hotel Melia, Inc., but in July 2013, the hotel was bought by Prime Holdings Group, a Ponce investment group headed by Abel Misla, the dean of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Puerto Rico School of Architecture . The new owners plan to redesign the hotel to give it a more 19th-century Spanish-themed , boutique hotel .  \\n\nTrademark dispute\nIn late 2008, Hotel Melia Inc (HMI) filed a complaint against Sol Meliá in the Court of First Instance after the Spanish company attempted to register the name \"Melia\" with the Puerto Rico Department of State asserting that Hotel Melia Inc \"had the sole right to use the Meliá mark in connection with hotel and restaurant services throughout Puerto Rico.\"  As a result, Sol Melia withdrew its application. But S.L. Dorpan, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sol Meliá, subsequently filed a complaint against HMI in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico , \"seeking a declaration that under the Lanham Act, Dorpan had the right to use the mark Meliá throughout Puerto Rico\" and that HMI had the right to use the name Melia only in the city of Ponce. The District Court then ruled in favor of Sol Melia.  HMI then appealed the decision of the US District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. On 28 August 2013, the Court of Appeals issued its opinion vacating the lower district court\\'s decision and ruling in favor of Ponce\\'s HMI.  \\n\nGuests\nSeveral prominent figures have been guests at the Melia, including Libertad Lamarque , María Antonieta Pons , Yolanda \"Tongolele\" Montes and Ninón Sevilla ,  as well as Pedro Albizu Campos .  U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was also a guest at this hotel. So were Ann and Gene Gillam.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nHotel Ponce Intercontinental\n\\n\nThe Hotel Ponce Intercontinental (also known as \"El Ponce\" ) is an abandoned hotel with a still existing structure at Cerro del Vigía in Ponce, Puerto Rico . The structure is considered a historic landmark and a national icon in the city of Ponce and Puerto Rico .  The property is currently owned by Misla Hospitality Group, a family of local Ponce investors who bought it from CBC Development. Its architecture is classical modern .  When it opened, in 1960, it became the first modern hotel in the city.  \\n\nLocation and features\nThe hotel is located in the northern section of the city of Ponce, on a hill just north of the El Vigia Hill , behind Cruceta del Vigía and Castillo Serralles .  The hotel had a large circular outdoor swimming pool, a ballroom named Salón Ponciana , a cocktail bar named Bar Coquí ; and a restaurant called El Cafetal .  The hotel also had a casino that operated until 1973.  On the top of the hotel, WRIK-TV had its transmission antenna.  The hotel is on a lot measuring approximately 25 cuerdas (roughly 25 acres).  The land area is 22.5 cuerdas .  \\n\nDesign\nThe hotel was designed in 1957-58 by American architect William B. Tabler , FAIA .  Tabler, whose offices were in New York City , designed hotels worldwide for the Statler chain, Hilton, and Intercontinental.   \\n\nTabler designed the Ponce Intercontinental in a modern style with ample space for cross ventilation and light, interior details, and quasi-futuristic traits. The design takes advantage of the location of the building for natural ventilation and exposure to large and spacious panoramic views of the Caribbean Sea from the top sector of the El Vigia Hill in the municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico.  \\n\nThe architectural design of this hotel is simple but consistent with a curvilinear theme which is unique in Puerto Rico. The concrete shells that housed the restaurant, and activities rooms are geared to take advantage of large open spaces with majestic views of the Caribbean Sea.  The use of ornamental roofs is typical of modern architecture of the mid-1950s era.  \\n\nHistory\nThe first stone of the Hotel was placed on January 6, 1958, under the project name \"Hotel El Ponceño\",   and the Hotel opened as a luxury hotel on 1 February 1960.   The cost of the construction of the hotel was $3.75 million USD ($40 million today).  The Hotel operated for 15 years (from 1960 to 1975) and was of particular importance in the collective memory of the Ponce\\'s popular society in the 1960s through the 1970s.  The hotel was a bustling center of entertainment that stood out as a center of large musical events of those years. The Ponce Intercontinental is remembered for being the birthplace of great artistic, social and political events of its time.  Celebrities, such as Chucho Avellanet , Iris Chacon , El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico , Celia Cruz , Marco Antonio Muñiz , José José , Sandro de America , Camilo Sesto , Raphael , and others, stayed or performed at the hotel.  \\n\nClosing\nThe hotel\\'s definitive closure was first announced on April 21, 1975, slated for May 30, due to the hotel\\'s profound economical crisis as losses were accumulating over $1.7 millions ($10 millions today).  The hotel\\'s management were disposed to accept offers to avoid the hotel\\'s closure, requiring $1 million ($6 millions today) investment.  A group of local Ponce investors were interested in leasing the hotel to continue operating, once Inter\\xc2\\xb7Continental Hotels ceases operations.  \\n\nHowever, the interested group didn\\'t have the necessary economical resources to continue operating the hotel, and the hotel was finally closed on May 31, 1975 at 11 pm, a day after the anticipated date, losing over 145 jobs. 7 guests were staying at the hotel on the last day of operations.   After the hotel\\'s closure, Inter\\xc2\\xb7Continental Hotels continued in charge of the building\\'s maintenance until 1980.  \\n\nThe hotel\\'s location, high costs, labor conflicts, and the lack of appropriated road access were considered factors for the hotel\\'s economical problems that caused the closure.      The hotel\\'s only access road was through a narrow one-way, one-lane alley in a financially deprived neighborhood north of the city. The lack of touristic promotion outside San Juan Metropolitan Area and the hotel\\'s bad administration were also blamed for the hotel\\'s failure.  \\n\nRe-construction\nIn 1979, the mayor of Ponce José G. Tormos Vega announced that the hotel would reopen under new owners for the 1979 Pan American Games , which was held in San Juan, Puerto Rico . However, the hotel didn't reopen and in 1981, a group of Puerto Rican and American investors were reportedly looking into purchasing the property. No other developments were subsequently reported.  \\n\nIn 1985, and under Government of Puerto Rico guidelines, Puerto Rico\\'s Compañia de Fomento Industrial ( \"PRIDCO\" ) decided to buy the structure on 7 November 1985, with the goal of remodeling it, expanding its facilities, and providing the city of Ponce with world-class accommodations. PRIDCO commissioned the architectural firm of Pablo Quinones & Associates to initiate investigations and studies on the condition of the main structure with the intention of upgrading it to modern codes. The design team generated its recommendations, which were delivered to the PRIDCO. Simultaneously, the team traveled to New York City in 1985-86, where it located the original plans at the offices of William B. Tabler . As a design strategy for its architectural features, they decided to remodel the essence of its main structure and proposed an enlargement to accommodate a modern convention center within the premises.  \\n\nOn 7 October 1985, as a result of the landslide in Mameyes , the hotel was used as temporary accommodation for people affected by the floods. As the time of the relocation of the affected tenants became longer than anticipated, plans to enlarge and re-model the hotel were abandoned.  \\n\nIn 1999, George Philip Rivera, a local businessman and entrepreneur, became interested in buying and in remodeling property, and have it operate as El Vigía Hotel & Casino. He envisioned the construction of villas, a multilevel parking garage and banquet facilities.  However, by 2001 the sale had fallen through and PRIDCO put the property for sale again. CBC Development won the auction for the property and planned to demolish the structure and build a 365-unit walk-up apartment complex.  \\n\nIn 2006, PRIDCO sold the property to CBC Development, however, CBC changed the plans. It then planned to remodel the hotel, build an 80-room condo hotel, a 15,200 ft. square convention center, and 80 villas. The project was named Vista Magna Hotel & Resort. Two years later, however, in 2008, due to the estructural damage deemed too extensive, CBC decided it would instead demolish the structure and build a new hotel having some elements of the nostalgic original building.  In any event, neither repairs nor demolition took place and, in 2012, CBC Development along with the Integrated Development Commission of the South Region from the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico began considering the possibility to rehabilitate the structure to operate as a senior citizen housing complex. The plan called for 126 senior housing units.  \\n\nBy 2016, however, a new player surfaced. Juan Jose Acosta won approval to convert the building into a housing complex for homeless youth members of the LGBT community.  \\n\nIn 2018, Grupo Misla Villalba, owners of Hotel Meliá , bought the property from CBC with plans to rehabilitate the structure as a hotel.  \\n\nOn 28 July 2020, Misla Hospitality Group announced that the structure will be rehabilitated to convert it into the Puerto Rico\\'s first Tribute Portfolio by Marriott International . The hotel was preliminarily expected to open in March 2022 after an investment of $20 million. The new hotel will feature a casino, spa, night club, swimming pools, and three restaurants. It would be the second under the Marriott flag in Ponce, after the Aloft hotel located on the Ponce Bypass and PR-12 .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The hotel opened in the summer of 2009 and is known for the historic value of its structure: its main entrance is a historic colonial structure known as \"Casa Saurí\" (Saurí House). In February 2013, the hotel expanded its facilities to include a casino , a cocktail lounge , and a 4-story, 200-car parking garage .  On 1 July 2014, the owners left the Ramada namesake franchise and renamed the hotel Ponce Plaza Hotel & Casino .  \\n\nLocation and features\nThe hotel is located in the Ponce Historic Zone . It has two major buildings. The first building facing Plaza Muñoz Rivera is the historic Casa Saurí structure and it houses six colonial-style rooms plus the hotel\\'s Lola Eclectic Cuisine restaurant. The rear building located on the southeast corner of Calle Reina and Calle Mendez Vigo is a modern four-story structure housing 64 additional guest rooms as well as an indoor parking garage on the first floor and a fitness center on the fourth floor.

The hotel was built with incentives under Law 212 of the Commonwealth.  Félix Sauri y Vivas was a Ponce businessman and hacienda holder  and mayor of Ponce in 1895.  Casa Sauri is said to be the third oldest residence still standing in Ponce.  \\n\nRe-construction\nMunoz Holdings invested $15 million in the restoration and development of the original Casa Sauri property and development of the hotel\\'s modern 5-story tower.  \\n\nExpansion\nIn August 2011, hotel owners announced plans to enlarge the hotel with the addition of a casino , a large conference room , a second restaurant, and 150 additional parking spaces. The plans called for the development of the property immediately to the south of the current historic Casa Saurí, a property which also faces Plaza Muñoz Rivera. The new casino would boast 9,500 square feet of space, and the new conference rooms would be able to accommodate 200 people in a space of 6,000 square feet.  The planned parking garage opened two years later, in 2013.  The casino opened in February 2013, together with the 4-story, 200-car parking garage .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nIglesia de la Santísima Trinidad\n\\n\nThe Iglesia de la Santísima Trinidad ( Holy Trinity Church ) was organized by British residents in Ponce, Puerto Rico , as an Anglican congregation in 1869. They built their first church of wood and metal at this site in 1873, aided by materials sent by Queen Victoria \\'s government, including a bell cast in England in 1870. Located at the intersection of Marina, Mayor, and Abolicion streets, it was the first Anglican church built on the island.  Holy Trinity was still the only Protestant church in Puerto Rico at the time of the United States invasion in 1898.\\n\nBecause the old church had deteriorated, it was taken down; and a new church building was constructed on the same site in 1926. It has a synthesis of English neo-Gothic and Spanish-colonial styles. The 1870 bell was installed in the new church. The architect or designer is unknown. The church was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 29 September 1986.  \\n\nPhysical appearance\nThe Holy Trinity Church (1926) is a free-standing structure located on the east side of \"calle Marina\" at the intersection of \"calle Mayor\" and \"calle Abolición\", a public area formed by the merging of \"calle Marina\" and \"calle Mayor\".\\n\nThe building follows the typical cruciform plan, created by a double-height nave with a crossing situated just west of the semi-circular apse. The nave incorporates an interior balcony addition above the main entrance. Concrete pilaster masses along the side walls support a concrete plate which, in turn, supports the wooden king trusses of the exposed roof construction. The side walls are divided into five bays of equal width by the pilaster masses. Bays 1 through 4 are punctured by attenuated, circular-arch, glazed windows of Gothic proportions, and the transept is located at bay 5. All interior walls are free of ornamentation.  \\n\nThe exterior is characterized by the combined use of neo-Gothic and Spanish-Colonial elements. The body of the church is buttressed between the window opening along the north and south facades. The transept rises only one story in height and its gables are oriented along a north-south axis. The exterior walls are void of any ornamentation as well, and the composition is capped by a ceramic tile roof typical of mission-style churches.\\n\nThe primary facade is particularly exemplary of the combination of North-American and Hispanic influences. This facade consists of a vertical rectangular frontispiece, surmounted by a bell gable with a bell in each of its two slender Roman arches, and a cross at the ridge, resulting in a composition similar to that of many of the colonial churches found on the island. Nonetheless, the frontispiece is flanked by buttresses and is punctured by a circular window at a second-floor height, reminiscent of the neo-Gothic church architecture common throughout the United States.\\n\nA projecting, one-story, cubical reception section provides access to the nave through a semi-circular arch with iron grillework. This foyer area is sheltered by a hipped Spanish tile roof. In addition, its walls are whitewashed, in contrast to the unpainted appearance of the main body of the church, strengthening the impression of a mission-style addition to a Gothic structure.  \\n\nA small garden surrounds the building, fenced from the sidewalk by iron railings with concrete posts at equal intervals.\\n\nSignificance\nSpain permitted only Catholics to settle in its colonies in the New World: both Jews and Protestants were excluded. By the late 18th and early 19th century, they relaxed their rules to permit non- Roman Catholics to settle in various Spanish colonies, as part of trying to develop the colonies economically by attracting new immigrants.  \\n\nWith the fall of the Spanish monarchy in 1868, the first Spanish republic was formed and the Tolerance of Worship Act was approved the following year. In 1869 the first organized Protestant services in Puerto Rico were held in the city of Ponce, organized by British and other Protestant residents. During that same year, a representative group from this congregation met to plan the establishment of an Anglican church , to be known as the Holy Trinity Church.\\n\nMaterials were received from Britain, as a present from Queen Victoria to her British subjects abroad. These materials included a bell cast in England , which bears the date 1870. In 1873 the church building began construction.\\n\nAfter the Spanish Republic fell in 1874, the monarchy was reinstated. Religious intolerance returned, and colonial authorities ordered Holy Trinity Church to close. At the intervention of Queen Victoria and the British Consulate , the Spanish crown allowed the Church to function under certain conditions: the front doors were to remain closed, the bell would not be allowed to ring, and no services could be held in Spanish. These measures remained in effect until 25 July 1898, when United States troops entered Ponce. On that day, parishioners rang the bell to greet the soldiers and celebrate the restoration of religious liberty. This bell is still known as the \\'Freedom Bell\\' by the residents of Ponce.\\n\nBy 1923 the old wood and metal church had deteriorated beyond repair. Funds were raised by public subscription to build a new, more permanent structure on the same site. The new church was completed in 1926.\\n\nIt combined the use of neo-Gothic and Spanish colonial elements which synthesize the building\\'s tradition and function: the neo-Gothic represents the British religious heritage while the Spanish colonial symbolizes the community it would serve. The combination of these architectural styles, not common in Puerto Rico, makes this structure a unique example of its kind in the city of Ponce. The 1870 bell from England was installed in the new church.\\n\nWhile other churches of Anglican faith have since combined characteristics of both styles, the Holy Trinity Church appears to represent the clearest convergence, resulting in hybrid forms and elements rather than Spanish applique on a Gothic church. In addition, the church is a good example of construction in a period of cultural and architectural transition in Puerto Rico, using concrete as a main building material, but keeping with the centuries-old tradition of exposed wooden rafters and Spanish-tile roofing.  \\n\nThe synthesis of styles, technologies, and cultures represented in this building, along with the history of the congregation it serves, have been admired and respected by the people of Ponce. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places .\\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nIndustrias Vassallo\n\\n\nIndustrias Vassallo, Inc. is a \"worldwide leader\"  in the manufacture and distribution of PVC injection moulded and extruded goods, and manufacturer and distributor of PVC pipes and accessories, related plastics products, and resin furniture .  The company is located in Barrio Coto Laurel in Ponce, Puerto Rico .  In 2004, the company had a workforce of 300 employees and revenues of $51 M USD .  Its president is Rafael Vassallo.  Salvador Vassallo was the company\\'s CEO and president until his death in 2007.\\n\nHistory\nIn 1962, the four grandsons of Vicente Vassallo Fiorimonte, an Italian immigrant who established a metal shop in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1898, began experimenting with making construction products from a promising new substance, polyvinyl chloride , or PVC. With an initial investment of $3,000, their decision to start manufacturing products with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) lead to the creation of a purely Puerto Rican company that has subsequently been quite successful in the plastics industry .  \\n\nGrowth\nIn the last 50 years, Industrias Vassallo, Inc. was a pioneer in the production and distribution of PVC pipes and accessories for water and sanitary use.  The company grew, distributing its products to countries in Central and South America , the Caribbean Basin , the United States, and Canada.  Following their success of PVC pipe in the construction industry , the company established operations in the United States during the 1970s. At the same time, the company began to export to Central and South America, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean Islands.  \\n\nIn 1989, Industrias Vassallo, Inc. consolidated its operations into a new 250,000-square-foot (23,000 m 2 ) industrial complex facility located in Barrio Coto Laurel , on the outskirts of Ponce, Puerto Rico.  In 1997, Industrias Vassallo, Inc., engaged in the modernization of their plants, inaugurating a new rotomolding plant. The new unit made it possible to process up to 100,000 lbs of polyethylene per week. Polyethylene is a high impact plastic used for diverse products, such as water tanks , security barriers, kayaks and flowerpots .\\n\nIn 2004, Industrias Vassallo acquired Syroco Incorporated, a company founded by Adolph Holstein in the late 19th century. Industrias Vassallo took over the plants and assets in Arkansas, Corona, Calif., and two in New York state, near Baldwinsville, NY.  \\n\nIn 2005, and due to the increasing cost of electricity, the company considered moving its operations to the United States, but the plans were abandoned after successful negotiations with the commonwealth government .  \\n\nDespite the optimism in acquiring Syroco, the company had to develop a production strategy that would reduce expenses such as electricity cost. Due to the high cost of electricity in Puerto Rico versus Arkansas, USA, Vassallo saw a savings to the company between 10 and 13 cents per kilowatt in energy bills. As a result, ultimately the company moved all of its production facilities to the United States, and by 2011 its manufacturing facilities in Coto Laurel , Ponce, were being rented out to a college named Caribbean University. The company does continue to have a presence in Coto Laurel, where it maintains its corporate offices.  \\n\nDiversification\nFrom manufacturing and distribution of plastic pipe and accessories for sanitary and electrical applications, the company diversified into plastic furniture and accessories for household use. The company manufactures products of diverse plastic materials, among them: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene , and polypropylene .  \\n\nIn 1983, the company established Vassallo Research & Development Corporation, to fill its R&D needs, and further enhance its product line.  \"The company now holds scores of world-wide patents and is constantly developing new processes and products. Many have set national regulatory quality standards for the industry.\"  \\n\nCertifications\nIndustrias Vassallo, Inc. manufactures as per the specifications established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) agency. The company is also certified by recognized regulatory agencies such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA), the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the National Sanitary Foundation (NSF), Factory Mutual (FM), and Underwriters Laboratories (UL).  \\n\nReorganization\nThe acquisition of a company in Arkansas turned to be a bad investment for the company. In 2008, Vassallo Industries had to reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, resulting mostly from failures at the Arkansas operation. Upon reorganization a new company was created on August 26, 2010, Vassallo International Group, Inc. (VINGI), with Rafael Vassallo Collazo as its president.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\n18°2\\xe2\\x80\\xb21.97\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°32\\xe2\\x80\\xb255.93\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.0338806°N 66.5488694°W ﻿ / 18.0338806; -66.5488694 \\n"

There was an urgent need to struggle against a psychological conditioning which had become deeply rooted in our colonial society, and which led many Puerto Ricans to systematically diminish anything autochthonous or anything that seemed autochthonous, while disproportionately valuing everything that was foreign, or that seemed foreign.\"  It was in this social and sociological environment that the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña was born. The bill provoked fierce debate as, for some whose political views were in favor of the direction Puerto Rican politics had been taking in the several years prior to the debate, the bill touched on the very essence of the political status of Puerto Rico .  Once the bill was signed into law, the controversy created by the new government institution did not end.\\n\nMission\nIn general terms, the organizational structure of the Instituto responds to the functions assigned to it by Law.  Various programs address to the following aspects of the Puerto Rican culture: promote the arts, archeology, museums, parks, monuments, historic zones, music, theater, dance, and the Archives and the National Library of Puerto Rico. It extends its promotion of these throughout all the municipalities of Puerto Rico through local Cultural Centers. These Cultural Centers are autonomous organizations.  \\n\nFunctions\nThe Instituto manages the Puerto Rico General Archives ( Archivo General de Puerto Rico ) since 1956 as well as the Puerto Rico National Library , has a program on Puerto Rican archeology , sponsors programs in the visual arts, the popular arts and handcrafts, the theatrical arts, and the musical arts, has a branch that publishes books and periodicals, manages a number of museums and parks, and has restored many historic buildings throughout Puerto Rico as part of its historic zones and monuments program. Many of these buildings have been turned into museums.  As an example, as part of a project of restoration of the Ponce Historic Zone , the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña assembled a 13-member team to research and survey what changes would need to be implemented for the restoration as that zone.  \\n\nHigh-resolution images of works of art from Puerto Rico\\'s museums are being digitized and made available online with the help of the Instituto, Google Arts & Culture , Lin Manuel Miranda and other stakeholders. 350 such works were available online by November 7, 2019.    \\n\nHistory\nAccording to José Trias Monge the concern of Luis Muñoz Marín (then president of the Senate of Puerto Rico) about the role of local culture within the territorial framework of the political status of Puerto Rico dated as far back as 1949.  After being elected governor, the functionary discussed the issue again in 1953, trying to separate it from the political issue, and arguing about being selective about what should be adopted from American culture. In the days that followed the Spanish-American War, there had been a decline in the condition of historic buildings as well as an increase in consumerism. On November 18, 1954, Arnold Miles presented a \"program\" (formally named The Preservation of the Cultural Heritage of Puerto Rico) to preserve \"the cultural heritage of Puerto Rico\", asserting that it had \"been neglected\" under the American flag.  He proposed the creation of the Commonwealth Trust for Historical Preservation. Muñoz responded by congratulating Miles for the report, which was then discussed in anticipation of a legislative project.\\n\nIn January 1955, the governor announced before the legislative assembly that he intended to create a public corporation to preserve and promote Puerto Rican heritage.  Archeologist and anthropologist Ricardo Alegría , historian Arturo Morales Carrión, architect Baraño de la Junta Planes and others held reunions with Muñoz, who was also interested in acquiring the Junghanns Collection. A law allowing for the expropriation of private collections/historic documents for public display and/or preservation was assigned to then Secretary of Justice Trías Monge, with the intention of keeping it in Puerto Rico and prevent it from falling into the hands of foreign collectors. Alegría analyzed foreign laws to this effect, including countries from throughout the hemisphere. Carrión proposed following the example of the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatorian in terms of scope, but with autonomy from the central government.  He collaborated with representative Jorge Font Saldaña in the first legislative draft. The  new institution was going to be solely focused in the investigation, preservation and promotion of culture, distancing it from being a university.  \\n\nOn May 3, 1955, Project 1381 was presented before the Puerto Rico House of Representatives by its president, Ernesto Ramos Antonini.  During the ensuing debate, there was a clash between cultural nationalism and universalism, as well as the opposition arguing that it could serve as a tool for the PPD to politicize culture.  Carrión, Alegría (in representation of the UPR), Rafael A. González and Luis M. Rodríguez Morales (the latter two conservationists from San Juan) and others attended the public hearings.  Within the PPD, universalist José Arsenio Torres opposed it calling it \"of totalitarian tendencies\", argued that it was only \"going to support a political ideology [the Commonwealth]\" and dismissed this type of culture as not \"a real problem for the people\".  Independentist Marcos A. Ramírez Irizarry proposed an amendment, citing concern that \"no official interpretation of [Puerto Rican] history or cultural values\" would be \"imposed\" by it.  Statehooder Leopoldo Figueroa argued against \"culture viewed from [the PPD\\'s] perspective\", while his partner Luis A. Ferré argued against \"static culture\", before employing a universalist approach by arguing for the name to be \"Puerto Rican Institute of Culture\", de-emphasizing  local customs.\\nTwo days later, the project was sent to the Treasury Commission for the study of its scope.  On May 17, 1955, an amended version defined its functions, how the Board of Directors would elect the executive director (who would work for $9,600) and a $35,000 budget.  The project passed with 35 votes in favor and 13 against. The Senate of Puerto Rico approved it on May 25, 1955.\\nDuring the summer, Muñoz discussed his idea for \"Operation Serenity\", which he intended to serve as a counterpart to the industrialization process known as \"Operation Bootstrap\", at Harvard University.  On June 21, he signed the creation of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture into Public Law 89.\\n\nThe ICP\\'s first board included Trías Monge, Enrique Laguerre, Salvador Tió, José A. Buitrago, Carrión, secretary Teodoro Vidal and president Eugenio Fernández Méndez and first assembled on October 3, 1955, at La Fortaleza.  \\n\nSecretary of Instruction Mariano Villaronga held a meeting with Alegría about the ICP, where he noted that he would have preferred the name Comisión para la Cultura (to differentiate it from Franco\\'s Instituto de Cultura Hispánica ).  On October 10, 1955, Buitrago proposed Alegría to the role of executive director with the support of Laguerre.  Tió and Carrión proposed Nilita Vientós Gastón. Alegría won 5-1, and Muñoz Marín approved it despite having reserves with Alegría\\'s nationalist political ideology, when Tomás Blanco and the governor\\'s own wife, Ines (who had been a teacher for the young archeologist) supported it. On October 23, 1955, the Board of Directors requested a work plan, which was presented the following week covering the first year and a half of operations. Restoration of buildings and objects with cultural, historic and artistic value; preservation of historic and cultural heritage at large, gathering of valuable material; research; promotion and divulgation were the key aspects of the document. For this, the scope was to include anything following the European arrival during the 15th century up to modern times, any cultural manifestation including folklore was relevant.  The Board of Directors held frequent reunions during this stage, often bi-weekly. In the fifth, Alegría demanded a cut in his salary, but the board at large declined. Instead, he began investing it back into the ICP. Inter-agencias coordination was discussed, in particular how the Planning Board could be involved in the restoration of Old San Juan, but additional clashes and difficulties were experienced with the Treasury Department, Budget, Personnel and Supply among others.  The UPR was also defensive, believing that it was going to lose functions that had so far been controlled by it.  \\nAlegría brought members from across the political spectrum to the ICP, but it was the contract of Roberto Beascoechea Lota and Isabel Gutíerrez del Arroyo the ones that caused more trouble, being nationalists while the Gag Law was in full effect.  Francisco Espinoza of the Department of Justice interfered, but desisted from pursuing the matter after Alegría proposed that the matter was settled in a court, knowing well that Trías Monge (who had authored the Gag Law as requested, but actually opposed its implementation) was the Secretary of Justice. Marisa Rosado was later brought to work as Alegría\\'s secretary.  \\nAlegría began pursuing the acquisition of the Caguana site, which he had failed to accomplish under the UPR.  Shortly after he was confirmed in October 1955, Eliseo Combas of El Mundo sardonically criticized his interest in Talla de Santos and other similar practices.  \\n\nWith its establishment, the ICP created a series of precedents in areas such as government-sponsored cultural institutions and building restoration that preceded the cultural efforts of the federal government during the Kennedy administration (which later led to the National Foundation of Arts and Humanities during the Johnson administration and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (Robert McNutty, who advised Congress, spent time in Puerto Rico to study the restoration of San Juan and the ICP\\'s protocol, crediting Alegría for providing a definition of \"cultural heritage\".  Kennedy himself had discussed the functioning of the ICP with Alegría during his visit to Puerto Rico, as part of activism held at La Fortaleza on December 15, 1961. During the research phase that led to the law that created the National Foundation of Arts and Humanities, Livingston L. Biddle traveled to Puerto Rico and learned of the ICP\\'s restoration efforts.  Afterwards, Henry Allen Moe]] recruited Alegría as an advisor on museums for the National Endowment for the Humanities .  \\n\nIn 1959, Nelson Rockefeller attended a reunion at La Fortaleza, and during the travel came in contact with the ICP\\'s work, later loaning his collection for exhibit.  A year later, he sent a commission to study the institute\\'s work in an effort that led to the creation of the New York State Arts Council. His then-assistant Nancy Hanks described Alegría as \"an international leader [...] in the field of arts\" and credited him with inspiring the National Endowment for the Arts .  Both would later coincide at the National Council on the Arts , where he exchanged notes on his work with English-language plays at the Civic Theater and noted a similarly with the Expansion Arts initiative for minorities in the states. \\n\nBoth the pro-statehood PNP and the pro-Independence PIP internally opposed the creation of the ICP, citing through their leaders Luis A. Ferré and Gilberto Concepción de Gracia their concerns that the PPD would politicize/monopolize what constituted \"culture\".  After an extended debate, Marcos A. Ramírez Irizarry (who had been approached by PPD Jorge Font Saldaña) defeated Concepción\\'s posture among legislators, but the Executive Commission voted in support of the president and Ramírez fell in line.  Ferré continued his opposition, wanting to name it \"Puerto Rican Institute of Culture\", de-emphasizing the local culture.  Figures like José Arsenio Torres also expressed skepticism about the possibility of it serving to promote nationalism.  \\nHistorically, the PNP opposed the ICP, which they considered a \"breeding ground for radicals\".  A belief that Alegría countered by noting how artists tended to believe in independence even before joining and that figures like José Oliver, Walter Murray Chiesa and Aurelio Tió were statehooders. In private correspondence, Antonio Colorado argued in favor of Ricardo Alegría for the office of executive secretary, feeling that he didn\\'t care for compliments and would perform an efficient job, besides possessing the track record.  Alegría argued in favor of Tomás Blanco, but the latter declined due to previous differences with Muñoz Marín.  In the process, Muñoz Marín consulted figures like Arturo Morales Carrión to create a \"general plan\" to pursue several cultural proposals (among them, the restoration of Old San Juan).  \\n\nThe ICP\\'s model took inspiration from the Ecuadorian House of Culture, the Uruguayan Service of Cultural Diffusion, the American Institute of International Education and the British Council.  \\nAlegría created the ICP\\'s spectrum emphasizing his interests as an anthropologist, requiring advisers in other topics.  He established initiatives with the intention of becoming a broader \"tradition\", so it would outlive his tenure.  He held an open doors policy, welcoming whoever wanted to met with him and continued working after hours at his house. In order to keep the ICP independent of politics, orders were given not to ask affiliation, donate or even cooperate with legal investigations if the motives were deemed political.  Regardless of political influence, any individual would only be contracted if there was an opening in the pre-existing structure. Muñoz Marín\\'s wife, Inés Mendoza, had been a teacher to a young Alegría and supported several of his initiatives, also allowing a relaxed access for him to La Fortaleza.  \\nUnder Alegría, work activities would also include a cultural element, such as being held at Caguana.  \\nAlegría would initially help employees in debt, leading to the creation of the Urayoán Credit and Savings Cooperative.  \\n\nFollowing its establishment, the ICP faced critics from political figures such as Eliseo Combas Guerra of El Mundo , who either opposed promoting Puerto Rican culture as defined by \"the PPD\" or considered it an extension of the Commonwealth initiative.  \\nOther groups, such as artists Rafael Rivera García and Rafael Ferrer, resented the standards used to define art by the ICP for diverse reasons.  The traditionalist preferences of both Alegría and director José Oliver placed the ICP at odds with abstract painters, despite the collaboration of Luis Hernández Cruz with the institution. However, the curator of the Engraving Department of the New York Metropolitan Museum A. Hyatt Mayor considered that the ICP\\'s work was fostering an \"artistic explosion\" product of a changing socioeconomic landscape.  \\n\nThe ICP received control of several cultural initiatives that up to that point had been assigned to the UPR and superseded the Fine Arts Department as the main hub of development for local artists.  The further acquisition of the General Archive and its funding, which angered Benítez and his Occidentalist clique.  Arturo Morales Carrión would lead the General Archive. The ICP\\'s approach also represented a contrast to the universalist approach promoted during this time at the UPR.  Figures like Thomas S. Hayes used the press to diminish the accomplishments of the ICP and label it as unoriginal in the wake of the transfer of the archives. Despite this, others like José Arsenio Torres were moved to favor the ICP based on its political neutrality.  \\n\nIsabel Gutiérrez del Arroyo and Arturo Dávila were placed in charge of matters related to local history.  The archeological investigation program received the collaboration of Irvin Rouse (Yale) and initially focused at Caguana, also studying sites at San Juan and Aguada. The conference program began in 1956 in collaboration with the UPR, incorporating both local and foreign experts, being later compiled in 1960.\\nIn 1956, Héctor Campos Parsi was placed in charge of the Music Advisory Commission and the Musical Recording Commission.  The latter gathered a variety of 19-20 century, contemporary and folkloric recordings and documents, which was used as basis for an archive. Another initiative, the Archive of the Word, gathered speeches and other such expressions.  \\n\nWhen the UPR invited Rufino Tamayo to inaugurate a mural named Prometeo in its library, he visited the ICP and Alegría (with whom he was acquainted), a move that angered Benítez.  The ICP\\'s board would include figures like Salvador Tió, Enrique Laguerre and Eugenio Fernández Méndez.  Roberto Beascoechea aided Alegría.  In 1950, the Center of Puerto Rican Art was created.  As the transfer of the ancient Spanish forts became impending, the legislature assigned $53,000 to the ICP for their conservation.  In 1956, the cultural center program integrated pre-existing institutions, which received funds exchange for cultural work.  Established in 1957, the cultural diffusion program created a method for the cultural centers to act autonomously in regards to initiatives that originated in their vicinity rather than depend on directions from San Juan.  Other programs, like the Ballets of San Juan, were also sponsored.  The 1955 budget was $35,000.  During the early years, the budget was limited to the point that Alegría would occasionally work without being paid and had to repurpose the kitchen as his office and request funds for air conditioning.  During his stay, he didn\\'t ask for a raise and declined offers. Likewise, he used the same office for advisers Tomás Blanco and Lidio Cruz Monclova, both of whom lashed against each other upon learning of this.  Artists also clashed among themselves.A grants program was established for investigation and studies.  \\n\nFrom the beginning, the ICP and Fomento were immersed in a competition, further fueled by diverging ideas about culture among their leaders.  Alegría himself was noted for opposing the universalist concept of culture, for which he clashed with figures like Teodoro Moscoso and Luis A. Ferré, due to his belief that anything good enough to gather universal appraisal was born from within a national context. From within Fomento, the former held a belief that there was no such thing as national culture and as such introduced Festival Casals as an event were artist from abroad converged at San Juan for days and left, contrasting Alegría\\'s methodological approach.  The latter would once claim that Fomento viewed the ICP as \"trying to cling to roots that were related to the black man, to the Indian, with creole things. Which to some was mediocre, third rate.\" The rivalry between organization became so evident that César Andreu Iglesias wrote a satirical \"what-if\" piece postulating what would have if they changed seats.  The ICP mingled within the fringes of Fomento\\'s jurisdiction, fostering and promoting typical restaurants and other establishments as part of Alegría\\'s vision of a \"Puerto Rican-flavored tourism\".  The ICP freely collaborated with other government entities, such as DIVEDCO, through graphic arts initiatives.  \\n\nEarly on, individual artists (both living and dead) were also given exclusive exhibits.  In 1956, the ICP held an exhibit of 56 Campeche paintings.  \\nOn April 15, 1957, the ICP received control over the commemoration of historic dates and figures.  Monuments, paintings, books, activities and other initiatives were held to raise awareness of these. That year, Alegría himself opposed the creation of what he considered \"artificial work posts\", which were usually used in other agencies to accommodate political sympathizers, citing that doing so would reduce the institute\\'s prestige.  In 1957, the Advisory Commission of Publications was established, leading to the creation of the Biblioteca Popular and the republishing of the life\\'s work of several local authors, new works, and promoting illustration initiatives.  That year, the historical parks and museums program began, tasked with facilitating the establishment of museums, historical and archeological parks.  The restoration of Fuerte San Jerónimo (which hosted a museum of Puerto Rican military history in 1962) and of Porta Coeli (which hosted a religious history museum in 1961) began during this time. A \"rolling museum\" also served to carry exhibitions elsewhere.\\n\nOn October 7, 1957, the board declined a proposal that Alegría presented with the support of Tió to turn the Hermanos Behn house at Condado into a hotel as part of an initiative that would continue for years to \"Puerto Ricanize [the local] tourism\", then in hands of several foreign interests.  In 1958, when Fomento requested the Arsenal la Puntilla building to establish a museum, Alegría received a copy of the request and objected, due to it infringing the limits of cultural affairs assigned to the ICP.  That same year, restoration efforts at the Caparra settlement began. As part of his interest in Puerto Rican folklore, Alegría published Los renegados; Cuentos Folklóricos Puertorriqueños and The Three Wishes: A Collection of Puerto Rican Folktales .  \\n\nAdditional exhibits were held at Riverside in 1958-59 and at the Pratt Institute in 1959.  That year, the cultural centers affiliated to the ICP held their first convention.  The Ballets of San Juan joined the ICP-sponsored Puerto Rican theater festivals.  \\nThe restoration of San Juan brought forth a rare collaboration between the ICP and Fomento, although Moscoso viewed it as an opportunity to attract tourists instead of something cultural.  The entity clashed with the Corporación de Renovación Urbana y de Viviendas over the fate of La Perla.  While the latter proposed constructing a public housing project to relocate the residents, the ICP proposed building an urbanization at La Puntilla for them and then turning the zone into a park. Neither project advanced, and despite the houses at La Puntilla being built, they were instead sold to middle class families to the ire of Alegría.\\n\nIn 1958, the ICP\\'s Graphic Arts Studio (Taller) was inaugurated and Lorenzo Homar (who had already done the same at DIVEDCO) was placed in charge, holding the office for 15 years and producing over 400 pieces.  That year, the Casa del Libro was transferred to the ICP.  \\nIn 1959, the ICP sponsored the bilingual appearance of Los soles truncos at the Goodman Memorial Theater as part of the Festival de las Americas held at Chicago.  The restoration initiatives also attracted the attention of Austrian social philosopher Leopoldo Kohr, who wrote that the \"paradox of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture is that almost everything it does is right and almost everything it reasons is wrong\", complimenting that it \"is superior to anything that has been accomplished in England, France or Italy\" despite what he perceived to be \"Alegría\\'s Petronius-like\" role.  \\nBy 1960, the budget had increased to $421,500 by the legislature.  The next year the board attended the Treasury Commissions of the legislature, citing that the budget was insufficient to contrast specialized personnel or even competing with other government agencies. A raise for Alegría was proposed, despite his personal opposition.\\n\nIn 1960, the rezoning of parts of San Juan (of interest were Calle Sol, Calle de la Cruz and Calle San Sebastián and what was west of Calle Cristo) was proposed to prevent the proliferation of bars, which was justified as an attempt to neutralize the potential emergence of a \"bohemian village\".  Furthermore, this was influenced by Alegría\\'s interest to turn San Juan into more than \"a purely touristic zone\" and restore its residential value.\\nIn 1961, activities were held to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the ICP, which introduced the award of gold medals to figures within culture (a ceremony later held every 5 years).  That same year, Alegría denounced before the PPD\\'s youth organization of Río Piedras that the UPR under Benítez had \"ignored Puerto Rican culture\".  \\nThe Cuban Revolution impacted how the left perceived his work at the ICP, while Alegría himself considered the idea of nationalism being pushed by Marxist-influenced groups was blinding them from other modalities and that such exaggerations -product of stances then in vogue- \"was mud slinging [the Puerto Rican] people and [their] character\".  \\nThe ICP sent its book, Folklore Puertorriqueño abroad for re-editing.  Upon being returned in October 1960, the customs administrator Francisco López Domínguez objected to its entry due to \"vulgar\" language, requiring the intervention of Resident Commissioner Antonio Fernós.\\n\nUpon learning that San Cristóbal and El Morro would be transferred to the National Forest Service, Alegría urged the military adviser to the governor -Teodoro Vidal- to make a push for them to be awarded to the local government instead and criticized the support of the Resident Commissioner for the initiative.  Vidal later forwarded him a letter from Fernós Insern, arguing that he actually wanted for the preservation to be funded by foreign funds while the terrains of El Morro to be assigned to the local government.\\nAt the restored Casa del Callejón, museums to the 19th Century Puerto Rican family and the city\\'s colonial architecture were established in 1963.  That same year, a choral poesy program was created.  \\n\nAs early as 1964, the funding for cultural initiatives began declining, a situation that Alegría protested the following year.  The budget of $900,000 for 1965 did not allow for the creation of a National Museum, School of Dramatic Arts, a Central Library or a School of Danza, which required at least $1,500,000 per the projections.  On July 10, 1964, Muñoz Marín noted that The San Juan Star had been publishing a section called \"Today in History\" where they discussed foreign events, commissioning the ICP to create a historic calendar of Puerto Rico so that newspapers would publish local events as well.  \\nIn 1965, the ICP inaugurated an archeological park at the Caguana site, which had been previously acquired by the institution.  The following year, independentist Nilita Vientós Gastón wrote about the ICP\\'s role in the wake of its tenth anniversary, citing her belief that the PPD had used it in trying to convert Puerto Rican culture into a \"niche\" while pushing an \"ambiguous\" political protect such as the Commonwealth.\\n\nIn 1966 Alegría led the charge in an attempt to have Fort Brooke transferred to the ICP, where it would house the Conservatorio de Música and Casals Festival.  That same year, the ICP created a band that would perform at public plazas.  The Quinteto Figueroa and Cantores del ICP represent other groups affiliated to the institute. The music archive was transferred to the Archivo General.  The Celebration of Puerto Rican Music began this year, becoming an annual celebration, featuring a number of competitions involving native instruments and displays of genres like plena and danza.  The ICP\\'s Cords Orquesta was also established. That year, Rafael Rivera García noted that he would no longer publicly criticize the ICP, believing that his previous concerns about the philosophical direction were unwarranted.  In 1967, the Biblioteca General de Puerto Rico was created by the legislature and placed under the jurisdiction of the ICP.  \\n\nThat same year several individuals involved in the effort to restore the city of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic traveled to Puerto Rico and requested help from Alegría, implanting the ICP\\'s model and receiving constant advise from him during the project.  Alegría was contacted by the governments of St. Augustine and Grenada to provide guidance in their own restoration efforts and on how to employ tax exemptions to benefit owners of historic buildings.  \\n\nExecutive of investor Esso Standard Oil Andrés Freites later credited him for the success of the first phase and requested his collaboration during the second phase.\\nThe Museo de Bella\\'s Artes established in 1967, within a structure given to the ICP and resorted.  \\nThe San Juan Star made use of a piece published by Jay Jacobs claiming that Puerto Rican culture \"never was\" and lashing against Homar and his colleagues as having \"passed the point where they might have done anything important\".  He was rebutted by Marta Traba, who further considered his posture a form of \"cultural imperialism\". \\nIn 1969, the owners of several restored buildings formed the Asociación pro Desarollo del San Juan Antiguo.  \\nIn 1969, the Ballet Folklórico Areyto was founded, debuting in the Puerto Rican Theater Festival.  The houses of Luis Muñoz Rivera and José Celso Barbosa were restored and converted into museums.  \\nIn 1971, the ICP inaugurated a pharmacy museum.  In 1972, Leopold Kohr would write positively about the ICP\\'s work in a piece for El Mundo , citing the restoration effort as breathing life back to the scenery.  Likewise, Lemaitre Román invited Alegría to participate in the restoration of Cartagena de Indias.  Similar requests came from Kingston, Christianstead, Toronto and  Cap Haitien. During his visit to Puerto Rico in 1968, William Murtagh of the NPS recognized that through the ICP \"the government of Puerto Rico had been at the vanguard of the restoration movement since 1955\".  \\n\nAs soon as Luis A. Ferré won the elections, there were calls from within that party to have Alegría removed from the ICP due to ideological differences and a campaign against him was launched by Pedro Vázquez in El Día .  He did not attend when the new governor was sworn in and on January 13, 1969, presented his resignation.  However, the board refused to accept it and figures like Nilita Vientós, Noel Colón Martínez, Gilberto Concepción and Inés Mendoza rallied behind him, along a number of mayors and cultural centers. Within the statehood movement, Genarín Cautiño, Aurelio Tió and Carlos A. Pesquera Reyes supported him. Carlos E. Chardón wrote to José M. Hernández Matos of the ICP\\'s Cultural Promotion Program suggesting that Alegría should stay long enough to finish his ongoing work. Eventually, Ferré reached a compromise with the ICP to secure better funding. Alegría remained in his office and worked on restoring La Fortaleza\\'s internal decoration, but not without requesting the release from jail of Puerto Rican nationalists.  \\n\nIn February 1969, the PNP presented a bill to end the Ponce historic zone, despite the ICP having begun the restoration process.  By this time, Alegría\\'s family (in particular his brother José) had been targeted by groups that wanted to equal the project supposed familiar links to real state at San Juan, something that he had to personally rebuff in a letter to El Día .  Despite Ferré\\'s apparent support to continue his work at Ponce and the creation of a special committee that gave active participation to the ICP in that process, Alegría faced constant pressure to leave his office.  Other clashes included, Carlos Romero Barceló attempt to get rid of a building that was halfway restored, Dos Zaguantes, which the ICP acquired with a loan from the bank of Fomento. The ICP, however, was able to preserve its fiscal autonomy and secure funds. Between March and April 1970, the ICP presented a version of Pedro Animala .  That same year, the work of Puerto Rican artists abroad was featured.  \\n\nIn 1970, a museum about the colonization of Puerto Rico was inaugurated at the Caparra ruins, which featured Juan Ponce de León\\'s baptismal font.  \\nOn August 20, 1970, Alegría wrote to the administrative officer, Raúl Joglar, to oppose using resources to increase his salary.  Ultimately, he reinvested the $204.17 difference back to the ICP, so it could be used to fund diverse initiatives (with the poor students of the Plastic Arts School taking priority).  \\nIn 1971, another Campeche exhibit was held.  \\nThe 1971 gathering of the Historic American Building Survey took place at San Juan in May.  Six months later, Charles Peterson and Francisco Pons-Sorolla attended a conference on building restoration sponsored by Centro Norte-Sur. In April 1972, the ICP received $2,855,000 to fund the historic monument and buildings initiatives and the construction of the Centro de Bella\\'s Artes at Santurce.  That year, its production The Three Wishes was exhibited by the Library of Congress along other children\\'s books in 1972.  \\n\nA controversy emerged from the use of funding for the second Biennial, some of which came from a celebration of the Second Centenary of the United States.  Alegría, a supporter of independence himself, argued that he saw nothing wrong since the use of these funds didn\\'t affect the content. However, Homar left his office at the Escuela de Artes Plásticas.In 1972, the ICP received $125,000 from the National Fund of Arts, led by \\nNancy Hanks.  \\nFerré, who supported the creation of a culture \"without last names\", was blamed by Alegría for \"debilitating the institution\".  \\nIn June 1973, Francisco Arriví protested the discrepancies between his salary and that of Elías López from Festival Casals.  \\n\nIn 1974, Alegría proposed that each municipality should host festivals of something relevant to them.  \\nDuring Alegría\\'s tenure, the ICP restored 30 buildings and promoted the independent restoration of several others according to its guidelines.  Under him the Institute also managed to broaden the meaning of \"Puerto Rican\" to include non-Spanish aspects and counter those that considered the promotion of Taíno or Afro-Caribbean culture unsophisticated or \"crazy\".  Alegría also documented the ICP itself, publishing El Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña: los primeros cinco años, 1955-1960 , Los museos del Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña and El Instituto e Cultura Puertorriqueña 1955-1973: 18 años contribuyendo a fortalecer nuestra conciencia nacional .  \\n\nThe move to the convent, however, was followed by a systematic increase in bureaucracy.  When combined with an increasingly widened umbrella that extended with the agreement with the University of Buffalo, the work flow proved to be complicated for the personnel.\\nAlegría later noted that he left the ICP because he had grown tired of being incapable of working efficiently with other agencies amidst the increasing bureaucracy.  He resented that being forced to spend most of his time doing paperwork for the Office of the Comptroller of Puerto Rico was limiting what the ICP could do. The governor initially resisted his resignation, but eventually accepted it. The personnel of the ICP was surprised by the decision. The board, led by Laguerre, also struggled to acquiesce the decision, but after two sessions accepted it \"with reluctance\" all the while urging him to continue involved in the institute\\'s initiatives.  \\n\nAfter leaving, Alegría noted that his contribution was \"strengthening the national conscience\" and popularizing a local history and figures that he considered Puerto Rican \"can be proud of\".  While noting satisfaction that local culture had become highly popular, he also cautioned against focusing on the culinary and superfluous instead of the more significant  aspects. Alegría also blamed improper funding and lack of interagency communication with the diffusion of culture not living up to its potential.  Furthermore, he criticized the Department of Instruction for introducing children to foreign celebrations.\\nArturo Dávila credited him with \"breaking the ice\" in topics that were previously disregarded by \"intellectuals with 19th Century ideas\".  \\n\nAt the time, the ICP had grown to have 160 employees, a budget of $2,700,00, created 16 new museums and had worked in all municipalities, with 88 cultural centers affiliated to it.  \\nAlegría left several unfished projects, including the creation of museums for the sugar and coffee industries, history of Puerto Rican theater, postal stamps and numismatics, history of Puerto Rican music and Puerto Rican history.  An unfinished museum of popular arts was later created at Balljá, an unrelated museum of the history of Ponce replaced another inconclusive initiative while his Hacienda Buena Vista, which the ICP had tried to acquire prior to the change in administration, would establish a museum of its agricultural history.  \\n\nRodríguez Morales succeeded him and brokered an advisor role for Alegría for which he was only paid a dollar per year.  In this role he oversaw the creation of the Museo de la Herencia Puertorriqueña at the restored Dos Zaguanes building,  for which he brought indigenous pieces from the piaroas and guahibos of the Orinoco region. He also continued directing the ICP\\'s magazine.  \\nThe AFAC had a duplicity of several of the ICP\\'s functions, but its direct connection to the governor benefited the new entity and weakened the latter.  The initiative had been pushed by Ferré from the Senate of Puerto Rico, who had invited Alegría to draft it. The former director declined and attended the hearings to argue against it, joining an opposition that was highlighted by the Comité Pro-Defensa de la Cultura Puertorriqueña and had been protesting outside the Capitolio, arguing that it was a de facto attempt to repeal \"the law that created the institute\". From within the ICP, only Héctor Campos Parsi argued in favor, leading to distancing and public critics from the other members.  Executive director Luis Rodríguez Morales requested  amendments. An elderly Muñoz Marín used the debilitation of the ICP as a weapon to criticize the PNP administration and claimed that if left unsupervised, they would \"destroy its accomplishments\".  \\nThe laws were passed in May 1980, prompting Rodríguez Morales to quit. Romero Barceló named nuclear physicist Leticia del Rosario to replace him. In response to the appointment of a person with no experience in cultural affairs, the directors of the General Library (Roberto Beascoechea), Program of Modern Mediums of Massive Communication (Alberto Rodríguez), of Theater Promotion (Francisco Arriví) and of Cultural Promotion (Carlos Padilla) left their offices.  Alegría also left the ICP\\'s magazine after issue 85 (October-December 1979).  \\n\nLeticia del Rosario had the Museo de la Herencia Puertorriqueña closed.  Political struggles, misdirection, lack of proper care have led to part of Alegría\\'s work being discontinued after his tenure.  \"Changes in museology\" were cited by Mario Molina as the cause behind the closesure of several of the museums from the Alegría era.  \\nEntering the early 2000s, the early work of the ICP was still a point of contention among academics.  \\nJames Martson Fitch and Charles Peterson of Columbia University were impressed at the restoration during a visit to San Juan.  \\nAfter being named executive director of the ICP by Carlos Romero Barceló, Leticia del Rosario stopped the establishment of a children museum at the Polvorín de Santa Elena, which had been underway since the days of Alegría.  \\n\nAfter the PNP loss the 1984 elections, Elías López Sobá was named executive director of the ICP.  Alegría pushed a project for cultural promotion, that would assign two more millions to the budget of the ICP, eliminating the AFAC and providing reparations for the perceived damage that its creation had done to the institution.  Supported by Velda González, the legislation proceeded. The \"Plan Alegría\" would later make way for the Fondo Nacional para el Financiamiento del Quehacer Cultural. In 1985, the Centro de Bella\\'s Artes was assigned to the ICP, but remaining under an independent subdirector.  He also argued in favor of more autonomy for the ICP, removing the need for a governor appointment, expanding the board and giving space to the Ateneo and other culinary institutions to name members.  \\n\nLópez Sobá\\'s administration was controversial and in May 1985 Velda González opposed the project that modified the CBA\\'s role and granted it to the ICP, believing that it gave too much influence to the director.  A number of musicians supported her posture. By November the press was reporting on increasing unsatisfaction with his performance.\\n\nOn March 28, 1985, Elías López Sobá was named ICP director.  Alegría, however, did not attend his inauguration. The Museo de las Américas, left unfinished by Alegría decades before, was finally inaugurated in 1992.  That year, the recordings of the Musical Recording Commission were transferred to the AGPR.  \\nWhen the Pedro Rosselló administration announced its intention to create the Museo Nacional de Bella\\'s Artes, Alegría wrote a note to Awilda Palau, concerned that it may lead to stripping the ICP of its collections.  \\n\nIn 1997\\'s Sponsored Identities Arlene Dávila argued that the ICP\\'s work had allowed the PPD to \"disguise its political dependent status\", claiming that \"the nation was associated with the realm of the cultural\" and that by giving the independentists a niche they also took away political influence.  In 1999, the ICP created the Museo de la Herencia Africana, which had been first proposed by Alegría during his incumbency.  The institution eventually settled into the old Asilo de Beneficiencia, where it remains.  The institution was one of 30 that joined in the celebrations surrounding Alegría\\'s 80th birthday.  \\n\nImpact and reception\nOn November 19, 1960, the newspaper El Mundo interviewed several figures requesting their feedback on the work done by the ICP during its first five years.  Writer Margot Arce de Vázquez considered its arrival \"opportune in [that] critical moment of the life of our people\", and a tool to bring \"historic conscience and responsibility\" and countering indifference over knowledge of its roots. Writer José M. Lázaro considered its work \"extraordinary\" and within its intended purpose.  Writer Vicente Géigel Polanco considered that the promotion of cultural fields was \"of the upmost quality\", also noting Alegría as \"hardworking\". Painter Rafael Tufiño considered that the ICP\\'s programs were \"well intended\" and that its artistic grants had been \"well oriented\". Architect José Firpi said that its restoration of Old San Juan had been \"an important contribution that worked as guide for the cultural life of [the Puerto Rican] people\" and credited it for rescuing \"long forgotten values\". Writer Emilio S. Belaval assessed that the ICP \"met [the standards] of the humanistic program of institutions of its [kind]\", crediting Alegría with creating a balance that was \"noble\" and did not go as far as \"deify culture\".  Composer Amaury Veray discussed the extent of the cultural centers in promoting music, something that he considered had \"transcendental importance in the preservation of the Puerto Rican root[s].\" Poet Manuel Joglar Cacho credited Alegría\\'s work for the success of the Congresos de Poesía, calling the ICP itself a \"very necessary institution\".  Writer María Teresa Babín States that the ICP was involved in a \"crusade in pro of Puerto Rican nationality [in the process] securing the future of Puerto Rico within the hispanic orbit of America\" and urged the readers to be proud of the Board of Directors. Painter Rafael Ríos Rey noted \"appreciated the [artistic creation] task\" of the ICP. Composer Héctor Campos Parsi called it a reflection \"of the inherent greatness of [the Puerto Rican people]\" and gauged its work as \"prodigious\".  Poet Francisco Matos Paoli argued that the \"Puerto Rican homeland was in debt\" with the ICP and Alegría, closing by saying that \"any grateful man should clap\". \\n\nWayne Grover of the National Archives and Records Administration said that \"the Government and people of Puerto Rico have reasons to be profoundly proud of what [had] been accomplished in such a short time\". Spanish linguist Tomás Navarro Tomás called its first years \"astounding\", calling it an \"example\" for other places.  Writer Monelisa Pérez Marchand called the ICP the \"unwavering watchtower of [Puerto Rican] cultural heritage\", which she claimed was achieved without \"false patriotism or outrageous chauvinism\". Historian Luis M. Díaz responsibilities it for \"liberating [the public] from its indifference for all things cultural\". Playwright Gerard P. Marín noted that he was initially skeptical of the ICP, but that what had taken place -despite being insufficient for a full assessment- had been positive.  Painter Miguel Pou considered that it had filled a void in the education of cultural values. Writer René Marqués discussed the difficulties of engaging in \"direct and uninterrupted cultural activity\" within the government agency with limited budget and personnel, arguing that it was worthy of praise and also assessing that its work was \"valuable, of permanent character\". Linguist Rubén del Rosario called the work of the ICP unprecedented in Puerto Rico and evaluated that it had so far avoided politicization or chauvinism, something that he considered worthy of felicitations.  Cuban writer Eugenio Florit commented on the ICP\\'s literature, calling it \"praise worthy\" and stated that work of this kind would \"honor any country\". Writer Gilberto Concepción de Gracia discussed its \"extraordinary work\" and the \"competence\" of Alegría as its director. Architect Santiago Iglesias Jr. assessed that the ICP had coordinated the fine arts  and that it \"deserve[d] the recognition of all Puerto Rico\". Poet Diana Ramírez de Arellano called the promotion of Puerto Rican culture an \"unreplacable patriotic  work\".  \\nHistorian Adolfo de Hostos credited it with being effective in the diffusion of local history through a number of venues, including the arts and the restoration of Old San Juan. Writer Gustavo Agraít credited Alegría with being able to quell the concerns that emerged when the ICP was created by the government. Architect Carlos R. Sanz called the restoration \"gigantic and highly valuable\".  Writer Emilio J. Pasarell called it a \"beginning worthy of praise and promising of a complete task\". Writer Juan Martínez Capó considered that the ICP\\'s publishing division was undertaking a work that was overdue in republishing prominent authors. Writer Cesáreo Rosa Nieves emphasized the \"deep island roots\" of the \"nativist efforts\" of the ICP, calleing it award-worthy.  Wroter Figueroa Barrios considered that the institution was carrying out \"services that any government owes to its people\". Poet Carmelina Vizcarrondo expressed he faith that the ICP would continue its work within the arts and culture. Spanish linguist Samuel Gili Gaya said that usually cultural institutions took time to produce results, but that somehow the ICP had \"surprises with a brilliant harvest\" within five years, a sign of the maturity of its collaborators. Writer Luis Hernández Aquino noted that all fields of arts had \"been favored\" as part of a \"wonderful cultural work\".  \\n\nIn 1973, several figures gauged the ICP\\'s work as it neared two decades of existence. Spanish musician Pablo Casals called what had been achieved \"notable\". Historian Arturo Morales Carrión noted that he felt \"profound spiritual satisfaction\" at what had been achieved.  Architect MARIO Buschiazzo noted that the ICP had fulfilled initiatives that had been unsuccessfully proposed to the Junta de Planificación concerning the restoration of Old San Juan. Politician Luis A. Ferré congratulated Alegría for a \"magnificent work\". Actress Mona Marti emphasized the theater festival as an example of how that field had been advanced by the institution. Writer José Agustín Balseiro noted the struggles that took place in order to restore Old San Juan and praises the work done with popular art.  Argentinian professor Aurelio Tanodi said that he was \"impressed\" with the work done at Old San Juan, which he called a rare sight in the Americas. Poet Juan Antonio Corretjer argued that Alegría\\'s formation was responsible for the work accomplished so far, all the while criticizing the management of the historic buildings prior to the creation of the ICP and expressing concern that as long as sovereignty rested in foreign hands it could be undone.  The curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Hyatt Mayor called it \"a radiant center of culture on the Island\", one \"of all arts, whose light will radiate all around\", further stating that he \"admire[d Alegría\\'s] intelligence\". Writer Tomás Blanco argued that it deserved \"the congratulations and cooperation of any good Puerto Rican\". Restoration expert Charles E. Peterson said that he \"believed [the restoration of Old San Juan] an outstanding success\" product of a \"comprehensive and well-thought-out program\".  Catholic cardinal Luis Aponte Martínez provided \"a testimony of admiration and gratitude\" to the ICP and Alegría for the work done on historic religious sites at San Juan and San Germán. Inés Mendoza, former teacher of Alegría and wife to governor Muñoz Marín, claimed that the ICP had salvaged the national and cultural heritage of Puerto Rico and brought forth an artistic and cultural renaissance, crediting the director for this success.  Archeologist Irving Rouse wrote that the ICP had \"achieved more than any other country that [he had] visited and that its work is of the highest quality\". Edward P. Alexander of the Colonial Williamsburg site noted that while the work was based on \"its authenticity based on historical and archeological research\", it also kept San Juan a living city with great cultural relevance\", also crediting the \"broad programs of your Institute of Puerto Rican Culture [and this] kind of cultural entrepreneurship\" with making \"Puerto Rico a delightful place in which to live of visit\".  Henry Allen Moe of the New York State Historical Association credited Alegría with \"pre-eminence in the field of cultural activities, including museums\".\\n\nIn 1965, Ursula von Eckardt of the UPR and universalit wrote criticizing the ICP, claiming that it was \"fostering a museum-like institution which preserves monuments of \\'Puerto Rican\\' native culture under glass for the self-glorification of a small establishment of \"intellectuals\" who are worried about their own \"identity\".  In his own words, Mario Vargas Llosa noted that he was impressed by the ICP\\'s restoration of San Juan, hosting Alegría in his La Torre de Babel show in 1981.  \\n\nMuseums\nThe Instituto operates a number of museums throughout the island. They include:\\n\nOther institutions\nThe Instituto also owns other properties including the Centro Cultural de Ponce Carmen Solá de Pereira (Ponce Cultural Center).  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFootnotes \\n\nBibliography \\n\nExternal links\n18°28\\xe2\\x80\\xb203\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°07\\xe2\\x80\\xb214\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.46757°N 66.12065°W ﻿ / 18.46757; -66.12065 \\n"

It also provided defenses for the entrance of the Bayamón River on the other side of the islet.\\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a leper colony was established on the island. On December 17, 1876, the governor of Puerto Rico , Segundo de la Portilla , set the first stone of the official building to house lepers, which was completed in 1883. However, it is believed that the colony was established prior to construction of the building.

According to the 1910 US Census , there were 35 people living on the island at that time.

However, the original building still stands on Isla de Cabras.\\n\nIn the 1940s, the United States built Fort Amezquita (named for Juan de Amézqueta ), a few hundred feet from El Cañuelo . The fort was initially called the \"Cabras Island Military Reservation\". During World War II this fort served as a \"concrete gun battery\" for the US Army Coast Artillery Corps . In November 1940 the US Army transferred the barrels of three 12-inch coastal guns from Fort Delaware , Delaware ; two of these guns were mounted in the fort as Battery Reed with the third as a spare.

        "page_content": "Contents\nIsla de Mona\n\\n\nMona Island  is the third-largest island of the Puerto Rican archipelago , after the main island of Puerto Rico and Vieques . It is the largest of three islands in the Mona Passage , the strait between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, with the others being Monito Island and Desecheo Island . It measures about 7 miles by 4 miles (11 km by 7 km), and lies 41 mi (66 km) west of Puerto Rico, of which it is administratively a part. It is one of two islands that make up the Isla de Mona e Islote Monito barrio in the municipality of Mayagüez .\\n\nThe island is managed under the Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserve ( Reserva Natural Islas de Mona y Monito ).  There are no permanent inhabitants; only rangers and biologists from the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources reside on the island, to manage visitors and take part in research projects. The island, along with Monito, form part of the Mona and Monito Islands National Natural Landmark  which recognizes and preserves the islands\\' ecosystem as an outstanding example of diversity and natural history.  The island is home to a number of endemic species such as the Mona ground iguana and it is an important seabird area.  \\n\nHistory\nMona Island is believed to have been originally settled by the Taíno since the 12th century or sooner.  An archeological excavation during the 1980s discovered many Pre-Columbian objects on the island that helped support historians\\' theories of the island\\'s first inhabitants. Stone tools found in a rock shelter have been dated to around 3000 BC .  Much later the island was settled by the Taínos and remained so until the arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century.  \\n\nOn November 19, 1493, during his second voyage to the New World , Christopher Columbus encountered the island now known as Puerto Rico, which the natives called Borinquen (or Borikén ), and which Columbus named San Juan Bautista (Saint John the Baptist). Within hours of setting foot in Puerto Rico, Columbus and his ships headed west to Hispaniola , where he expected to meet several crewmembers who had remained behind from his first voyage. As he left Puerto Rico, he reputedly became the first European to sight the island on September 24, 1494, which was claimed for Spain. The name Mona derives from the Taíno name \\xc3\\x81mona , bestowed by the natives in honor of the ruling Cacique or chief of the island.\\n\nIn 1502, Fray Nicolás de Ovando was sent to Isla de la Mona to keep an eye, from a safe distance, on the native revolts occurring in Hispaniola. With a group of 2,000 Spanish settlers, Ovando was left in charge of creating a permanent settlement on the island. Due to its small size and location, the island proved inadequate to accommodate such a large settlement, and food became scarce as shipments from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico were received infrequently.\\n\nJuan Ponce de León , who accompanied Columbus on his first two voyages, became the first ruling governor of Puerto Rico .  \\n\nIn 1515, after some wrangling, Ferdinand II was able to reclaim the island from Diego Colón , Viceroy of the Indies . By then, Isla de la Mona was an important point of trade between Spain and the rest of Latin America, as well as a rest stop for the crews of boats carrying slaves. With his possession of the island, King Ferdinand II gave the resident Taínos two options if they wished to continue living on the island: they could work by fishing, making hammocks and cultivating plants, or they could become miners and help in the mining of guano and other minerals. Realizing that mining would require intense labor, the majority of inhabitants chose to work as fishermen and farmers. By accepting this option, they also were exempted from paying imposed taxes, and were able to avoid the hard labor many other natives endured in mines. In time, natives from other neighboring islands were brought to Mona Island to assist with labor.\\n\nAfter the death of Ferdinand II in 1516, ownership of the island was transferred to Cardenal Cisneros. The island changed ownership again in 1520, when Francisco de Barrionuevo became the island\\'s new landlord. By 1524, Alonso Manso , bishop of Puerto Rico, had become interested in gaining personal wealth, and he accused Barrionuevo, among others, of various crimes under the Spanish justice system of the time. Because of this situation, Barrionuevo exiled himself to one of Spain\\'s colonies in South America, taking many Taínos along with him, and leaving the island practically deserted.\\n\nBy 1522, ships from other major sea powers such as England , France , and the Netherlands began to arrive at Isla de la Mona to replenish supplies for their transatlantic voyages. The island also provided a refuge from which they, as well as pirates, could attack and plunder Spanish galleons .\\n\nIn 1561, during an audience held in Santo Domingo , it was recommended that Isla de la Mona should become a part of that colony (which at the time occupied the entirety of Hispaniola). The reasons offered were simply that the island was closer to Santo Domingo (presently the Dominican Republic ) than to Puerto Rico, and that it had a small population which could help the colony\\'s economy in overall agricultural production. However, the petition was turned down and the island continued to remain politically part of Puerto Rico.\\n\nIn 1583, the Spanish archbishop of Puerto Rico received royal permission to bring Christianity to Mona Island. However, by this time most Taínos remaining on the island had either died or fled to mainland Puerto Rico due to repeated raiding by European (especially French) ships. From the end of the 16th century up until the mid-19th century the island was largely abandoned by the colonial authorities. It seems to have been sporadically inhabited, although records from this period are somewhat sketchy. It continued to be used as a refuge by pirates and privateers, including the notorious Captain Kidd who hid out there in 1699.  \\n\nThe island\\'s circumstances changed in the mid-19th century when it became the site of commercial guano mining operations. Various companies were granted licenses to extract the bat and seagull guano (a valuable fertilizer and key strategic commodity for the production of gunpowder) from the island\\'s caves. Mining continued until 1927.  \\n\nWith the 1898 Treaty of Paris , Isla de la Mona, along with the rest of Puerto Rico, was handed to the United States by Spain. The population of Mona Isla was six at the time.  Within two years of occupation, the Mona Island Light , left in an unfinished state since the beginning of the Spanish-American War , was completed and began operation. The lighthouse was not, as commonly believed, designed by Gustave Eiffel , but by the Spanish engineer Rafael Ravena in 1886. It was accessible by the Mona Island Tramway from the beach and remained in continuous operation until 1976 when it was replaced by a newer automated light near the center of the island.  \\n\nOn December 22, 1919, the island was declared an Insular Forest of Puerto Rico , under the auspices of the U.S. Forest Law No. 22.\\n\nDuring Prohibition the island had a history of smuggling , with its geographic location making it a prime location for rum runners to smuggle rum, bourbon , and other liquor. In 1923, a stash of liquor, drugs, and perfumes, reportedly from the French islands of Martinique and Saint Martin and worth US$75,000, was found in a cave by customs officials.\\n\nIn 1942, at the height of World War II , a German U-156 submarine fired 30 shells from its deck gun at the southern coast of the island. The crew of the Nazi vessel suspected that Camp Cofresí, a camp that the Civilian Conservation Corps were using as the base of a reforestation effort, could be an unmarked military facility. There were no significant losses, but the incident was one of the few military strikes of the war in the Caribbean , which was also the focus of a German/Italian campaign against Allied resource shipping. Prior to this, the Nazi U-boat had sunk nineteen ships in the region including one named Del Plata in Puerto Rican waters. On June 4, 1942, the oil tanker MV C.O. Stillman was sunk by the German submarine U-68 41 nautical miles (76 km) southwest of Isla de Mona.  From 1945 to 1955 Mona Island was leased to the U.S. Air Force as a military exercise area.\\n\nSince 1941 the island has also been used for camping and hunting goats and wild boar. In 1960 a small ranger post was established to monitor the island, operated by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources .\\n\nIn July 1972 the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board , because of growing interest in the development of the islands, made a full scientific assessment of Mona and Monito using a local team of volunteer scientists. A two-volume report with maps of natural and historic features was produced.  It evaluated the climate, geology and mineral resources, soils, water resources, archaeology, vegetation, animals and insects, and pelagic life around the island. Shortly thereafter geotechnical and bathymetric studies were conducted by engineering firms to determine the feasibility of using Mona as a deep-water terminal for transferring oil from supertankers to smaller tankers which would continue to the mainland US; this plan was never implemented.\\n\nIn 1981, the Mona Island Light was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as Faro de la Isla de la Mona .\\n\nOn February 15, 1985, the passenger-cargo ferry MV A Regina ran aground on a reef on the southeastern side of Mona Island. While there were no deaths nor serious injuries, 143 passengers and 72 crew members landed on Mona Island to await rescue. The wreck of the ship was removed from the reef in 1990.\\n\nIn 1993, the island, inscribed as Isla de la Mona , was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.  The historic district consists of eight contributing buildings (including the lighthouse), nine prehistoric and historic archaeological sites (including several ceremonial ball courts or bateyes ), two guano industrial ruins, a roadway and a cistern.  \\n\nGeography\nMona has an area of about 22 sq mi (57 km 2 ) and lies 41 mi (66 km) west of the main island of Puerto Rico, 38 mi (61 km) east of the Dominican Republic , and 30 mi (48 km) southwest of Desecheo Island , another island in the Mona Passage .\\n\nMona has been designated an ecological reserve by the Puerto Rican government and is not permanently inhabited. The US census of 2000 reported six housing units, but a population of zero.  The island is a barrio of the municipality of Mayagüez , together with Monito Island 3.1 mi (5 km) northwest ( Isla de Mona e Islote Monito barrio ). This is the largest ward of Mayagüez by area, and the only one without permanent population. The total land area of both islands in the barrio is about 21.98 square miles (56.93 km 2 ) (Mona Island 21.924 square miles [56.783 km 2 ] and nearby Monito Island 0.057 square miles [0.147 km 2 ]), and it comprises 28.3 percent of the total land area of the municipality of Mayagüez. Desecheo Island , 30 mi (49 km) to the northeast, is part of Sabanetas barrio.\\n\nMona is a mainly flat plateau surrounded by sea cliffs. It is composed of dolomite and limestone with many caves found throughout.  With an arid climate and untouched by human development, many endemic species inhabit the island, such as the Mona ground iguana ( Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri ). Its topography, ecology, and modern history are similar to that of Navassa Island , a small limestone island located in the Jamaica Channel , between Jamaica and Haiti .\\n\nThere are around 200 caves, including El gato , La esperanza , La negra ,\\n Los ingleses , El rifle , El toro , Del norte , Ataúd , Nuevos Lirios and Gallinas  on Isla de Mona, with thousands of examples of native art, marks and later on, graffiti.    \\n\nThe Isla de Mona has a tropical savanna climate ( Aw according to the K\\xc3\\xb6ppen climate classification ), with a dry season and wet season and the temperature being warm year-round. The average annual mean is 26.6 °C (79.9 °F), an average annual high is 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) and an average annual low is 21.5 °C (70.7 °F). August, the warmest month, has a mean of 28.3 °C (82.9 °F) and an average high of 33.8 °C (92.8 °F), while the coolest month, January, has a mean of 24.8 °C (76.6 °F) and an average low of 20.3 °C (68.5 °F), although February has a lower average low at 20.0 °C (68.0 °F).\\n\nOn July 2, 1996, the Isla de Mona recorded a temperature of 40.0 °C (104.0 °F), which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nIsla de Mona receives 986 millimetres (38.8 in) of precipitation annually over 126.5 precipitation days. Due to tropical cyclones , autumn is the wettest season, while winter is the driest. The wettest month is May, which receives 125 millimetres (4.9 in) of precipitation on average. October has 12.7 precipitation days on average, which is the highest of any month. January is the driest month, receiving 41 millimetres (1.6 in), while April has the least precipitation days (8.3).\\n\nFour types of land cover can be identified:  \\n\nMona Island hosts a large and increasing hawksbill sea turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) rookery with over 1,500 clutches laid annually on its beaches. The island is recognized as one of the principal sites for hawksbill nesting in the Wider Caribbean and Western Atlantic region, along with Mexico ( Yucatán Peninsula beaches), Barbados , Panama ( Bocas del Toro ), and Brazil.  \\n\nSoutheast beaches \\n\nSouthwest beaches \\n\nWestern beaches \\n\nThe only campsites are at Playa de Pájaros and Playa Sardinera . In addition, Playa Uveros, Pájaros, Playa Mujeres and Playa Brava are important to visitors.\\n\nMona Island today\nThe island presently serves as a retreat for Puerto Ricans and nature enthusiasts from all around the world, and has also become a popular destination for Puerto Rican Boy and Girl Scouts . Due to the islands\\' unique topography, ecology and location, Mona, Desecheo and Monito have been nicknamed \"The Galápagos Islands of the Caribbean\". Scientists, ecologists, and students have visited Mona Island to explore its distinct ecosystem, which includes the endemic Mona Ground Iguana . The island is also home to many cave drawings that were left behind by the island\\'s original inhabitants. Remains of the guano mining industry can also be seen.\\n\nAn FAA -certified airport that can handle small aircraft was built by the Puerto Rican government. This airport has no ICAO or IATA code. The United States Coast Guard is able to provide transportation with helicopter flights from Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla , to help with medicines and first aid equipment; they also fly whenever an emergency requiring hospitalization occurs. Private and commercial planes require a special permit issued by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources to use the airport\\'s facilities.\\n\nThe most common form of transportation is by private yacht, though commercial excursions are available from Cabo Rojo for small groups of up to twelve people traveling together.\\n\nHunting is permitted in season to control the population growth of non-indigenous species (goats and wild boars )  because they can represent a threat to various endangered species. The hunting season usually commences in December and ends in April. Camping is allowed from May through November.\\n\nIn recent years, the island has become a major drop-off point especially for Dominicans , as well as Haitians and Cubans trying to reach Puerto Rico illegally. As a U.S. Commonwealth , Puerto Rico is seen by many undocumented migrants as a stepping stone to the United States, but they are usually deported immediately.  \\n\nDue to the island\\'s natural and cultural importance there has been interest in seeking world heritage status for Mona as a UNESCO World Heritage Site by the Puerto Rican government.  \\n\nGallery\nScenes around Isla de Mona:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The island is a popular spot for snorkeling and bathing .\\n\nHistory\nThe island was originally known as Piñas , Piñero Island, or Pineapple Island .  In the past, the island was used to cultivate pineapple and sugar cane crops.  Later on for years the island was abandoned and was practically a dumpster, because of which the residents of Joyuda began referring to it as Isla de los Ratones , ( transl. Island of Mice ) because of the amount of rodents that inhabited the island.  \\n\nDuring half of the twentieth century, the then owner of the Cerveceria India , Don Alfonso Valdés Cobián was one of the people in charge of the Island.  During this time he began cleaning up the small isle.  \\n\nIn 1988, the island was sold to MTV , who organized a fantasy island sweepstakes promoted by Cyndi Lauper . After several protests, nothing more was heard from MTV.  \\n\nNow, the custodians of the island are the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA) and Tourmarine, a private tourist company.  They have a cooperative agreement to help in the cleaning and trash collecting because of the DRNA lack of personnel.  \\n\nAs part of the annual Tríalo de Joyuda en Cabo Rojo or Joyuda Triathlon in Cabo Rojo, one leg of the event consist of reaching the island and returning.  \\n\nRestoration\nIn 2005, Caborrojeños Pro Salud y Ambiente , an environmentalist organization undertook a restoration project on the island\\'s north shore to try to stop erosion and sedimentation that is threatening the coral reef and mangrove forest that used to surround the island.  The island has lost approximately 45 percent of its area over the past 60 years due to coral bleaching , disease, and destruction of reefs by wave force and currents.  In 2006, the Inter American University of Puerto Rico received grant from NOAA and the Gulf of Mexico Foundation to implement a second phase of the restoration project.  Students, professors and members of Caborrojeños Pro Salud y Ambiente, under the direction of the DRNA, planted some 400 floating seeds of red mangrove that forms part of the ecological inventory that surrounds the island.  Approximately 0.25 acres (0.10 ha) of mangrove habitat was restored and 0.0091 acres (0.0037 ha) of artificial reef was created.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°06\\xe2\\x80\\xb259.84\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 67°11\\xe2\\x80\\xb218.00\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.1166222°N 67.1883333°W ﻿ / 18.1166222; -67.1883333 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nIsla Verde, Puerto Rico\nIsla Verde ( Spanish for \\'\\'green island\\'\\') is a beach-front , urbanized area in the barrio of Cangrejo Arriba in the municipality of Carolina where the main airport of Puerto Rico , Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU) , is located. It is Immediately east of the barrio of Santurce in the capital municipality of San Juan , Los Corozos and San José Lagoon , and Teodoro Moscoso Bridge , which connects the coastal area to Hato Rey , the commercial and financial center in the metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, and west of the Laguna La Torrecilla (La Torrecilla Lagoon), and the state forest and beaches of the Piñones community in the barrio of Torrecilla Baja in the municipality of Loíza . Isla Verde is home to various upscale hotels and apartments. \\n\nGeolocation\nIsla Verde is also the name of the small island some 400 meters north of Punta Medio, with a size of just 2,518 m 2 (0.6 acres). It is the island that gave name to the district. The island falls within the Cangrejo Arriba barrio of Carolina. The district of Isla Verde is in fact the coastal area of Cangrejo Arriba. Isla Verde is bordered to the north by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west by the San Juan area of Punta las Marias and Ocean Park ( Santurce ), to the east by Loíza and to the south by Carolina and Rio Piedras ( San Juan ). Isla Verde, along with Condado , is one of the main tourist areas in the metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, hosting popular restaurants, hotels, casinos and resorts.    \\n\nNeighborhood entanglements\nThe Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport , which many people mistakenly think is situated in San Juan, is located in Isla Verde,  which belongs to the city of Carolina. For almost four years, the airport was given the unofficial title \"Isla Verde International Airport\", both by locals and visitors. Its residents tend to downplay the fact that the area is technically part of Carolina because Isla Verde shares the coastline with Ocean park and Condado which are both nearby and part of Santurce, one of the capital\\'s historic districts.\\n\nSince the airport\\'s creation and up until the September 11, 2001 attacks , aviation fans could enjoy a day at the beach, and at the same time, watch the aircraft land or take-off at a specially designed spot located near Piñones, Loíza. As a consequence of the attacks, the spot was closed to the general public because it might compromise airport security. Because of the airport\\'s location in the Isla Verde area, some streets have had to be closed several times during visits by dignitaries and celebrities (most notably when a local has had overseas success in a competition). The area has a multitude of restaurants, hotels and high-priced homes as well as hotels and resorts.\\n\nMany celebrities have lived in Isla Verde\\'s affluent areas, including some former members of the boy band Menudo , including Ricky Martin . During the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was home to one of the world\\'s more popular discos of the time: The Flying Sauce, owned by Charlie Garcia who had promoted the Muhammad Ali vs. Jean Pierre Coopman fight at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum. The Flying Saucer had a capacity of 800 people and over 10,000 were left outside opening night as DJ Orlando Torres del Pino had to force himself into the club. Isla Verde is home to a large Cuban exile community centered on Casa Cuba, which is Puerto Rico\\'s main Cuban social club.\\n\nThe Isla Verde bus terminal has routes to various other parts of San Juan:\\n\nThere are two bus systems serving the Isla Verde bus terminal: AMA, the main public transportation system  and SITRAC which travels in the Isla Verde Hotel district.  The public bus 5 and 53 which will take you from the Bus Terminal to Old San Juan (e.g. to El Morro ) in roughly 1 hour. \\nThe SITRAC bus is free but only stays in Isla Verde. The public bus costs 75 cents to ride.\\n\nAvailable at all times, taxis charge about $20 for a ride to the Condado and Old San Juan areas.  \\n\nSubareas\nIsla Verde has very wealthy areas but is not too far from the island\\'s largest public housing project, Luis Llorens Torres Residential Complex, which is actually within San Juan.  In March 2021, a higher police presence was planned for Isla Verde.   \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

According to data collected, more than 80,000 residents of Puerto Rico use the bridge. It is the first Cable-stayed bridge in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.   Puerto Rico is an area of moderate to high seismic activity. The bridge was designed using an AASHTO response spectrum (Soil Profile Type I and an Acceleration Coefficient of 0.20g). All major bridge members were required to remain elastic for the design level earthquake and ductile detailing in accordance with AASHTO Seismic Performance Category C was provided in all potential plastic hinge regions.\\n\nPPD Governor Anibal Acevedo Vila led the opening ceremony of the project on October 24, 2008.  The total cost of the project was $31 million which came from local and federal funds.  The bridge (including approach spans) is 703 meters long.  The cable stayed portion is supported by two hollow diamond-shaped towers and 96 stay.  The total cable stayed supported length is 315 meters with a main span over La Plata river of 157.5 meters.\\n\nThe bridge is now restricted to two lanes to minimize impact loads on the cable stayed system. These impact loads are generated when traveling trucks bounce on the bridge deck due to the bumpiness of the concrete surface. The bumpiness of the bridge deck was the result of poor judgement by consultants during the construction of the cast-in-place bridge deck. This structural condition is fixable.\\n\nThe design of the Jesús Izcoa Moure Bridge was carried out by a joint venture between CSA and HNTB . The inspection during construction was performed by a firm named Edwards and Kelcey managed at the time by Eng. Ralph Burrington.  The cable stayed system was provided by Dywidag Systems International.\\n\nThe Jesús Izcoa Moure Bridge served to educate young engineers and received multiple visits coordinated by the mayor of Naranjito at the time (Manolo Ortega), the Secretary of Transportation (Fernando Fagundo), the Director of Highway Authority (Tomas Montalvo) and local engineering universities. The bridge was built mainly by local workers. About 80% of the work force was from Naranjito , Barranquitas and Bayamón .\\n\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nJose V. Toledo Federal Building and United States Courthouse\nThe Jose V. Toledo Federal Building and United States Courthouse is a historic post office and courthouse located at Old San Juan , Puerto Rico . It is a courthouse for the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico . It is also the site for oral argument before the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit , when that court sits in Puerto Rico.\\n\nBuilding history\nThe courthouse was designed to provide suitable accommodations for important government offices and to demonstrate the commitment of the United States to the Island of Puerto Rico. From the initial settlement of San Juan, this harbor side site has been critical to the city\\'s defense and economic development. Initially, portions of the site contained a Spanish fortification, the Bastion de San Justo del Muelle , which was built in 1639 (shortly after the city was invaded by the Dutch) and remained in place until 1897. The southern portion of the site contained a building that was likely a Spanish custom house constructed during the 1830s.  \\n\nIn 1898, the U.S. Government took possession of Puerto Rico and established a presence on the island. When the United States established a governance structure for Puerto Rico in 1900, the need for public buildings became apparent.  \\n\nThe structure is composed of two distinct but connected buildings. The first building of the complex was designed between 1906 and 1908 by the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Department of the Treasury, led by James Knox Taylor . Constructed between 1911 and 1914, it was the island\\'s first significant federal building. In 1936, an addition was proposed to accommodate New Deal programs created in response to the Great Depression. Congress authorized the expansion the same year, and plans were completed by the Department of the Treasury\\'s Public Buildings Branch under Supervising Architect Louis A. Simon in 1938. Construction of the addition was completed in 1940. It is a substantial building that was designed independently of the earlier building, although the two are physically connected on the south facade of the 1914 building.   \\n\nIn 1986 the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.  In 1999 the building was renamed for Jose Victor Toledo . Toledo (1931-1980) served as a justice and chief judge in the U.S. District Court, District of Puerto Rico, from 1970 until his death a decade later.  \\n\nArchitecture\nThe three-story, 1914 section of the courthouse displays a sophisticated and harmonious blend of the Spanish Colonial Revival style with classically inspired forms and details that reflect both the indigenous architecture of Puerto Rico and the prevalent style used on federal government buildings of the era.  \\n\nThe U-shaped structure sits on a foundation of concrete piers and wood piles. Constructed on a site that slopes north to south toward the harbor, it consists of a partially excavated basement, two floors with loggias , and a set-back third floor capped with a Spanish-tile roof.  \\n\nThe raised basement is finished with rusticated granite , while the upper floors are constructed of brick and concrete and finished in stucco . The north elevation features a centrally placed, projecting, multi-curved parapet and flanking entry portals. The loggias , hallmarks of the Spanish Colonial Revival Style, provide ventilation and shelter from the weather. The openings are segmentally arched with projecting keystones topping the openings. Classically inspired pilasters divide the openings and are skillfully combined with wrought-iron balusters that are located on the second level. Windows are covered with wrought-iron grilles. The clay tile roof with wide overhanging eaves reflects indigenous architectural influence. Supported by paired brackets and set over the building\\'s ornamental cornice, the eaves provide relief from the hot sun and protect the building from rain.  \\n\nThe 1940 building connects with the earlier building on the south elevation. It covers the building\\'s original grand terraced harbor side entrance and most of its main facade. The simple Streamline Moderne -Art Moderne tower is characteristic of much government architecture of the late 1930s. It contains minimal decorative detailing, but its massing contributes strongly to the building\\'s visual prominence. Rectangular in plan and six stories in height, the 1940 building is constructed of cast-in-place, reinforced concrete. Two towers capped with handsome, four-ton, bronze lanterns, flank the building and extend above the six-story main edifice.  \\n\nSignificant interior spaces of the Jose V. Toledo Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse include, in the 1914 building, a marble-trimmed entrance lobby with a Spanish-inspired white marble imperial staircase, and public corridors of salt-glazed brick with cast-iron ventilator grilles designed to keep the building comfortable in the tropical Puerto Rican climate. The 1940 addition includes a fifth-floor ceremonial courtroom with decorative tile wainscoting and a diamond-pattern cornice. Original 1940s furnishings have been recreated.  \\n\nIn 1996 the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) commenced a meticulous restoration following the recovery of approximately 16,000 artifacts that were discovered during preliminary archaeological work on the site. The exterior was restored to its 1940 appearance. Historically significant areas were identified for restoration or replacement. The second-story loggia, closed in the late 1940s or early 1950s, was reopened. The six-foot eaves, removed in 1958, were reconstructed. Original ceremonial spaces were restored. The building was reinforced to withstand earthquakes. Wherever possible, original architectural materials were reused rather than replaced, preserving the integrity of the building.  \\n\nIn March 2000 the Society for History in the Federal Government awarded the John Wesley Powell Prize for Excellence in Historic Preservation to GSA for the rehabilitation and restoration work conducted at the building. In 2002 the project received two awards: the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Chairman\\'s Award for outstanding federal preservation achievement, and the American Institute of Architects New England Charter\\'s Honor Award.  \\n\nIn 2009, GSA began remodeling of the postal spaces for the bankruptcy court support activities and judges chambers, using the architectural firm Perkins Eastman of Pittsburgh and the construction firm Fe-Ri Construction of San Juan.\\n\nSignificant events\nBuilding facts\nSee also\nReferences\nAttribution"

Known as the father of the statehood movement in Puerto Rico ,  Barbosa was the first Puerto Rican, and one of the first persons of African descent to earn a medical degree in the United States .  \\n\nAfter his return to the island in 1880, Barbosa made many contributions to medicine and public health. He initiated an early form of health insurance, encouraging employers to pay a fee to cover future needs of their employees. In 1900 Barbosa was among the first five Puerto Rican leaders appointed to the Executive Cabinet under Governor Charles H. Allen , in the first civilian government organized by the United States. He served in the Cabinet until 1917. From 1917 to 1921, Barbosa served in the first elected Puerto Rican Senate .\\n\nEarly years\nBarbosa was born in 1857 in the city of Bayamón , Puerto Rico to parents of African and European ancestry. He received both his primary and secondary education in Puerto Rico. He was the first person of African ancestry to attend Puerto Rico\\'s prestigious Jesuit Seminary. After graduating from the seminary, Barbosa tutored private students to save money to attend college. In 1875, he moved to New York City to attend prep school, where he learned English in a year.  \\n\nEducation\nOriginally Barbosa wished to become a lawyer, but after he suffered a bout of pneumonia in New York City , his doctor recommended that he study medicine. In 1877 he applied but was denied admission to the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, due to his race.  He then applied and was admitted to the medical school of the University of Michigan , where he graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1880. Barbosa was the first person from Puerto Rico to earn a medical degree in the United States.  He returned to Puerto Rico, where he set up a practice in his hometown of Bayamón.  \\n\nThe Spanish colonial government initially did not recognize Barbosa\\'s medical degree, as it was not from a known European university. The American consul to the island intervened on behalf of Barbosa to have his United States degree recognized, so that he could practice.  \\n\nBarbosa provided medical care all over the island. He introduced the novel idea of employers paying a fee for the future healthcare needs of their employees (a very early health insurance system). In 1893, Barbosa founded the first Puerto Rican cooperative and named it El Ahorro Colectivo.  \\n\nPolitical career\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, Barbosa was a member of the Partido Autonomista Puro (Pure Autonomous Party), also known as \"Partido Histórico\" and \"Partido Ortodoxo\", led by Román Baldorioty de Castro , but left because of ideological differences.  \\n\nIn 1898, when the United States bombarded and blockaded San Juan during the Spanish-American War , Barbosa and other doctors who lived in Bayamón traveled to the town of Cataño and took a ferry to the capital. Barbosa, as a member of the Red Cross , went to the aid of the wounded Puerto Rican and Spanish soldiers. He and his party on the ferry had to travel across San Juan Bay at risk, as they were under cannon fire. Barbosa and those with him were recommended by the Spanish government for the Cruz de la Orden del Mérito Naval (The Cross of the Order of Naval Merit) for their bravery.  \\n\nAs a result of the war, the United States made Puerto Rico one of its territories. On July 4, 1899, Barbosa formed the pro-statehood Partido Republicano de Puerto Rico . He became known as the father of the statehood for Puerto Rico movement.  \\n\nLater years\nOn June 5, 1900, President William McKinley named Barbosa, together with Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón , José de Diego , Manuel Camuñas and Andrés Crosas, as part of an Executive Cabinet under U.S.-appointed Governor Charles H. Allen , the first civilian governor of the island. The Executive Cabinet also included six American members.  Barbosa served on the Executive Cabinet until 1917, dealing with a variety of governors appointed by the US during that period, and providing continuity in administration.  \\n\nDuring this period, in 1907 he founded the newspaper El Tiempo , the first bilingual newspaper published on the island.  \\n\nWith representative elections authorized in 1917, Barbosa ran for an at-large seat. He was elected, serving as a member of the first Puerto Rican Senate , from 1917 to 1921.  \\n\nJosé Celso Barbosa died in San Juan on September 21, 1921. He was buried in Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in Old San Juan . One of his daughters, Pilar Barbosa , became a historian, serving as the Official Historian of Puerto Rico from 1993 to 1997. She was also a political activist who carried on her father\\'s work.   \\n\nLegacy and honors\nDescendants\nBarbosa had twelve children including, Roberto C. Barbosa who became a dentist, Guillermo H. Barbosa, who became a surgeon and Pilar Barbosa de Rosario , who became Puerto Ricos first female official historian and married José Ezequiel Rosario. His cousin Jesus, gave birth to Oddosia \"Thea\" Barbosa. \\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

It has consistently been ranked among the highest ticket-selling venues globally.   \\n\nThe coliseum opened on September 4, 2004 after a prolonged construction financed by the Government of Puerto Rico . This venue is owned by the Puerto Rico Convention District Authority, a public corporation of Puerto Rico , and managed by ASM Global .   It can accommodate up to 18,500 spectators and can be reached by the Hato Rey Station of the Tren Urbano system.\\n\nThe arena hosted the first WWE pay-per-view event outside the continental United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, since SummerSlam 1992 when New Year\\'s Revolution was held there in 2005. On May 26, 2011, the arena was ranked 8th on the Top 50 Arena Venues of the world and second of the West Hemisphere in worldwide ticket sales by Pollstar . As of May 2013, the arena has received over 5 million spectators, hosting more than 600 events with a gross ticket revenue around $200 million.\\n\nAfter the hit from Hurricane Maria , in the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , events after mid-September 2017 were cancelled. For a while, the Choliseo was used as a warehouse and recollection center by the Government of Puerto Rico to prepare and distribute food, water and basic necessities to those affected by the deadliest and costliest hurricane in Puerto Rican history. The arena resumed hosting events in March 2018.\\n\nHistory\nThe Coliseum was a project started during the administration of Governor Rafael Hernández Colón , initially as part of a bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games . [ citation needed ] The facility was supposed to be constructed between the Roberto Clemente Coliseum and Hiram Bithorn Stadium , about a mile and a half away from the current arena site. The Coliseum would have been used for events such as Gymnastics and Olympic Basketball had the games been held in San Juan.\\n\nHowever, in 1997 the International Olympic Committee selected Athens to host the Olympics and the construction of the Coliseum was jeopardized. Recognizing the need for such a facility anyway, the government decided to continue the construction, this time at a site physically close to San Juan\\'s financial district, the Golden Mile . Since the new site was adjacent to a future Tren Urbano station, the Coliseum\\'s planners decided not to incorporate parking facilities to the arena, as to induce visitors to use mass transportation to reach it. [ citation needed ] \\n\nPolitical opponents of Pedro Rosselló \\'s administration raised various objections to the original plan, claiming that the lot of land purchased for the construction would benefit some of his political party\\'s ( PNP ) heaviest financial contributors. They also objected to the lack of parking space, claiming that nearby private parking operators, supposedly also money donors to Rosselló\\'s party, would extort high parking fees from people who could not or would not use public transportation to the venue. At the time, the Tren Urbano was in its initial stages of construction; by the time the facility opened it was still under construction. Objectors would also point out that a private operator would take control of the facility under contract from the government of Puerto Rico under what was perceived as a highly expensive contract. The Rosselló administration countered by stating that previous experience with public sports facilities in Puerto Rico, which would quickly fall into disrepair at an accelerated rate requiring constant remodeling, demanded that a private entity should manage the facility. The contract\\'s expense would be justified by bringing in an operating partner with international experience managing world-class facilities, whose reputation would ensure that performers and sport events that had never been staged in Puerto Rico could visit the island. [ citation needed ] \\n\nThe Coliseum\\'s construction was stopped for close to two years during the administration of governor Sila María Calderón , the leader of the opposition party ( PPD ) whose administration followed Rosselló\\'s. She claimed that the Puerto Rican government had spent $242 million for a facility where only 42% of its scheduled project plan had been completed when she took office. The planners and constructors had overlooked the fact that a water pumping station next to the facility had been built over unstable land, and a portion of the building\\'s foundations would have had to be redone because of this. There was even talk of demolishing what had been built and starting from scratch, which infuriated Rosselló supporters, who dismissed the suggestion as merely an excuse to spend more government money, this time to benefit the PPD\\'s financial backers. Plans for a redesigned interior added during the Calderón administration added fuel to the intense public controversy. [ citation needed ] \\n\nAnother controversy came about when Banco Popular \\'s subsidiary Ticketpop was named the ticketing distributor through an exclusive contract, almost ignoring the bid by competitor TicketCenter. Ticketpop remained the sole ticketing distributor, from the venue\\'s opening day until August 28, 2019 when rising competitor Ticketera was given the exclusive contract;  Ticketpop\\'s entire subsidiary operations were later sold to Ticketera in April 2021, whose founders also founded Ticketpop.  \\n\nThe original ticket vendor bidding controversy almost went to trial, as both parties argued over who would receive the contract, but the Government of Puerto Rico stood by their original contract with Ticketpop. Local producer Angelo Medina spearheaded a group that wanted the legislature to curb the managing powers of SMG (before merging to ASM Global in 2019), recently-named to oversee operations and activities, because they feared that the company\\'s relationship with non-local television companies would limit the participation of local talent in the arena. [ citation needed ] \\n\nThe Coliseum was finally inaugurated on September 4, 2004. The first major show was Van Halen , on September 13, 2004.\\n\nThe naming of the structure caused a controversy by itself. During the construction phase, plans called for the coliseum to be named simply El Coliseo de Puerto Rico (The Coliseum of Puerto Rico). It was also suggested to have a private entity sponsor the facility and lend its name to it. Most local politicians objected to the idea, due to the 2001 Enron financial scandal , which made the company go bankrupt at a time when their corporate sponsorship named the Houston Astros \\' home ballpark as the Enron Field.\\n\nSome politicians argued over the naming the Coliseum after a Puerto Rican celebrity. Some of the names mentioned were that of pop star Chayanne , boxer Félix \"Tito\" Trinidad and actor Raúl Juliá . Puerto Rican law demanded that no facility could be named after a living individual and there were talks of making an exception to the law should a living Puerto Rican icon be honored with the name. However, the name of beloved local comedian José Miguel Agrelot was chosen when the Coliseum was near its completion. Agrelot himself had suggested the name of Rafael Hernández Marín to be used, and when someone suggested his name instead he was both surprised and concerned. [ citation needed ] \\n\nParking and transportation\nA major public parking space or garage was not included in the planning or construction for the arena. Instead, only three parking lots were constructed, one for backstage entrance for authorized talent, production, equipment, props, etc., a medium-sized lot to the West entrance mostly for handicapped and the smallest lot, access-controlled, located across the box office and nearby the heavy rail station; privately-owned parking lots around the Choliseo can be found and charge a fee. The Tren Urbano is by far the most used transportation mode to and from the Choliseo ; the Hato Rey station , located at a short walking distance, is the only station to extend operating hours after nighttime events end until all passengers using the system have exited at the station of their respective destinations.\\n\nAwards and recognitions\nOn May 26, 2011, the Coliseo was ranked 8th on the Top 50 Arena Venues of the world and second of the West Hemisphere in worldwide ticket sales by Pollstar , surpassing the Staples Center in Los Angeles, the American Airlines Arena in Miami , Wembley Arena in London, etc. In the first three months of 2011, the coliseum received an overwhelming number of people of over 205,000. During the first trimester, the coliseum was ranked 13 times in the 25 best arenas worldwide, according to Pollstar , Billboard and Venues Today .  \\n\nNotable events held at the venue\nThe largest attendance record that the Choliseo has hosted was achieved on July 28, 2022, with Bad Bunny \\'s Un Verano Sin Ti. The singer established an all-time record of 18,749 spectators, 249 spectators over the venue\\'s capacity, on the first night of his three-night performances, breaking a previous record that was also achieved by him in 2019.  This was the first time a concert was fully broadcast live on national television in Puerto Rico, which was exclusively through the airwaves of Telemundo Puerto Rico . Wisin & Yandel hold various records, some of which they have previously broken as well, including most performances at the Choliseo , by any artist, duo or group, increasing it to 39 and largest number of shows sold out in 24 hours. Their farewell concert tour, La \\xc3\\x9altima Misión World Tour , spun a 14-date run for the entire month of December 2022, a record previously held by Daddy Yankee , who had a 12-date run, December 2019.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nJoyuda, Puerto Rico\nJoyuda is a quiet coastal fishing village in western Puerto Rico , located between the cities of Mayagüez and Cabo Rojo , known for its seafood and snorkeling and seafood restaurants.    \\n\nLocation\nThough Joyuda is easy to access from Mayagüez, the neighborhood belongs to the barrio Miradero in the municipality of Cabo Rojo. A chain of fishing hamlets, mini-docks and wooden homes raised above water on stilts, occupies the mile-long portion of the road P.R. 102 that borders the sea, just along the Joyuda Cove . At its north, runs the Guanajibo River , also known as Pirate River for \"stealing the waters of rivers that ran south.\" Closer yet lies the bioluminescent  saltwater Joyuda Lagoon , a natural preserve and a bird sanctuary with an extensive mangrove forest and more than 40 sorts of fish. Slightly to the west, off the coast and toward the Mona Passage is another natural preserve. Within a stone\\'s throw, emerges Mice Cay , a Brown pelican nesting grounds, an islet covered with Australian pines and bordered by sandy beaches.\\n\nHistory\nJoyuda should be one of the few coastal settlements in western Puerto Rico to forgo claims of Christopher Columbus landing. Though the nearby path, \"Camino el Indio\" (en: Indian Way), may elicit visions of a rich indigenous past, little surfaces, in fact, from colonial sources about Joyuda, but until the 19th century. With the sharp population growth that followed the Spanish American wars of independence and the resulting migration of loyalist creoles to the island, Joyuda made a definitive appearance on the map. Even foreign publications refer to 19th century Joyuda as a fishing center, flanked by sugarcane fields, watered by the Guanajibo watershed. One Spanish source describes the Mouse Cay as larger and nearer to the coast than what is today. Pineapple and sugarcane grew on it, which explains its earlier name of Cay of Pineapples .\\n\nAmong the flurry of English-language publications about Puerto Rico that rolled out of New York presses in the wake of the Spanish-American War, Joyuda turns up commonly as a point of geo-reference. Scientists suddenly were paying attention to the Joyuda Lagoon, particularly those from the College of Agriculture, today\\'s Mayagüez campus of the University of Puerto Rico. Even a coconut-cultivation business grew around it, cutting the extent of the mangrove forest drastically. The fishing community, however, continued to make little noise. Only its food, especially homemade meals prepared with shellfish, crab and fish, was making waves. It began in the 1940s with a trickle. From nearby U.S. companies in Mayagüez, came a steady dribble of customers who could afford to take the 15-minute drive over the new road and across the river and lagoon to eat \"genuine\" Puerto Rican food. In the 1950s, Mayagüez suburbs, like the Guanajibo Homes, developed toward the coast and contiguous to Joyuda.\\n\nGallery\nPlaces in Joyuda:\\n\nSee also\nReferences"

He was of predominant African ancestry and of partial Italian ancestry through his mother. He took his elementary studies in Dorado. After that, he followed studies in the nearby town of Toa Baja . During weekends, he worked as a mason and carpenter to pay for his studies. He finished his studies at Central High School in Santurce in 1923.  \\n\nAt this time, his family moved to the town of Cataño and he started studies in the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras . He received his bachelor\\'s degree as a teacher of industrial arts , drawing , and carpentry . After several years working in several places, he started working as a teacher in 1937 at a school in San Germán . From there, he was transferred to another school in Canóvanas .\\n\nIn 1941, Juan Boria married Emérita Rodríguez with whom he had a daughter named: Zayda. From his first marriage, he already had a daughter named: Cruz Amanda.\\n\nIn 1938, during a show at the school in Canóvanas, he heard a colleague — Pablito Rivera — recite the Negro poem \"La negra curandera.\" He liked it so much that he asked him for a copy to learn and recite at his friends meetings. After some time, his friends prompted him to participate in a program at the WKAQ radio station. The poet Fortunato Vizcarrondo, considered the most important Negro poet in the island at the time, heard him and visited him. Vizcarrondo then offered him other of his poems for him to recite at the program.\\n\nIn 1941, he participated in a show at Loíza , where he met the most important personality in Puerto Rican show-business, Ramón Rivero (known as \"Diplo\"), who was so impressed with Boria\\'s performance that he made Boria part of his troupe called La Farándula Bohemia , traveling the island and performing as a poet and as an actor. In 1944, Boria once more joined the famous troupe and accompanied Ramón Rivero (Diplo) to the Panama Canal to entertain Puerto Rican soldiers stationed there.\\n\nIn 1950, he traveled to Havana, Cuba under the recommendation of \"Diplo\" and Luis Palés Matos . He planned to stay there for 15 days but was so sought after that he ended up staying two months. He followed with travels to the Dominican Republic , Colombia , Venezuela , Spain, and Portugal, as well as New York, where he headlined at the Teatro Puerto Rico , and other cities in the United States. Afterward, he alternated his artistic activities with his job as a teacher in Río Piedras .\\n\nIn 1954, Boria debuted in television on the show Tribuna del Arte from Telemundo . He also performed in La Taberna India with \"Diplo.\" He followed with his debut in film in 1964 in the Mexican / Puerto Rican film Mientras Puerto Rico duerme , directed by Julián Soler. He also appeared in several short films produced by the Division of Community Education.\\n\nFrom 1965 he traveled several cultural centers, schools, and public squares in Puerto Rico reciting at events sponsored by the Puerto Rican Culture Institute. He also participated at the Cultural Olympics in 1979.\\n\nIn October, 1980, the 7th Festival of Bomba y Plena celebrated in his hometown of Dorado was dedicated to him. Also, the show Nuestra Noche that same year was held in his honor. The show was celebrated in the Roberto Clemente Coliseum and featured singers like Wilkins , Haciendo Punto en Otro Son , and others.\\n\nIn 1983, the mayor of Dorado, Alfonso López Chaar, acquired the Juana de Arco Theater at the entrance of the town and renamed it as Juan Boria Theater. On November 1, 1984, Boria himself presented his first show at the theater.\\n\nBoria retired from teaching in 1974. Afterward, he started his own shop in Cupey .\\n\nBoria died May 29, 1995, in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico .\\n\nInfluences\nAlthough he identified with the works of Vizcarrondo, Palés Matos and Nicolás Guillén , his repertoire included poems from:\\n\nDiscography\nReferences\nSee also"

        "page_content": "Contents\nJulia de Burgos\n\\n\nJulia Constanza Burgos García (February 17, 1914 - July 6, 1953), also known as Julia de Burgos, was a Puerto Rican poet, journalist, and teacher.  As an advocate of Puerto Rican independence , she served as Secretary General of the Daughters of Freedom, the women\\'s branch of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party .  She was also a civil rights activist for women and African and Afro-Caribbean writers.\\n\nEarly years\nJulia de Burgos (birth name: Julia Constanza Burgos García ) was born to Francisco Burgos Hans, a farmer, and Paula García de Burgos.  Her father was a member of the Puerto Rico National Guard and had a farm near the town of Carolina, Puerto Rico , where she was born. The family later moved to the barrio of Santa Cruz of the same city. She was the oldest of thirteen children. Six of her younger siblings died of malnutrition. Her first work was Río Grande de Loíza .  \\n\nAfter Burgos graduated from Muñoz Rivera Primary School in 1928, her family moved to Rio Piedras , where she was awarded a scholarship to attend University High School .  In 1931, she enrolled in University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus to become a teacher.\\n\nIn 1933, at the age of 19, Burgos graduated from the University of Puerto Rico with a degree in teaching. She became a teacher and taught at Feijoo Elementary School in Barrio Cedro Arriba of Naranjito, Puerto Rico . She also worked as writer for a children\\'s program on public radio , but was reportedly fired for her political beliefs.  Among her early influences were Luis Lloréns Torres , Mercedes Negrón Muñoz , Rafael Alberti and Pablo Neruda . According to Burgos, \"My childhood was all a poem in the river, and a river in the poem of my first dreams.\"  \\n\nNationalism\nIn 1934, Burgos married Ruben Rodriguez Beauchamp and ended her teaching career. In 1936, she became a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party (Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico), led by Pedro Albizu Campos . She was elected to the position of Secretary General of the Daughters of Freedom, the women\\'s branch of the party.  She divorced her husband in 1937.\\n\nLiterature\nBy the early 1930s, Burgos had published her work in journals and newspapers. She published two collections of poetry, Poema en 20 surcos (1938) and Canción de la verdad sencilla (1939) in her lifetime. Her third collection, El mar y tú: otros poemas (1954) was edited and published after her death by her sister, Consuelo Burgos.  For her first two books, she traveled around the island promoting her work by giving book readings.  Her third book was published posthumously in 1954. Burgos\\' lyrical poems are a combination of the intimate, the land and the social struggle of the oppressed.  Many critics assert that her poetry anticipated the work of feminist writers and poets as well as that of other Hispanic authors .  In one of her poems, she writes: \"I am life, strength, woman.\"  Burgos received awards and recognition for her work and was celebrated by poets including Pablo Neruda , whom she met in Cuba, and stated that her calling was to be one of the greatest poet of the Americas.  \\n\nAmong Burgos\\' works are:\\n\nLater years\nLater in life, Burgos became romantically involved with Dr. Juan Isidro Jimenes Grullón , a Dominican physician. According to Grullón, many of her poems during that time were inspired by the love that she felt for him.  In 1940, Burgos and Jimenes Grullón traveled first to Cuba, where she briefly attended the University of Havana ,  and then later to New York City, where she worked as a journalist for Pueblos Hispanos , a progressive newspaper.\\n\nShortly after their arrival in Cuba, Burgos\\' relationship with Jimenes Grullón became strained.  After trying to save her relationship, she instead left and returned once again to New York in 1942, however this time alone, where she took menial jobs to support herself.  In 1944, she married Armando Marín, a musician from Vieques . In 1947, the marriage also ended in divorce, lapsing Burgos into further depression and alcoholism .\\n\nIt has to be from here, \\nright this instance, \\nmy cry into the world. \\nMy cry that is no more mine, \\nbut hers and his forever, \\nthe comrades of my silence, \\nthe phantoms of my grave.\\n\n \\n\nIn February 1953, Burgos wrote one of her last poems, \"Farewell in Welfare Island .\"   It was written during her last hospitalization and is believed by her peers to be one of the only poems she wrote in English. In the poem she foreshadows her death and reveals an ever darker concept of life.  \\n\nDeath\nOn June 28, 1953, Burgos left the home of a relative in Brooklyn , where she had been residing. [ citation needed ] She disappeared without leaving a clue as to where she went.  \\n\nIt was later discovered that in the early morning hours of July 5, 1953, she had collapsed on a sidewalk in the Spanish Harlem section of Manhattan , and she died of pneumonia at a hospital in Harlem shortly after midnight on July 6, 1953 at the age of 39. Since no one claimed her body and she had no identification on her, the city gave her a pauper\\'s burial on Hart Island , the city\\'s only potter\\'s field .  \\n\nEventually, some of her friends and relatives were able to trace her, find her grave, and claim her body. A committee was organized in Puerto Rico, presided over by Dr. Margot Arce de Vázquez , to have her remains transferred to the island. Burgos\\'s remains arrived on September 6, 1953 and funeral services for her were held at the Puerto Rican Atheneum .  She was given a hero\\'s burial at the Municipal Cemetery of Carolina.  A monument was later built at her burial site by the City of Carolina .  \\n\nHonors\nIn 1986, the Spanish Department of the University of Puerto Rico posthumously honored Burgos by granting her a doctorate in Human Arts and Letters.  \\n\nCities that have honored Burgos include:\\n\nThe Puerto Rican sculptor Tomás Batista sculpted a bust of de Burgos in the Julia de Burgos Park in Carolina. Isabel Cuchí Coll published a book about de Burgos titled Dos Poetisas de América: Clara Lair y Julia de Burgos . Puerto Rican poet Giannina Braschi , who was born the year of de Burgos\\' death, pays homage to her poetry and legend in the Spanglish novel Yo-Yo Boing!  \\n\nAt Yale University , the Latino Cultural Center is named in her honor, La Casa Cultural Julia de Burgos .\\n\nA documentary about the life of Burgos was made in 2002 titled \" Julia, Toda en mi ... \" ( Julia, All in me ... ) directed and produced by Ivonne Belén . Another biopic about her life, \"Vida y poesía de Julia de Burgos,\" was filmed and released in Puerto Rico in 1978.\\n\nIn New York City , the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, on 106th Street and Lexington Avenue, is named after her.  \\n\nOn September 14, 2010, in a ceremony held in San Juan , the United States Postal Service honored Burgos\\' life and literary work with the issuance of a first class postage stamp , the 26th release in the postal system\\'s Literary Arts series. The stamp\\'s portrait was created by Toronto -based artist Jody Hewgill.   \\n\nIn 2011, Burgos was inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame .\\n\nThere is a plaque, located at the monument to the Jayuya Uprising participants in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico , honoring the women of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Burgos\\' name is on the sixth line of the third plate.\\n\nOn May 29, 2014, The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored 12 illustrious women with plaques in the \"La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorriqueña\" (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women) in San Juan. According to the plaques each of the 12 women, who by virtue of their merits and legacies, stand out in the history of Puerto Rico. Burgos was among the 12 who were honored.  \\n\nIn September 2017, artist-activist Molly Crabapple (herself of Puerto Rican descent) disbursed the profits of the sales of her portrait of de Burgos to the Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria Recovery Fund. The giclée 17\\xe2\\x80\\xb3 x 22\\xe2\\x80\\xb3 print is captioned with one of the poet\\'s most famous lines: \"En todo me lo juego a ser lo que soy yo/I gamble everything to be what I am.\"  \\n\nIn 2018, the New York Times published a belated obituary for her as part of their Overlooked No More series.  \\n\nIn music\nThe third movement of Leonard Bernstein \\'s Songfest: A Cycle of American Poems for Six Singers and Orchestra is a setting of Burgos\\' poem \"A Julia de Burgos\". Jack Gottlieb wrote, \"In angry words (sung in Spanish) she expresses her defiance of the dual role she plays as a conventional woman and as a liberated woman-poet. (Her poem antedates by two decades the women\\'s liberation movement .) The music is sharply rhythmic, and might well be underscoring for a bullfight.\"\\n\nComposer Awilda Villarini set de Burgos\\' work to music in her composition \"Two Love Songs.\"  \\n\nPublications\nBiographical/Documentary films\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The name of the mall would then be changed to Las Catalinas.  \\n\nOn December 4, 1997, after development by Manley Berenson and Yebba Realty Ventures, Las Catalinas Mall officially opened with 80 stores and 3,000 parking spaces. It was anchored at the time by a Kmart Super Center and a Sears department store. It also featured a food court , \"El Trapiche.\" The mall was built with the purpose to serve the surrounding communities, but its variety of businesses lead it to become a regionally popular destination.   \\n\nOn November 4, 1998, Vornado Realty Trust bought Kmart\\'s 50% interest in the mall, forming a joint ownership between Vornado and Yebba Realty Ventures. In addition, Vornado acquired 75% and Yebba Realty Ventures acquired 25% of Kmart\\'s anchor store. Vornado\\'s total purchase price was about $38 million.  \\n\nBy the year 2000, the successful mall had over 100  tenants, including many popular businesses of American origin, such as 5-7-9 , Afterthoughts , Claire\\'s Boutique , Electronics Boutique , Footaction , Hallmark , KB Toys , Payless ShoeSource , RadioShack , Zales , and many others. The food court and restaurant options included El Mesón , Hot Potato, Howard Johnson\\'s , KFC , Quiznos , Taco Bell , Wetzel\\'s Pretzels , and more.   \\n\nAlso in the early 2000s, additional land was developed to open The Home Depot home improvement store and a Caribbean Cinemas theater. These additions complimented the mall\\'s variety, and would help to enhance the status of Las Catalinas as a top regional shopping destination.  \\n\nIn December 2001, Amigo Supermarkets announced that they would be opening a location at the mall by summer 2002.  \\n\nOn September 23, 2002, Vornado Realty Trust increased its interest in Las Catalinas to 100% by acquiring the other 50% of the mall from Yebba Realty Ventures and the 25% from the Kmart anchor store. The purchase price was approximately $48 million.  \\n\nIn 2010, an Adidas store and an iShop opened stores in the mall.\\n\nIn April 2012, it was announced that Best Buy , which was located on the premises of the mall, would be closing by mid-May 2012.  \\n\nIn January 2015, Vornado Realty Trust announced they would subsume some of their properties, including Las Catalinas, into a new company, Urban Edge Properties .  \\n\nIn July 2015, Sears Holdings reconfigured 235 of their properties, including the store at Las Catalinas, into Seritage Growth Properties .  \\n\nIn July 2015, a 13,773\\xc2\\xb2-foot Forever 21 clothing store opened at the mall, the chain\\'s fifth store on the island, at the time.  \\n\nOn November 8, 2018, Sears Holdings announced that Kmart would be closing as part of a company-wide plan to shutter around 40 stores in the U.S. and P.R. The store officially closed on January 31, 2019.  \\n\nOn December 28, 2020, it was announced that Sears would also be closing in February 2021 as part of a company-wide plan to close 23 stores nationwide, leaving the mall temporarily with no anchor tenants.  \\n\nIn February 2021, it was announced that a 22,000\\xc2\\xb2-foot Coast Guard Exchange (CGX) would be opening in the former Office Depot space at the mall, scheduled to open by summer of that year.  \\n\nIn August 2021, it was announced that a Sector Sixty6 Entertainment Center and a Golden Corral restaurant would replace the former Kmart store. They were expected to open by 2022, but were delayed until summer 2023.  \\n\nIn August 2022, a 1,916\\xc2\\xb2-foot Tous store opened at the mall.  \\n\nIn June 2023, it was announced that both a 2,109\\xc2\\xb2-foot Hot Topic store, and a 5,520\\xc2\\xb2-foot Puma store would be coming to the mall. Hot Topic would open that month, being the chains 7th store on the island.  \\n\nOn August 21, 2023, the Golden Corral restaurant would open to much fanfare.  \\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Sector Sixty6, an entertainment center, taking up the space of the former Kmart at the mall, would officially debut at a cost of $22 million.   \\n\nOn November 9, 2023, it was announced by Urban Edge Properties (owners of Las Catalinas Mall) that, after 26 years, the center would be changing its name to the Shops@Caguas (the Shops at Caguas).  \\n\nOn December of 2023, the Amigo Supermarkets location at the mall suffered a small fire. No one was injured.  \\n\nOn May 2, 2024, it was reported that Ross Dress for Less would officially be opening at the mall, taking over the former space of the Sears store which sat vacant since 2021. Plans for Ross to officially debut on the island are scheduled for the beginning of 2025.  \\n\nCurrent Anchors\nFormer Anchors\nReferences"

The hotel was publicly owned, by the government of Puerto Rico, and managed by the US-based Associated Federal Hotels chain.  The main hotel building was designed by architects Osvaldo Toro and Miguel Ferrer, of the firm Toro Ferrer . The two men had previously designed the first modern luxury resort in San Juan, the Caribe Hilton . Another part of the complex, the seashell -inspired building for the restaurant La Perla , was designed by architect Mario Salvadori .  The hotel\\'s design incorporated tropical climate features such as cross-ventilation, natural illumination, open lobbies and seamless transitions between inside and outside spaces, with details supposedly relevant to Island traditions: an interior patio, blinds, a mirador encompassing both the sea and the city and the use of water throughout as a leitmotif. The protective concrete element in the fa\\xc3 7ade, called brise-soleil in French or \"quiebrasol\" in Spanish, is an architectural element used by famed architect Le Corbusier. The purpose of the \"quiebrasol\" is to filter the sun\\'s rays towards the interior corridors.\\n\nIn 1973, the La Concha Hotel was united with the adjacent Condado Beach Hotel into one hotel, known as the Hyatt Puerto Rico .  In 1976,  management of the complex was taken over by Hilton International  and the resort was renamed the Condado Beach La Concha Convention Center , with a huge convention wing built between the two existing hotel structures to physically connect them. The complex was later taken over by Carnival Cruise Line  and renamed The Condado Beach Trio , before the La Concha wing was closed in 1995, followed by the closure of the Condado Beach wing in 1997.  The government-owned properties sat vacant for years, and were finally severed in 2004. The convention center that joined them was demolished to build a public park.  \\n\nThe La Concha reopened in December 2007 after a $220 million renovation,  managed by Renaissance Hotels as La Concha Renaissance San Juan Resort .\\n\nIn the summer of 2010, the hotel opened a $100 million addition called The Suites Tower which features an atrium style building with one and two bedroom suites, kitchens, architectural lighting, and amenities. The hotel\\'s Casino del Mar is located on the street level of the new tower.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°27\\xe2\\x80\\xb226\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°04\\xe2\\x80\\xb226\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.45722°N 66.07389°W ﻿ / 18.45722; -66.07389 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nLa Cordillera Reef Nature Reserve\nThe La Cordillera Reef Nature Reserve , also known as the Reserva Natural Cayos de la Cordillera (Cordillera Cay Nature Reserve), is a nature reserve located 1.5 nautical miles off the coast of the barrio of Cabezas in the municipality of Fajardo in northeastern Puerto Rico . It consists of a small chain of cays , reefs , and islets , collectively known as La Cordillera (\\'\\'the mountain range\\'\\') or Cayos de la Cordillera (Cordillera Cays). From west to east, the archipelago comprises Las Cucarachas islets, Los Farallones islets, Icacos cay, Ratones cay, Lobos cay, Palominos island, Palominitos island, La Blanquilla cay and islets, Diablo cay, Hermanos reefs, and Barriles reefs. The nature reserve covers about 18 nautical miles and almost 30,000 acres between cape Las Cabezas de San Juan in Cabezas, Fajardo and the Spanish virgin island of Culebra .    \\n\nWith the exception of Palominos island and Lobos cay, which are privately owned, all cays , reefs , and islets in the small chain are protected by the marine reserve. The total land area of the reserve is 218 acres. The nature reserve is also important for local fishermen and eastern coastal municipalities, including Fajardo, Ceiba , and Naguabo , which depend on the reserve for their fishing industries.   \\n\nAlthough occasionally included as part of the reserve, the cays and reefs outside the chain that lie immediately next and parallel to the main coastline of Puerto Rico in Fajardo and Ceiba are not strictly protected by the reserve. From north to south, these are: Obispo cay, Zancudo cay, Roncador reef, Mata Caballos reef, Corona Carrillo reef, Ahogado cay, Ramos island, Largo cay, Piñeros island, Cabeza de Perro cay, Piñerito cay, Cabritas cay, and Cabras island.\\n\nHistory\nBefore its preservation, Icacos cay was important for the extraction of limestone for use in the sugarcane industry and construction in Puerto Rico. The conservation area that today encompasses the Cordillera Reef Nature Reserve was first designated on January 2, 1980, by the Coastal Zone Management Plan  with the goal of preserving the coral reefs and marine habitats surrounding the Cordillera Cays, a small reef archipelago consisting of cays such as Icacos cay, Ratones cay, Lobos cay, La Blanquilla reef, Diablo cay, and Palomino island. Other protected areas include Los Farallones , Barriles, and Hermanos reefs.  \\n\nAdministration over the nature reserve was transferred to the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA) in 1991. Management plans included the preservation of important bird nesting areas in some of the keys and the establishment of a marine wildlife refuge for the protection of endangered species such as green sea turtles and West Indian manatees.   The reserve is considered today a prime eco-tourist destination where visitors can swim along coral reefs and visit the beaches located in some of the cays, particularly Icacos .  \\n\nEcology\nSome of the marine ecosystems found within the reserve are coral reefs, sandy seashores, and extensive seagrass prairies which are important for sea turtles and manatees . La Cordillera Reef is also one of the largest preserved coral areas in the territory of Puerto Rico; the reefs are of high importance due to their high coverage of living coral. The three types of coral reef found in the reserve are rocky reef, consisting of coral growing on aeolianite and cemented sand, barrier reef, consisting of coral growing along keys and coastlines, and patch reef, consisting of patches of coral colonies growing on sandy seafloor. Some of the most common types of coral found in the area are Montastraea , Diploria , Acropora , Colpophyllia and Porites .   \\n\nThere are more than 83 documented fish species in the reserve, 33 of which are of importance for the regional fishing industry. The spiny lobster ( Panulirus argus ) and the queen conch ( Strombus gigas ) are also important species for fishing. The reserve also sustains keystone species that are responsible for important ecological processes such as \"reef cleaning\" which allows for the settlement, development and growth of new coral polyps; one of these keystone species is the black urchin ( Diadema antillarum ). In addition to the submerged fauna, this reserve is an important bird area with species such as the brown noddy ( Anous stolidus ), the bridled tern ( Sterna anaethetus ), the sooty tern ( Sterna fuscata ), the brown booby ( Sula leucogaster ), the laughing gull ( Larus atricilla ) and the roseate tern ( Sterna dougalli ), all of which are protected on the territorial and federal level. Humpback whales are also common throughout the winter months of December, January and February.  \\n\nThe most important flora in the reserve is the seagrass Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme , which form important seagrass prairies that sustain many marine species such as turtles and manatees. This ecosystem sustains one of the largest manatee populations in the archipelago of Puerto Rico.   \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

Located in the historical district of Old San Juan in the capital city of San Juan , it has served as the residence of the governor since the 16th century, making it the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the New World .  Built between 1533 and 1540 by orders of Charles I of Spain , the structure was the first fortification constructed by the Spanish on San Juan Islet to defend San Juan Bay , the harbor of Old San Juan . La fortaleza , alongside El Morro , San Cristóbal , El Cañuelo , and other forts part of the Walls of Old San Juan , protected strategically and militarily important Puerto Rico , or La Llave de las Indias (The Key to the Indies ) ,  from invasion by competing world powers and harassment by privateers and pirates during the Age of Sail .  It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983 as part of La Fortaleza and San Juan National Historic Site .  \\n\nThe structure\nLa Fortaleza was the first defensive fortification built in the historic city of Old San Juan, originally known as Ciudad de Puerto Rico (rich port city) , and the first of a series of military structures built to protect the city, which included the Castillo San Felipe del Morro and the Fort San Cristóbal . The construction was authorized by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor as a defense against attacks from Island Caribs and the European powers of the time.\\n\nInitially, the structure consisted of four walls enclosing an interior patio with a circular tower known as the Homage Tower . From the top of the tower, following military tradition, the governor would take fidelity oaths at critical moments to the King and Queen of Spain. Later, a second tower named the Austral Tower was constructed.\\n\nDuring the 1640 reconstruction, a chapel named after Santa Catalina Alejandría originally standing outside the fortification\\'s walls was integrated into the structure\\'s walls, resulting in the alternate name of Palacio de Santa Catalina (Saint Catherine\\'s Palace). \\n\nThe complex currently consists of a few attached buildings with formal living quarters on the second floor and private quarters on the third. It overlooks the high city walls that front the bay , and within the north perimeter of the house are sheltered gardens and a swimming pool.\\n\nHistory\nStarting in 1529, Governor La Gama petitioned the emperor on the need to build defensive fortifications \"because the island\\'s defenseless condition caused the people to emigrate.\"  Construction started in 1533, using stone, and concluded by 1540.  Yet the fort had no guns, and Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés commented, \"if it had been constructed by blind men could not have been located in a worse location.\"  Yet the structure has served as the governor\\'s residence since 1544.   \\n\nSince the 16th century, La Fortaleza has acted as the residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico, making it the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas.  The mansion was remodeled in 1846 by the Spanish authorities to adapt its military origin to its new purely administrative function.\\n\nLa Fortaleza has been captured three times by foreign powers:\\n\nIn 1834, Colonel George Dawson Flinter described the fortress of Santa Catalina as having a chapel, stables, cistern, and an east wing with spacious apartments.  \\n\nAccording to tradition, in 1898, just before the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War , the last Spanish governor of the island, Ricardo De Ortega , struck a longcase clock in La Fortaleza with his sword, stopping the clock and marking the time at which Spain lost control over Puerto Rico.\\n\nOn October 30, 1950, there was an attempt by a few nationalists to enter La Fortaleza in what is known as the San Juan Nationalist revolt , intending to attack then-governor Luis Muñoz Marín . The 5-minute shootout resulted in four Nationalists dead: Domingo Hiraldo Resto, Carlos Hiraldo Resto, Manuel Torres Medina, and Raímundo Díaz Pacheco. Three of the guards of the building, among them Lorenzo Ramos, were seriously injured.\\n\nOn October 9, 1960, La Fortaleza was designated a United States National Historic Landmark .   Teodoro Vidal , a cultural affairs official under Luis Muñoz Marín , organized renovation work on the building around this time.  \\n\nIn 1983, La Fortaleza , along with the San Juan National Historic Site , was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO .  \\n\nTrivia\nLa Fortaleza has two towers: the Astral Tower and the Homenaje Tower (Homage Tower), which show that it was originally a military structure.\\n\nThe Homage Tower houses the Santa Catalina Chapel , where a colorful mosaic of 95,000 pieces in honor of the Holy Trinity stands out.\\n\nIn 1956, when an area covered with a panel was unsealed, what could be the old kitch en of La Fortaleza was discovered in the Austral Tower .\\n\nThe paintings exhibited at La Fortaleza are on loan from the Institute of Puerto Rican Historical Culture and are changed according to the taste of the ruler of the day.\\n\nOriginally, La Fortaleza was painted salmon red, the characteristic color of the island\\'s military installations of the time of Spanish colony. Its wooden doors were green and its columns were painted white with gold details.\\n\nU.S. Presidents who have visited La Fortaleza , include Herbert Hoover in 1931, Harry S. Truman in 1948, John F. Kennedy in 1961, Barack Obama in 2011, and Bill Clinton in 2013.\\n\nLa Fortaleza has had 156 governors: 124 under the Spanish regime, 19 under the U.S. regime and 13 Puerto Ricans, 11 elected, one appointed by the President of the United States Jesús T. Piñero and one sworn in by the Constitution of Puerto Rico Wanda Vázquez Garced .\\n\nThree flags fly over La Fortaleza : the Puerto Rican flag, the American flag, and the Governor\\'s white flag. When the white flag is not raised, it is because the governor is outside the Santa Catalina Palace .\\n\nThe Hundido Garden was named Doña Inés Garden in honor of Doña Inés Mendoza , wife of former governor Luis Muñoz Marín , because that was her favorite spot at La Fortaleza , where she lived for 16 years.\\n\nIn literature\nIn 2011, Puerto Rican author Giannina Braschi wrote the dramatic novel United States of Banana , featuring climactic scenes of revolution at La Fortaleza.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

The highlight of the complex is the Paseo Tablado La Guancha , which is flanked by a beach, an observation tower, an amphitheater, and 24 open-air kiosks.  It was developed during the administration of Mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago .  In October 2017, after Hurricane Maria , it closed to the public to undergo repairs but, as of January 2020, when the area suffered severe damage due to the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes , no repairs had been made and, as of 17 June 2020, it remained closed.  By late 2020 arrangements were made for the merchants that operated from waterfront kiosks to reopen their businesses out of provisional facilities at a temporary location away from the waterfront while reconstruction of the waterfront area takes place.\\n\nHistory\nOriginally La Guancha consisted of a road and sidewalk alongside a dike built close to the easternmost shore of barrio Playa across from Ponce Yacht Club .  The romantic area was frequented by families and sweethearts alike, especially on weekends, for relaxation and bonding .  During the administration of Mayor Cordero , however, a number of facilities were added to the La Guancha area at a cost of over $18 million, developing it into a new recreational complex.  The new facilities followed the design of engineer Axel Bonilla Cortes.  \\n\nFacilities\nSeven new facilities were added to the existing walkway area:  \\n\nThis project complemented the recently inaugurated tourist pier in the nearby Port of Ponce , and which saw an investment of $4 million.  \\n\nFunding\nThe Complex was developed by the Department of Community and Economic Development of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce at a cost of $18.6 million.  The breakdown of the cost included $3.6 million in the acquisition of the Paseo Tablado La Guancha , 6.5 million in the purchase of over 27 acres (110,000 m 2 ) of land, $8.0 million in the construction of the project, $0.2 million for the bidding process, and $0.3 million for the upgrade of PR-12 (Avenida Santiago de los Caballeros) as infrastructure leading to the new complex.  \\n\nEffects of the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquake\nThe complex sustained damage due to the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquake .   \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nLajas, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nLajas  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Lajas Valley in southwestern Puerto Rico , on the southern coast of the island, bordering the Caribbean Sea , south of San Germán and Sabana Grande ; east of Cabo Rojo ; and west of Guánica . Lajas is spread over 11 barrios plus Lajas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Germán-Cabo Rojo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nLocated in the Lajas Valley , the town was founded in 1883 by the Xueta Teodoro Jácome Pagán . Xuetes ( Chuetas ) were Majorcan Jews ( Sephardic Catalan Jews). Some families changed their names from Jácome to the Castilian form Santiago . Jácome is the Mallorquin form of James (Ia\\'akov). Catalan Jews from Majorca were part of the early settlers in the south of Borikén (Puerto Rico).\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a colony of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Lajas was 8,789.  \\n\nThe village of La Parguera is a popular tourist destination to see the famous Bahía Fosforescente (Phosphorescent Bay) and its numerous keys and islets.  Parador La Parguera was founded by Puerto Rican comedian Henry LaFont (Julio Pancorbo Ortiz).  \\n\nPeople from the El Combate community in barrio Boquerón are known as mata con hacha (\"those who kill with axes\") based on folklore about a fight over the salinas , where those from Cabo Rojo fought with axes against people from the adjacent town of Lajas. Because the people from Lajas apparently fought back by throwing stones they are known as tira piedras (\"those who throw stones\").  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In Lajas, over 270 residences lost their roofs. The hurricane destroyed Lajas\\' pineapple industry.  \\n\nGeography\nLajas is located on the southern coast. Laguna Cartagena National Wildlife Refuge is a national protected area located in Lajas.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Lajas is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .       \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Lajas: El Papayo, El Tendal, Sector Sabana Yeguas, La Haya, Las Cuevas, Los Jovillos, Maguayo, Piñalejos, and Tokio.   \\n\n\\nLajas features a tropical savanna climate ( Aw/As ), common for southwestern Puerto Rico. The record high for the town is 103 °F (39 °C).\nDemographics\nTourism\nLajas is famous for its main touristic attraction, Bahía Fosforescente (La Parguera), a place where bioluminescent dinoflagellates of different colors appear when the water moves. The origin of the colored lights is the object of many legends. Lajas is also a fishing town.\\n\nThere are 5 beaches in Lajas.  \\nSome of the main attractions of Lajas are:\\n\nCulture\nLajas celebrates its patron saint festival in February. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as Tito Rojas , and Arcángel .  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Lajas include:\\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Lajas is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Jayson Martínez, from the New Progressive Party (PNP). Martínez was elected at the 2020 general election .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Ramón Ruiz and Martín Vargas Morales , from the Popular Democratic Party , were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nTransportation\nThere are 5 bridges in Lajas.  \\n\nNotable people\nSymbols\nLajas municipio or Municipality has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag consists of three horizontal stripes; the top one is green, the center one is white and the bottom one is light yellow. A vertical white stripe down the left makes a white cross. In the center of the cross is a ripe yellow pineapple. The cross is surrounded by eleven gold stars; five in the top  part and six in the lower part of the cross, in the form of a circle.  \\n\nIt is gold with a green band crossing it diagonally right to left; gold stands for the wealth of the land and green for the beauty of the valley, which is a gift from mother nature to Lajas. The band is adorned, at each end, with a pineapple bordered in gold and black. In the center of the band, also in gold, a marine shell. In the top left there is a red cardinal\\'s hat and in the bottom a red anchor with green; the shield has a 3 tower castle, each one with two windows and a door. On the bottom, outside the shield, a banner with the inscription \"Ciudad Cardenalicia\" (Cardinal City). This, for Cardinal Luis Aponte Martínez, born in Lajas, who was the first and only Cardinal of the Catholic Church from Puerto Rico. The banner and the inscription appear in black.  \\n\nGallery\nScenes around Lajas:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nLa Perla, San Juan, Puerto Rico\nLa Perla is a historical shanty town astride the northern historic city wall of Old San Juan , Puerto Rico , stretching about 650 yards (600 m) along the rocky Atlantic coast immediately east of the Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery and down the slope from (north of) Calle Norzagaray.\\n\nLa Perla was established in the 18th century. Initially, the area was the site of a slaughterhouse because the law required the homes of slaves and homeless black and coloured servants – as well as cemeteries – to be established away from the main community center: in this case, outside the city walls. Sometime after, some of the farmers and workers started living around the slaughterhouse and shortly established their houses there.\\n\nHistory, location and description\nLocated inside the Old San Juan Historic District , La Perla (The Pearl) was originally the site of a slaughterhouse, called El Matadero .  It was built in the 18th century outside the walls of San Juan by slaves who were required to live outside the city. Slaves built homes and lived near the slaughterhouse and later jíbaros , (Puerto Rican farmers) who moved to San Juan, lived there.  \\n\nLa Perla belongs to and consists of the northernmost stretches of Mercado subbarrio (west) and San Cristóbal subbarrio in San Juan Antiguo barrio . San Juan Antiguo barrio is located on Isleta de San Juan , an island off San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, and it is connected to the mainland by bridges and causeways. La Perla is in the Old San Juan Historic District which is managed by US National Park Service .  \\n\nLa Perla has sometimes been described as a slum and as a shantytown, because many homes have been built without proper permits . While tourists have normally been deterred from visiting La Perla, some entrepreneurs have tried to change its image with art galleries, cafés and restaurants. La Perla Impacto Comunitario , a local community group has coordinated tours.    \\n\nOnly four access points exist into La Perla: one through the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery , and the others from Calle Norzagaray, named after Spanish soldier and colonial governor, Fernándo Norzagaray y Escudero .  \\n\nDespite the fact that many homes in La Perla have been built without proper permits, residents of La Perla do have utility services. Garbage pickup is done regularly in the neighborhood, which in 1973 consisted of about 900 houses and 3,300 residents.  \\n\nLa Perla has a community-oriented music recording studio, El Estudio D\\' Oro, which serves as a free of cost music production workshop for all ages.  El Estudio D\\' Oro is also home to the FM urban radio show, Hip Hop 787 La Verdadera Escuela, which is broadcast live from the studio on WVOZ Mix 107.7 FM.\\n\nIn 2010, Carmelo Anthony remodeled the basketball court located to the eastern side of La Perla, with a new surface and design featuring the logo of Air Jordan 's Melo footwear line.  It eventually became known by the name of the Nuyorican athlete, who also repaired several other venues throughout the island.  The refurbished playing field was later included among \"the most breathtaking locations for a basketball court in the world\" due to its oceanside location overlooking the Atlantic.  \\n\nIn June 2011, the Drug Enforcement Agency with other agencies targeted 50 properties in La Perla and indicted 114 people from La Perla for drug trafficking .  The area has a reputation for being dangerous, but the popular 2017 Despacito music video filmed there made it a curiosity amongst tourists, with some wanting to venture in to see where the video was filmed.    \\n\nIn 2016, students of architecture at universities in Puerto Rico asked children for their ideas on how to improve their favorite areas of La Perla.    El Bowl is a colorful, bowl-shaped cemented area in La Perla, used for skateboarding on weekdays, and then filled with water on weekends, to serve as a pool.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and La Perla \"looked like it was hit by a bomb\".  \" Despacito \" (the song title that translates to \"slowly\") was also used to highlight and criticize the slow United States response to the destruction at La Perla caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria , where the video was filmed.  The National Park Service assisted the few residents of La Perla with tarps soon afterwards.  \\n\nCensus\nIn terms of the United States 2000 Census , La Perla is composed of Census blocks 3001 through 3010 ( Block group 3, Census tract 4, San Juan, Puerto Rico ). A population of 338 was reported, 198 housing units (29 unoccupied), and 169 households, on an area of 80,028 square yards (16.53 acres ; 66,914 m\\xc2\\xb2).\\n\nLa Perla belongs to and consists of the northernmost stretches of the subbarrios Mercado (west) and San Cristóbal in San Juan Antiguo barrio. The dividing line between the subbarrios is the imagined extension of Calle San Justo to the north beyond the old city wall to the Atlantic coast. The eastern part consists of Census blocks 3002, 3009 und 3010, with a population of 64, 35 housing units (4 unoccupied), and 31 households, on  41,348 square yards (8.5 acres ; 34,572 m\\xc2\\xb2).\\n\nMedia and popular culture\nLa Perla was the true site of the fictional \"La Esmeralda\" barrio depicted in Oscar Lewis \\'s sociological work \"La vida: a Puerto Rican family in the culture of poverty--San Juan and New York\", describing the lives of Puerto Rican slumdwellers and prostitutes. From La Perla, through taped interviews with dozens of intertwined family members who lived there in the 1940s-1960s, Lewis wrote an award-winning and controversial book. It was controversial because his award-winning book, written in 1967, would influence the way people viewed Puerto Rican women and Puerto Ricans, in general. \"Many who read his book assumed the whores of La Perla were typical of all Puerto Rican women.\"  \\n\nIn 1978, salsa singer Ismael Rivera had a hit song, written by composer Catalino Curet Alonso , in honor of this community, and named after it. In 2009 Urban Music group Calle 13 released another tribute song, also  named La Perla , in collaboration with Ruben Blades . In the song, Blades references Rivera\\'s early effort; in the song\\'s video, Blades pays his respects to Curet by visiting his tomb at the community\\'s Santa María Madgalena de Pazzis cemetery.\\n\nCanadian singer Nelly Furtado along with Calle 13 band member Residente filmed the music video to the remix of Furtado\\'s song No Hay Igual on 26 June 2006 in La Perla. Residente said he hoped that the video would help them both reach new audiences: \"It\\'s a good opportunity for us both. More than the North American market, the European market really interests me and her because her family is Portuguese.\"  The video was directed by Israel Lugo and Gabriel Coss , photographed by Sonnel Velazquez and produced by María Estades.  \\n\nIn Giannina Braschi \\'s political allegory United States of Banana (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo is born in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty as the illegitimate child of a woman from La Perla and the Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Muñoz Marín .   \\n\nThe Puerto Rican classic play, La Carreta , (1953) by René Marqués , takes place in La Perla. A poor family moves from their farm to La Perla, and then to the Bronx for the better life that they never quite find.  \\n\nThe motion picture The Vessel (film) , starring Martin Sheen , about a tidal wave that destroys a small town was filmed in La Perla in 2013.\\n\nWith more than 8.3 billion views on YouTube, La Perla became world-known with the music video for the song Despacito being filmed there.   \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n18°28\\xe2\\x80\\xb209\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°06\\xe2\\x80\\xb258\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.46917°N 66.11611°W ﻿ / 18.46917; -66.11611 \\n"

La Placita today is a popular dining and nightlife destination in San Juan , while still functioning as a produce and food market during the day.  \\n\nHistory\nThe market square was established in 1910 when the area was selected by Puerto Rico\\'s government to build a marketplace. The marketplace building had two levels, the first one for kiosks, food and produce stalls and other service businesses, while the second level had the butcher and the meat market. The building originally also had business spaces, including medical offices. The market square building has been renovated and modified on numerous occasions throughout the 20th century, and at some point the second level was demolished to increase the area of the main marketplace.  The marketplace lost its importance in the later second half of the 20th century which left the area in various stages of disrepair. The building and the neighborhood were revitalized in the 1990s and 2000s when numerous restaurant and entertainment businesses opened.

The park is flanked by two of Condado\\'s landmark hotels: to the west by the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel (1919), designed by Warren and Whitmore, and to the east  by the La Concha Hotel (1957), designed by Toro Ferrer . The 1.8 hectare public space was developed by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\\'s Tourism Company, and has been credited as one of the principal motors steering the district\\'s urban revitalisation.  \\n\nDesigned by Puerto Rican architect and urbanist Andrés Mignucci , La Ventana al Mar has won numerous awards for design excellence including awards in the American Institute of Architects Puerto Rico Chapter Design Awards, the Puerto Rico Architecture Biennale, the Miami + Beach Architecture Biennale (Bronze Medal) and the Iberoamerican Architecture Biennale.  In 2016, La Ventana al Mar was exhibited at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin as part of the Demo:polis-the Right to Public Space exhibit.  \\n\nThe project includes a large ornamental fountain designed in collaboration with Wet Design of Los Angeles and two public space sculptures by artist \\xc3\\x81ngel Botello . The park has been the site for music festivals like \"La Ventana al Jazz\" and weekend markets and fairs.\\n\nThe public space occupies the site of the old Condado Convention Center built in the 1970s and became one of the components of the controversial Condado Trio project. El Condado was built over decades with private hotels, apartments and high rise condominiums so that access to the beach and view of the ocean was only possible under difficult circumstances. In the late 1990s the three choice properties on Avenida Ashford - the Convention Center and the Vanderbilt and La Concha Hotels were closed and in state of disrepair. The Government of Puerto Rico proposed remodelling the Vanderbilt Hotel and demolishing the Condado Convention Center and La Concha. The Government awarded the project\\'s development to a US-based hotel consortium which proposed to build an all-inclusive hotel and condominium resort at this location.  The case became a political issue and was the subject of protests and challenges by the local community, the College of Architects and the Municipality of San Juan.  Finally a counter-project proposed by the Municipality of San Juan based on the revitalisation of the two landmark hotels and the creation of a central public space, La Ventana al Mar, was approved and completed in 2004.\\n\nReferences\n18°27\\xe2\\x80\\xb230\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°04\\xe2\\x80\\xb229\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.4583°N 66.0748°W ﻿ / 18.4583; -66.0748 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nSuckling pig\n\\n\nA suckling pig is a piglet fed on its mother\\'s milk , cochinillo asado (Spanish, literally \"roasted suckling pig\"), or leit\\xc3 3o ( Portuguese ; from leite \"milk\" + -\\xc3 3o) is a pork dish in several regions of the world, most specifically in Spain (in particular Segovia ), Portugal (in particular Bairrada ) and regions worldwide previously colonized by the Portuguese Empire or Spanish Empire . Lechón/Leit\\xc3 3o is a word referring to a roasted baby pig (piglet) which was still fed by suckling its mother\\'s milk (a suckling pig). Lechón/Leit\\xc3 3o is a popular item in the cuisine in Los Angeles (in the United States), Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico , Honduras, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru , Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and other Spanish-speaking nations in Latin America, as well as in Portugal , Cape Verde , Angola , Mozambique and other Portuguese-speaking nations.  It is also present as cochon de lait in the French-Swiss and French cuisines (in particular in Metz ), in Italy (in particular in Sardinian cuisine as su porcheddu ) and Romania .  The dish features a whole roasted suckling pig cooked over charcoal . It has been described as a national dish of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Spain, Portugal, as well as the Philippines . However, the pig-roasting traditions of the Philippines (similar to other Austronesian regions) have native pre-colonial origins. The meaning of \"lechon\" in Filipino has diverted from the original Spanish term  to become a general term for \"roasted pig\", and is used in reference to adult roasted pigs rather than to suckling pigs, with Cebu being asserted by American chef Anthony Bourdain as having the best pigs.   \\n\nIn most of these regions, lechón/leit\\xc3 3o is prepared throughout the year for special occasions, during festivals. It is the centerpiece of the tradition Cuban Christmas feast La Noche Buena .  After seasoning, the piglet is cooked by skewering the entire animal, entrails removed, on a large stick and cooking it in a pit filled with charcoal. The piglet is placed over the charcoal, and the stick or rod it is attached to is turned in a rotisserie action.\\n\nLechona , also known as lechón asado , is a popular Colombian dish .  It is similar in style to many preparations made in other South American countries, consisting of a roasted pig stuffed with yellow peas , green onion , and spices, cooked in an outdoor brick oven for several hours. Yellow rice is sometimes added, especially in Bogotá. It is mostly traditional to the Tolima Department in central Colombia and is usually accompanied by arepas , a corn-based dough.\\n\nThe dish has been described as a national dish of Puerto Rico.  [ a ] The name of the dish in Puerto Rico is lechón asado .  It is a traditional dish served at festivals and holidays.  \\n\nIn Indonesia , roast pig (using both adult or suckling pig) is called babi guling , babi putar , babi panggang or babi bakar ; it is predominantly found in non-Muslim majority regions, such as Hindu Bali and Christian Batak lands in North Sumatra , the Minahasa people of North Sulawesi , Toraja in South Sulawesi , Papua , and also among Chinese Indonesians . In Bali, babi guling is usually served with lawar and steamed rice ; it is a popular dish in Balinese restaurants and warungs .  In the Batak people\\'s tradition, babi guling is a prerequisite in wedding offerings by the bride\\'s family. In Papua, pigs and yams are roasted in heated stones placed in a hole dug in the ground and covered with leaves; this cooking method is called bakar batu (burning the stone), and it is an important cultural and social event among Papuan people.\\n\nThe Philippines , a former Spanish colony, also has a dish that acquired the Spanish name \"lechón\" (usually spelled lechon without diacritics , but also litson or lichon ); but it differs from the Spanish lechón in that it uses adult pigs, uses different native ingredients (distinctively lemongrass , binucao fruits, tamarind , and citrus leaves), is cooked differently, and is pre-colonial in origin (natively known as inasal or inihaw [na baboy] ).    It is most similar to neighboring native dishes like the Balinese babi guling (though differing in the stuffing and spices used).   \\n\nVariants of lechón that use suckling pigs are differentiated as lechon de leche (which in Spanish would be a linguistic redundancy), but otherwise are cooked in the native way as in regular lechon.  The dish that is explicitly derived from the Spanish lechón style of cooking is known as cochinillo . Unlike native Filipino lechons which are stuffed and cooked slowly over charcoals on a bamboo spit, cochinillo uses a suckling pig that is splayed and roasted in an oven.  \\n\nThe term lechon has also become generalized as a loanword for anything spit-roasted over coals. It is also used for other Filipino dishes like lechon manok (native roasted chicken) and lechon baka (a whole cow spit-roasted Filipino-style), thus lechon made from whole pig is differentiated as \"lechon baboy\" (literally \"pig lechon\").    \\n\nIn various Chinese communities (especially in Southern China), a roast suckling pig is purchased for special family occasions, business launches, or as a ritualistic spiritual offering. For example, one tradition is to offer one or several whole roast suckling pigs to the Jade Emperor to celebrate a Chinese film\\'s opening. The pig is sacrificed to ward off evils and in prayer for the film\\'s success. One garnish used to make the dish look more appealing is a circular slice of pineapple and cherry, and is often placed in a red box for luck.\\n\nSuckling pig dishes in parts of Southeast Asia, like Singapore and Vietnam , are also influenced by ethnic Chinese cuisine. Roast suckling pig is eaten in Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants for important parties.  It is also a popular dish at wedding dinners or a party for a baby\\'s completion of its first month of life.   \\n\nThe European cuisines of Austria, Croatia, England, Georgia, Germany, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Sweden   favor the dish highly as well. It accompanies goose as the traditional Christmas feast of families in Russia and Serbia, while the Russian Navy maintains a tradition of presenting a roast piglet (or several) to the crew of a ship returning from deployment.\\n\nSuckling pig is known in German, Austrian and German-Swiss cuisines as Spanferkel and in the Dutch cuisine as speenvarken . It can be roasted in the oven  or grilled, and is often served at festive occasions such as Oktoberfest .  \\n\nIn Sweden suckling pig is called sp\\xc3 4dgris , it is usually cooked in the oven, or sometimes roasted directly over the fire. It is often stuffed with various fruits such as apples and plums, together with butter and breadcrumbs.  \\n\nThe suckling pig is used in Cajun cuisine in the southern U.S., where the Cochon de Lait Festival  is held annually in the small town of Mansura, Louisiana . During this festival, as its name implies, suckling pigs are roasted. Other uses for the suckling pig in the U.S. include slow roasting in an oven or (as in a Hawaiian-style pig roast ) in a pit. The latter remains popular in the cuisine of the Southern United States . [ citation needed ] \\n\nSee also\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nLegend of Diego Salcedo\nDiego Salcedo (died 1511) was a semi-legendary Spanish conquistador who is said to have lived during the colonization of the Americas .  According to legend, his death at the hands of the indigenous Taíno people ignited the Taíno rebellion of 1511 .\\n\nSalcedo\\'s death\nAccording to the story, Salcedo died in 1511, during a trip to Puerto Rico, when Taínos , under the command of Agüeybaná II (brother of the great Taino Cacique Agüeybaná ) and the Cacique of Añasco , Urayoán , drowned him in the Río Grande de Añasco .  Historically, two versions about how Salcedo was lured to his death have collided. Many books assert that the soldier had been told he\\'d be taken to a lake filled with Taíno women that he could have sex with, and, once there, he found not women, but men who then proceeded to drown him. The other version has Salcedo being offered a ride across a river by Taínos who carried him on their arms, and then drowned him and kept him for days, afraid he\\'d still be alive and waiting until they were certain he was dead.  \\n\nA third, and most accepted version of Salcedo\\'s death says that the Tainos, fearing that the Spaniards might be gods, refrained from harming them. After suffering under the Spaniards for so long, the Tainos, by order of Agüeybaná, ambushed Salcedo as he was drinking water at the edge of a river. Fearing that Salcedo might resurrect after three days—based on their understanding of the Christian teachings wielded by Catholic priests—they sat around for three days waiting for Salcedo to come back from the dead, but all they saw was Salcedo\\'s body rotting due to the heat just as they would. At that moment the Tainos realized that these were no gods.  \\n\nIt was with Salcedo\\'s death that the Taínos were encouraged to declare war on the Spaniards in Puerto Rico. This led to the Taino rebellion of 1511. However, the Tainos were quickly defeated due to the Spaniards\\' better weaponry and war expertise. After the death of Agüeybaná II, the native warriors retracted and became disorganized.  Agüeybaná II\\'s followers opted for engaging the Spaniards via guerilla tactics.  Such guerilla warfare lasted for the next eight years, until 1519.  A second round of raids erupted in 1513 when Ponce de Leon departed the island to explore Florida. The settlement of Caparra , the seat of the island government at that time, was sacked and burned by an alliance between Taínos and natives from the northeastern Antilles.  \\n\nBy 1520 the Taíno presence on the island had almost disappeared. A government census in 1530 reports the existence of only 1,148 Taínos remaining in Puerto Rico.  However, oppressive conditions for the surviving Taíno continued. Many of those who stayed on the island soon died either due to cruel treatment or the smallpox epidemic, which attacked the island in 1519.   \\n\nLegend\nA local legend tells of a ghostly Taino woman, supposedly Salcedo\\'s lover, that still haunts the site of his drowning at Añasco. This belief is exemplified by a verse in the town\\'s anthem:  \\n\nHistory tells that here Salcedo was drowned, and that in the fall a female Taino is seen at night.\nSalcedo in popular culture\nSalcedo is referenced in a song of Puerto Rican rock band Fiel a la Vega . The song is titled \"El Asunto: Salcedo Sigue Siendo Mortal\" (The Issue: Salcedo is still a Mortal) and it makes a comparison between the Spaniards \\' rule in the island and the United States \\' invasion of 1898.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nLetras de Ponce\n\\n\nThe Letras de Ponce (English: Ponce letters) is a famous landmark in Barrio Sabanetas in Ponce, Puerto Rico , located southbound on PR-52 at the intersection with PR-10 . The iconic monument consists of five letters that spell the name of the city P-O-N-C-E in 20-foot  high (6.1 m) by 18-foot  wide (5.5 m) by 12-foot  deep (3.7 m) red and black letters. The letters, and its resulting sign, were designed by Carlos Rivera Villafañe, a sculptor from Ponce.  The landmark is said to be \"known to every Puerto Rican.\"  \\n\nHistory\nIn 2002 the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation presented a contest for the design of a monument to be placed on State Route 52 (PR-52), at the entrance of the city of Ponce.  The contest was part of what would become 97 projects of public art spread throughout Puerto Rico.  \\n\nIn selecting the work of art, the Government of Puerto Rico considered 318  submissions from hundreds of artists around the world, including Ada Bobonis , Ann Hamilton , Antoni Muntadas , Liliana Porter , and Devorah Sperber .  Rivera Villafañe\\'s proposal was one of the winners, and the winner for the Ponce entrance monument.\\n\nConstruction and design\nThe letters are built of \"marine steel\", also known as corteen , the same material used in the construction of ships.  Each letter measures 20 feet high by 18 feet wide by 12 feet deep.  Together they span an area of half a kilometer. The breadth of the letters is intended to symbolize the extension of the city of Ponce, \"heightening Ponce\\'s urban identity and raising it to its territorial extension.\"  The letters cost US$430,000.  Its design, manufacture and suiting all were done in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nCarlos A. Rivera Villafañe\nCarlos A. Rivera Villafañe was born in Ponce in 1966. He graduated from the Escuela de Artes Graficas de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico with a bachelor\\'s degree in 1989. In addition to the Letras de Ponce , Rivera Villafañe has works in San Juan , Madrid, Lima , Havana , Cuenca , Slovenia , Yugoslavia , New York City, and Miami.   \\n\nMaintenance\nThe monument is regularly maintained with fresh paint as recommended by its designer.  They require special care as well as a special paint.  They are painted in black and red, the traditional colors of the city of Ponce.  The monument is also painted after acts of vandalism, including graffiti.\\n\nLocation\nThe monument is located on smooth, flat terrain, and each letter is surrounded by flowers. Its site is just outside the northeastern edge of the urban area of Ponce, on PR-52, the main road into Ponce from San Juan. While the monument is visible as motorists approach the city on the highway, it has been noted that motorists are not able to stop to admire it, as they risk being fined.  \\n\nThe monument\\'s unique location made it an ideal site to hold a protest. In October 2009, a group of some 20 Government of Puerto Rico public employees used the site to launch a protest against their recent layoff.  \\n\nAlterations and vandalism\nIt is illegal to make unauthorized physical alterations to the sign. The letters have been vandalised a few times. In November 2011, the letter \"O\" was vandalised with graffiti.  \\n\nControversy\nDue to its location at the center and both sides of a major expressway, it is one of Puerto Rico\\'s most controversial works of public art.  In April 2009, the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTOP) was fined almost US$80 million for placing the letters there.  Subsequently, a bill was introduced into the Legislature of Puerto Rico to eliminate public art from Puerto Rico roads. The basis was that, allegedly, they were in violation of the Federal Highway Administration regulations.  In February 2010, it was agreed that the letters would stay where they were.  \\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°1\\xe2\\x80\\xb231.51\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°34\\xe2\\x80\\xb212.86\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.0254194°N 66.5702389°W ﻿ / 18.0254194; -66.5702389 \\n\n\\n"

In April 2016, Miranda and Jeremy McCarter published Hamilton: The Revolution , a book describing Hamilton ' s journey from conception to Broadway success. It also discusses the sense of cultural revolution that permeates the show.  \\n\nMiranda gave his last performance in Hamilton on July 9, 2016,  but vowed to return to the show.  In 2017, he announced that he would reprise the role for one night in celebration of President Obama\\'s commutation of the sentence of Oscar López Rivera .  \\n\nA documentary about the creation of the show, Hamilton\\'s America , featuring Miranda, premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 1, 2016, and first aired on PBS \\' Great Performances series on October 21, 2016.   A taping of the OBT version of Hamilton was released on Disney+ on July 3, 2020.\\n\nOn January 24, 2016, Miranda performed the offstage cameo role of Loud Hailer in the Broadway production of Les Misérables ,  fulfilling his childhood dream of being in the show, as it was the first production he ever saw on Broadway.  \\n\nIn January 2019, Miranda reprised the title role in Hamilton for a three-week limited engagement at the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center in Puerto Rico from January 11-27, 2019, for which the engagement was sold out in three hours in November 2018.   In a review, Chris Jones praised \"deeper on-stage emotions\" in Miranda\\'s reprisal, as well as improved vocal and dance technique than on Broadway.  In March that same year he played King Arthur in a benefit concert of Camelot at Lincoln Center opposite Solea Pfeiffer and Jordan Donica .  \\n\nIn 2023, he wrote additional lyrics for the Broadway musical New York, New York .  \\n\nIn August 2023, it was reported that he had begun work on a stage musical adaptation of the novel The Warriors (which was formerly adapted into the 1979 film of the same name ).  Miranda worked with Eisa Davis on a concept album based on the novel, Warriors , which will be released on October 18, 2024.  \\n\nMiranda made his feature film debut in the Walt Disney Pictures live-action film The Odd Life of Timothy Green (2012).   \\n\nMiranda interviewed with Disney in the winter of 2013. He submitted a six-song demo package to Walt Disney Animation Studios .  This began a series of collaborations with the company:\\n\nOn November 7, 2008, Universal Pictures announced that they planned to adapt In the Heights as a feature film for release in 2011.  However, the project was canceled in March 2011,  reportedly due to the fact Universal was looking for a \"bankable Latino star\" like Shakira or Jennifer Lopez instead of unknown actors.  In January 2012, Miranda stated that the film adaptation was back under discussion;  in May 2016, it was announced that Miranda would co-produce the film with Harvey Weinstein and backing from The Weinstein Company .  On June 10, 2016, Jon M. Chu came on board to direct the film adaptation of the musical .  In the aftermath of numerous sexual misconduct allegations made against Weinstein, his producer credit on the film was removed, with the rights to the film eventually auctioned off to Warner Bros. for $50 million.  While Miranda originated the role of Usnavi, he felt he was too old to star as Usnavi in the film adaptation. Ultimately, Miranda played the smaller role of Piraguero, the \"Piragua Guy\", in the film. He was quoted as saying the Broadway production was \"...a miraculous experience. I went from substitute teacher to Broadway composer. I will never make a leap that big again in my life. I was very content to let Anthony Ramos and this incredible cast have their own experience.\"  Miranda also served as producer and acted alongside Anthony Ramos,  Corey Hawkins ,  Leslie Grace ,  and Jimmy Smits .  The film was set for release on June 26, 2020,  but was pulled from the schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic \\'s impact on the film industry .  It was released in theaters and temporarily on HBO Max on June 10, 2021.  \\n\nMiranda stars as the titular character in addition to providing eleven songs and serving as an executive producer for Vivo , a Sony Pictures Animation film directed by Kirk DeMicco which was released on Netflix in August 2021.    \\n\nImagine Entertainment announced in July 2018 that Miranda would make his debut as a film director with an adaptation of Jonathan Larson \\'s semi-autobiographical musical Tick, Tick... Boom! , to be scripted by Dear Evan Hansen librettist Steven Levenson .   Miranda produced the film alongside Ron Howard and Brian Grazer :  it was released on Netflix in 2021.   \\n\nMiranda agreed in 2016 to serve as executive producer and composer of Lionsgate \\'s film adaptation of The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss , as well as a tie-in television series.   In 2022, it was revealed that he was no longer attached to the project.\\n\nMiranda also worked in television. In 2007, he made a small appearance on the television series The Sopranos in the episode \" Remember When \",  and in 2009, he played Juan \"Alvie\" Alvarez, Gregory House \\'s roommate in a psychiatric hospital, in the two-hour season six premiere episode of House ; he returned to the role in May 2010. For Sesame Street , he occasionally played roles and sang the theme song to the recurring segment Murray Has a Little Lamb .  He was a composer and actor on the 2009 revival of The Electric Company   and appeared in the CollegeHumor sketch \"Hardly Working: Rap Battle\", playing himself working as an intern and rapper.  \\n\nHe played several television roles during this period. He appeared on the TV series Modern Family in the 2011 episode \" Good Cop Bad Dog \".  In 2013, he played the recurring role of Ruben Marcado in the NBC drama Do No Harm .  He later appeared in the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother , in an all-verse episode titled \"Bedtime Stories\" that aired in November 2013.  \\n\nOn April 24, 2016, on the TV show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , at the end of a segment about the debt crisis in Puerto Rico, Miranda performed an emotional rap about allowing the island to restructure its debt.  Miranda hosted Saturday Night Live on October 8, 2016, and played himself in two episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm in 2017, receiving Emmy Award nominations for both appearances.  In 2019, Miranda was the guest narrator at Disney\\'s Candlelight Processional at Disneyland .  \\n\nMiranda performed the theme song for the Netflix original series The Magic School Bus Rides Again , the revival and sequel series of the 1994 series The Magic School Bus . He played the part of Amy\\'s brother (David Santiago) in the episode \" The Golden Child \" in Brooklyn Nine-Nine . On July 29, 2019, it was announced that Miranda had teamed with TV producer Norman Lear to make an American Masters documentary about the life of Puerto Rican actress Rita Moreno , titled Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It .  It premiered at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival . Miranda, in collaboration with Brittany Howard , Daveed Diggs , Kristen Anderson-Lopez , and Robert Lopez , wrote the lyrics for the song \"Checks and Balances\", which was sung by Benjy Brooke for the 2021 Netflix animated series We the People .  \\n\nIn 2019, Miranda served as an executive producer on the FX limited series Fosse/Verdon based on the relationship of Broadway dancer, choreographer, and director Bob Fosse and his wife dancer Gwen Verdon . Miranda also made a brief appearance playing Roy Scheider from All That Jazz . The series won critical acclaim, and Miranda was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series as an executive producer.\\n\nMiranda was cast as Lee Scoresby in the BBC series television adaptation of His Dark Materials (2019).  Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter praised Miranda in his review writing, \"[While] I appreciate that Miranda feels initially miscast as Pullman\\'s paragon of cowboy American masculinity...[he] forces you to reconstruct an image of American manliness around him, making him exactly what the series needs\".  \\n\nHe appears as Hermes , messenger of the gods, in Percy Jackson and the Olympians , which premiered on Disney+ on December 19, 2023.  \\n\nPersonal life\nMiranda and his wife, Vanessa Nadal, attended high school together and married in 2010. Nadal is a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Fordham University School of Law . She was a lawyer at the law firm Jones Day from 2010 to 2016.  At the wedding reception, Miranda, along with the wedding party, performed the Fiddler on the Roof song \" To Life \".   \\n\nMiranda and Nadal have two sons: Sebastian (b. 2014) and Francisco (b. 2018).   His son Sebastian was named after the Jamaican crab from The Little Mermaid , one of his favorite films, the reason for which he took the job of composing the music for live-action version.  Sebastian was the first name listed in the production babies credits of Moana , for which Miranda wrote the songs.  \\nMiranda\\'s son Francisco is listed as a production baby in the credits for Vivo .\\n\nMiranda discovered that he is related to artists Residente and iLe of Calle 13 during a 2009 concert by the group in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where Miranda was invited to perform. Backstage, the mother of Residente and ILE revealed their connection to Gilberto Concepción de Gracia , founder of the Puerto Rican Independence Party .    Miranda and Residente have since confirmed the relationship.     In 2017, Miranda performed on the opening track of Residente\\'s self-titled debut album .  \\n\nMiranda is a cousin of professional baseball player José Miranda .  \\n\nAfter a meeting with President Barack Obama in March 2016,  Miranda joined U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand , Chuck Schumer , Elizabeth Warren , and other Democratic lawmakers to call for congressional action to back a Senate bill in Washington that would allow Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy and significantly ease its $70 billion government-debt burden .  Miranda was particularly active in the wake of Hurricane Maria \\'s devastation in Puerto Rico,   and by December 2017, proceeds from his song \" Almost Like Praying \" helped the Hispanic Federation raise $22 million for rescue efforts and disaster relief.   \\n\nMiranda uses proceeds from Hamilton to support Graham Windham , a nonprofit adoption agency founded by Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton .  Miranda performs at their fundraising gala benefits in New York City and helps to fundraise for children in foster care.  \\n\nHe performed \" Found/Tonight \" with Ben Platt at the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence rally in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 2018.   \\n\nIn order to raise money for Puerto Rico\\'s reconstruction after being struck by hurricanes Irma and María , including at least $15 million to be channeled through the Flamboyán Foundation, Lin-Manuel decided to take, and once again play the protagonist role in Hamilton to his father\\'s native Puerto Rico. The Miranda family donated approximately $1 million to bring the University of Puerto Rico theater up to par in order to use it as the venue for the musical\\'s performance in January 2018. After tickets sold out in two hours for the three-week run, producers decided to move out of the university venue due to warnings of potential disruptions by a university workers\\' labor organization, and move the already-installed set to the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center in Santurce , where the performances ran from January 11 to January 27. The production donated additional hundreds of thousands of dollars in improvements to the Ferré Performing Arts Center.  \\n\nIn 2016, Miranda advocated for the passing of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), a law setting out to restructure the debt of Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.  The law led to budget cuts resulting in the closure of over 200 public schools, cuts to government labor benefits, and budget cuts at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR). It was met with protests, with UPR shutting down due to student strikes over the measures in 2017. Miranda became a target of criticism, especially when he performed Hamilton in Puerto Rico, given his lobbying on the bill as well as the musical\\'s subject matter of the United States which many Puerto Ricans see as an oppressor of the island.  During the post show, Miranda met with protestors explaining that he had seen PROMESA as the only bipartisan option for the debt crisis previously, he does not support the austerity measures introduced and that he believes full debt-relief should now be pursued.  Subsequently, he has argued for full debt-relief for the island  and noted that the 2016 act has not led to the promised relief.  \\n\nAwards and honors\nAmong his numerous accolades, Miranda has won a Pulitzer Prize , five Grammys , three Tony Awards , two Primetime Emmy Awards , and two Olivier Awards and has been nominated for two Academy Awards . In 2015, he was the recipient of a Genius Grant from the MacArthur Fellows Program . In 2016, Time magazine included Miranda in its annual Time 100 as one of the \"Most Influential People in the World\" and he received a star on the Puerto Rico Walk of Fame.   Miranda received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on November 30, 2018.  In December 2018, he received the Kennedy Center Honors for creating Hamilton .  \\n\nIn 2015, Miranda was the recipient of Smithsonian Magazine\\'s American Ingenuity Award in the History category.  In 2019, Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery awarded Miranda the Portrait of a Nation prize.  The Hamilton Mixtape , a cover album by Miranda, further reached number one on the Billboard 200 .\\n\nHonorary degrees \\n\nMiranda received an honorary degree in 2009 from Yeshiva University in Washington Heights, Manhattan , becoming the youngest person to receive an honorary degree from that university.  Ed Koch , former mayor of New York City , presented Miranda with the degree.  \\n\nHe received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 2015 from his alma mater, Wesleyan University ,  and gave their commencement address.  In May 2016, he received an honorary Doctorate of the Arts from the University of Pennsylvania and gave the commencement speech.  In July 2016, The University of Puerto Rico granted him a doctorate, honoris causa .  In July 2022, he received an honorary doctorate from the Royal Academy of Music in London, England .  \\n\nWork\nBibliography\nDiscography\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

It was built to guide passing ships through the southeast entrance from the Caribbean Sea through the treacherous Mona Passage into the Atlantic Ocean . The lighthouse is located over a white lime cliff which is surrounded by salt water lagoons and marshes . The cliffs surrounding the lighthouse drop over 200 feet into the ocean.\\n\nThe lighthouse\\'s architecture is distinguished by its simplicity, with minimal decoration and an unelaborated cornice repeated through the structure. The illuminating apparatus is housed in a cast-iron , copper and glass lantern . The lenticular lens was manufactured by the French firm Sautter, Lemonnier and Company.\\n\nOriginally, the lighthouse was staffed by two keepers and an engineer, who lived on the grounds with their families. In 1967 the lighthouse was renovated and its operation is currently completely automated. The structure itself has been abandoned for decades, although recent the local government as well as local civic groups, such as Caborrojeños Pro Salud y Ambiente , are pushing towards turning the old lighthouse keeper\\'s house into a museum. The project was taken over by the municipality, an action that lost U.S. Federal government funds that had been assigned for it. The municipality took over the renovations, which, according to critics, has irrevocably damaged the historical significance of the internal structure.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nLos Tres Picachos State Forest\nLos Tres Picachos State Forest  is one of the 20 forests that make up the public forest system of Puerto Rico . The forest is located in the Central Mountain Range or Cordillera Central , along the Los Tres Picachos mountain ridge, one of the island\\'s highest mountains, named after the distinctive three peaks of the highest mountain in the forest. The state forest is located in the municipalities of Jayuya and Ciales .  \\n\nHistory\nLos Tres Picachos State Forest was proclaimed and designated in February 16, 1999 through executive order OE-199-10. This proclamation was made thanks to effort and interest from local residents, the municipal administrations of Ciales and Jayuya, and the Guardianes de la Montaña ecological group. Its purpose is to preserve the ecological integrity of the forest terrains from urban development.  \\n\nGeography\nThe forest is found along two river basins: the Arecibo and Manatí Rivers , both flowing northward into the Atlantic Ocean . Other rivers found within the forest boundaries are the Cialitos , Saliente and Toro Negro rivers. The forest is particularly vital for the hydrological preservation of the Toro Negro River. The most notable geographical feature of the forest reserve is the Tres Picachos mountain which rises to an elevation of 3,176 feet (968 m) above sea level. Tres Picachos literally translates to three little peaks , and it is named as such after the three distinctive peaks found in the summit of the mountain.\\n\nThe state forest is found in a transition zone between a karstic area and another of volcanic origin.  \\n\nEcology\nThe forest is divided into three forest zones: the subtropical broadleaf forest , the montane or cloud forest and the tropical humid or rain forest . The ecological biomes found in the forest are the dwarf forest (above 1,090 meters over sea level), the Sierra palm tree forest (between 850 and 1,090 meters above sea level), the tabonuco tree forest (between 700 and 850 meters), and the secondary forest found in former coffee plantation areas which have now been reclaimed by nature.  \\n\nSome of the plant species found in the forest are the western cherry laurel or almendron ( Prunus occidentalis ), the tabloncillo tree ( Sideroxylon portoricense ), the moca tree ( Andira inermis ), the granadillo tree ( Buchenavia capitata ), the Puerto Rican magnolia ( Magnolia portoricensis ), the nutget or nemoca tree ( Ocotea moschata ), the candlewood or tabonuco tree ( Dacryodes excelsa ), the Sierra palm tree ( Prestoea montana ), and the invasive African tulip tree ( Spathodea campanulata ) which is found mostly in the secondary or second-growth forest area. The forest is also home to epiphytic plants such as bromeliads and orchids .  \\n\nThe forest is rich in animal species and it is home to a large number of endemic species. The following are some of the species found in the forest and its rivers.  \\n\nRecreation\nThe forest currently does not have infrastructure for the purpose of recreation and there is no parking or sanitary services either. There is however a single trail that leads to two of the three peaks of Los Tres Picachos mountain summit.    Coabey in Jayuya is the closest town to the forest and it can be accessed by PR-10 and PR-123 roads from Ponce .  \\n\nA famous sight within the forest is the Las Delicias Falls ( Cascada Las Delicias ),  a series of waterfalls found along the Cialitos River . The main waterfall can be accessed through PR-149 by a short scramble through rocks, however parking in the area is highly limited with there being only four spots to park.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\n18°12\\xe2\\x80\\xb254\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°32\\xe2\\x80\\xb210\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.215°N 66.536°W ﻿ / 18.215; -66.536 \\n"

In addition, it counted with a community closet, permitting people to donate as well as take pieces of clothing. Jackson had clarified that making a profit is not the goal, as she viewed Loverbar as a space to provide employment to queer individuals and allegedly paid them above minimum wage ,     at $9.00 an hour.  \\n\nIntervention by the Puerto Rico Police had been frequent, since they had dispersed crowds that tended to gather outside the club, or entered armed to the venue. A notable police raid was carried out on the night of 22 July 2021, when, half an hour before closing, ten armed police officers blocked the bar entrance, while another ten raided it. This was allegedly due to a complaint filed by a neighbor, alleging a lack of COVID-19 regulation enforcement as well as use of public space for private purposes . While there was no substance to the complaint, permit enforcers did fine Jackson for lacking a permit to operate a bar with a closed kitchen. (The kitchen had closed only about an hour prior.) This was decried on social media,      including Pedro Julio Serrano   and Manuel Natal Albelo ,  citing harassment and discrimination, as the San Juan mayor , Miguel Romero Lugo , said that other establishments had been inspected as well, however, he and his office refused to detail which were those.     subsequently, Romero Lugo made a press release confirming his stance against discrimination.  Nonetheless, the only other venue to be reviewed in a similar manner was Club 77.   Other neighboring establishments, such as Paseo Bar, Iluminati and El Ensayo, were also visited that night by the Police operatives. The raids had been an alleged part of an attempt to gentrify the area.  \\n\nWithout prior warning, Loverbar announced its closure on its social media profiles on 8 December 2021, with that night being its last and directing its patrons to donate directly to the venue\\'s employees.   \\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n 18°23\\xe2\\x80\\xb258\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°03\\xe2\\x80\\xb208\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.399355555914°N 66.052160715376°W ﻿ / 18.399355555914; -66.052160715376 \\n"

Ferré in Spanish) is a multi-use performance centre located in the barrio of Santurce in San Juan , Puerto Rico . It features three main concert and theater halls for plays, ballet , operas and concerts. It was renamed in 1994 after the late Puerto Rican philanthropist, politician and Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis A. Ferré .\\n\nThe Center opened on April 9, 1981 under the administration of Governor Carlos Romero Barceló after ten years of planning, project financing, and construction. Since then, it has become the most important performing arts venue in the Puerto Rican capital, presenting the highest level of commercial theater in Puerto Rico along with ballets and operas, and also hosting artists such as Plácido Domingo and Menudo . The center is home to the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra and the annual Casals Festival .\\n\nIn January 2019, Lin-Manuel Miranda 's musical Hamilton began its third touring production at the venue, with Miranda reprising the title role of Founding Father and Secretary of Treasury , Alexander Hamilton , with higher praise than his original run on Broadway.  Miranda returned to the venue after nine years since he reprised the role of Usnavi exclusively in San Juan during the North American touring production of In the Heights , which he also wrote.\\n\nFacilities\nThe Center features four main concert and theater halls, two eateries and a central outdoor plaza, each with its own unique features:\\n\nSurrounding art\nThe center is surrounded by various art expositions, including murals, paintings, and sculptures. The two largest halls feature art expositions which distinguishes each one:\\n\nNear the entrance of the center, various expositions greet guests and visitors, including a 40-foot (12 m) aluminum sculpture by Luis Torruella titled Melodic Reflection . However, the main art theme of the center\\'s entrance are The Muses . These are two separate works of art, one being an assortment of 6-foot-tall (1.8 m) bronze female sculptures along the Juan Morel Campos Plaza,  by Annex Burgos; and the second being a large mural at the center\\'s fa\\xc3 7ade (pictured above), made from a mixture concrete and crystal stones and designed by Augusto Marín .

        "page_content": "Contents\nLuis Muñoz Marín International Airport\n\\n\nLuis Muñoz Marín International Airport ( IATA : SJU , ICAO : TJSJ , FAA LID : SJU ) is a joint civil-military international airport located in suburban Carolina, Puerto Rico , three miles (5 km) southeast of San Juan . It is named for Luis Muñoz Marín , Puerto Rico\\'s first democratically elected governor, and was known as Isla Verde International Airport ( Aeropuerto Internacional de Isla Verde ) until it was renamed in February 1985. It is the busiest airport in the Caribbean region by passenger traffic. Over 4 million passengers boarded a plane at the airport per year according to the Federal Aviation Administration , making it the 48th busiest airport overseen by said federal agency.  \\n\nThe airport is owned by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and managed by Aerostar Airport Holdings , a public-private partnership which was awarded a lease by the government of Puerto Rico to operate and manage the airport for 40 years beginning in 2013.  SJU is the second international airport to be privatized in the United States or its territories, and, as of 2013, is the only currently privatized airport in the nation.  Taxis and rental cars can transport travelers to and from the airport. The airport serves as a gateway to the Caribbean islands. SJU covers 1,600 acres (647 ha) of land.   \\n\nHistory\nIn 1945, aware of the importance of aviation for the development of the economy of Puerto Rico, the island government had pointed out the need to build a newer international airport capable of handling the growing air traffic of San Juan International Airport , in Isla Grande, that had been operating since 1929; as well as responding to the needs of the future. Until then Isla Grande had been the main airport of Puerto Rico. As airlines began switching from propeller aircraft to jets, the 4,000 foot (1,200 m) Isla Grande airstrip did not have the necessary distance for modern aircraft to land and take off. (The Isla Grande Airport, now named in honor of Maj. Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci, pilot of the US Air Force F-111 , who was killed in action in Libya in 1986, currently has a runway of 5,542 feet (1,689 m) in length.)\\n\nOn the other hand, the government had also decided that it should direct the air operations, relying these powers in the Puerto Rico Transportation Authority, created in 1942, which later became the Ports Authority . The Committee of Airports of the Planning Board began to study the feasibility of the new airport, submitting in 1944 its plans and studies to the Federal Civil Aeronautics Administration , to determine the most appropriate place.\\n\nIn 1945, it was determined that the place would be Isla Verde (Carolina), to make the airport a metropolitan facility. Construction was approved by the Puerto Rico Planning Board in 1946, and the project began in 1947. During that same year, the Port Authority of Puerto Rico assumed title to and ownership of the Isla Grande Airport and other regional airports, which had been military installations during World War II.\\n\nThe design of the new airport was carried out by the firm of Toro-Ferrer , founded by the architects Miguel Ferrer (1914-2004), and architect Osvaldo Toro (1914-1995), which were also known for their designs of the Caribe Hilton Hotel and the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.\\n\nDuring 1949, the first phase of construction of the Isla Verde Airport was completed: cleaning, filling, leveling and drainage of soils. The second phase also began: paving the runway, taxiways, and platforms.\\n\nThe certified airlines operating in Puerto Rico in 1950 were Pan American World Airways , Eastern Air Lines , Caribbean Atlantic Airlines , British Airways , Iberia , Dominicana Airlines and Flying Tigers Airline . The latter contracted the movement of migrant workers to the United States, with the Insular Department of Labor, transferring some 5,706 workers to different points of that nation, at a cost of $55 per passage.\\n\nOn May 22, 1955, the Puerto Rico International Airport was inaugurated, built on a 1,718.72 acres (695.54 ha) land lot. The facilities, estimated at a cost of $22 million, had a six-story passenger terminal, control tower, 7,800 foot (2,400 m) long runway (8-26), cargo building, fire and police stations, and a hotel.\\n\nHundreds of people, enthusiastic about the new aerial installation, witnessed the inaugural events presided over by Luis Muñoz Marín . In a part of his eloquent speech, the Governor said: \"Impressive is this work in its structure and in its many facilities, but not as impressive as the fact that this center of communications symbolizes the great technical processes that are transforming civilization\".\\n\nThe first year of operations of the new airport produced an upward movement of passengers to 694,199 and a total of 28 million pounds of cargo was handled.\\n\nBy 1959, major airlines had introduced jets, which significantly reduced flight time and increased flight cruising safety. At the start of operations, the airport had only one runway (8/26), the old control tower on top of the hotel, 3 terminals and a parking lot for 200 cars.\\n\nDuring the beginning of the 60s, several expansion and improvement projects began, starting with the runway extending from 7,800-10,000 feet (2,400-3,000 m) in length. Construction of the second runway (10-28) on the south side began in May 1967. The project was completed in 1974 at an approximate cost of $4.2 million. With the introduction of the 747 aircraft, runway 8-26 was reinforced and widened in 1974, and ten years later it was repaved.\\n\nOn January 17, 1983, the two-leveled vehicular access system was built at a cost of approximately $9.2 million. This access separates the arrivals and departures of passengers at different levels, to eliminate traffic congestion.\\n\nOn February 18, 1985, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Rafael Hernández Colón , converted to law the project to Senate Number 1, officially designating the international airport under the name of Luis Muñoz Marín, in honor of the first governor of Puerto Rico elected by the people.\\n\nThe airport served as a hub for Pan Am, Trans Caribbean Airways , Eastern Air Lines, and for a short period a focus city for TWA . It was also the center for Puerto Rico\\'s international airline, Prinair , from 1966 to 1984, when Prinair went bankrupt.\\n\nIn 1986, American Airlines together with American Eagle established a base in Puerto Rico to compete with Eastern Air Lines. At its peak in 2001, the American hub saw over 60 daily mainline flights, mostly to the mainland, and over 100 daily American Eagle flights, mostly to other Caribbean islands on ATR 72 aircraft.\\n\nWith the expansion of Eastern Airlines and American Airlines facilities, turning Puerto Rico into their Caribbean hub, the historic figure of eight million passengers was reached at the end of 1988. That same year, an investment in expansion and remodeling of $137 million was announced.\\n\nThe 1990s marked the beginning of important projects to modernize and expand the facilities and services of the airport in response to the boom in passenger and cargo movement and growth projections.\\n\nIn the period from 1990 to 2000, several infrastructure works were carried out with an investment of approximately $128 million. Some of these include the expansion of the two-level access road to a maximum of 10 lanes on both levels, the new air traffic control tower (designed by Segundo Cardona FAIA of SCF Architects  ), a parallel taxiway connecting lanes 8 and 10, a parking garage, and the first and second phase of the Terminal B expansion, modification, and rehabilitation project.\\n\nIn subsequent years, from 2000 to 2005, other major projects were initiated and completed such as the third phase of the rehabilitation, modification and expansion of Terminal B and the new B / C connector at a cost of $35.9 million, the construction of a new building for the Air Rescue unit at a cost of $4.1 million, and remodeling the hotel at a cost of $5 million.\\n\nCompetition from low-cost carriers, together with the financial crisis and oil price shock of 2008, led American to reduce its San Juan operation and consolidate its Caribbean hub flying at Miami . American eventually closed its San Juan base and retired its ATR fleet in 2013 as part of its Chapter 11 restructuring.  That same year, the airport received major upgrades, including the new Terminal A, new pavement and expansions, new light systems, press conference rooms, consolidated security area for Terminals B, C and D as well as new fast food restaurants along its corridors. In 2012, the new Terminal A was opened, which is currently occupied by JetBlue Airways .  \\n\nThe Airport is owned by the Ports Authority but since 2013 it is managed by Aerostar Airport Holdings , in a private public initiative through which a contract was granted to that company to operate the airport for 40 years. This was after observations were made by politicians in and outside of Puerto Rico, and comments were made that privatization was a better solution for the airport. Prior to privatization, management was changed each time a different political party in Puerto Rico took office and this caused disruption, and a lack of a long-term vision for the airport.  \\n\nIn January 2024, Frontier Airlines announced the establishment of a crew base in San Juan  \\n\nIn the past, the airport has been served by Lufthansa , Condor , Air France , KLM , Martinair , British Airways , British Caledonian , Virgin Atlantic , Norwegian Air Shuttle , Air Europa , Air Cara\\xc3 fbes , PAWA Dominicana , ACES Colombia , BWIA West Indies Airways , Air Antilles , LIAT , ALM Antillean Airlines , Air Jamaica , Viasa , Aeropostal , Mexicana de Aviación , Volaris , Surinam Airways ,  LACSA , Aerolíneas Argentinas , Dominicana De Aviación , Wardair , Allegiant Air , ATA Airlines , Northwest Airlines , Continental Airlines , National Airlines (N8) , AirTran Airways , Ladeco , Aeronaves de Puerto Rico , Coral Air , Aero Virgin Islands and US Airways .\\n\nOperations\nLuis Muñoz Marín International Airport is Puerto Rico\\'s main international gateway and its main connection to the mainland United States. Domestic flights fly between Carolina and other local destinations, including Culebra , Mayagüez and Vieques . The airport is accessed from the San Juan district of Hato Rey, the island\\'s financial district, via the Teodoro Moscoso Bridge . Old San Juan is accessed via the Baldorioty de Castro Expressway ( PR-26 ). \\nThe airport serves as the Caribbean hub for Cape Air , Air Sunshine , and Silver Airways , a Focus City for JetBlue and an operating base for Frontier Airlines (as of June 2024).   JetBlue is the largest carrier in San Juan , with 51 daily flights on an average day.\\n\nTerminals\nAs of August 2020, Luis Muñoz Marín Airport has one main terminal building with four concourses and a separate terminal with one concourse. However, all terminals are connected. Over the years, the airport has switched between letter designations and number designations. In the late 2010s, the airport incorporated both letter and numbers. The letters are used for the concourses and the numbers used for the airlines\\' departure areas in Terminals B, C and D, Terminal A having its own ticketing area.\\n\nIn June 2012, Terminal A was opened and occupied solely by JetBlue Airways , making San Juan a focus city . The terminal originally had seven gates but an additional gate was added for regional airlines during the renovations of Terminals B and C.\\n\nAs of September 2022, JetBlue uses all gates at Terminal A. Gates A1 and A2 have been used by other airlines in the past such as Copa Airlines and Allegiant Air . Seaborne Airlines and Silver Airways had temporarily moved their operations to Terminal A from Terminal D as renovations and partial reopening took place. All JetBlue flights, both domestic and international, depart from Terminal A.\\n\nAs of June 2024, Terminal A is used by Air Canada , Avelo , JetBlue and Tradewind Aviation .\\n\nTerminal A also houses The Lounge San Juan,  a VIP airport lounge belonging to Priority Pass as well as Gates A1 through A8.\\n\nThis $40 million dollar and 365,000 square foot, fully self contained facility opened in 1985 and was designed as a sole terminal for Eastern Airlines accommodating 11 wide body gates.\\n\nWith Eastern Airlines' demise, the single carrier 11 gate unit terminal originally designed for Eastern Airlines was altered and expanded in three phases to become a state of the art 25 gate facility servicing over 30 domestic and international airlines and a multitude of concessionaires. The expansion of the existing Terminal B, which resulted in a new concourse, then became to be known as Terminal C. \\n\nWhen Terminal B was closed for renovations, airlines were temporarily moved to Terminals A, C and D. Terminal B reopened after a $130 million renovation in December 2014, with Delta , United , Southwest , and Spirit as its first tenants (with all operations moved in February 2015).  \\n\nAs of September 2022, Terminal B is also used by Air Canada . All check-in counters for airlines using gates in Terminals B, C and D are all located within the Terminal and Gates B2 through B10 are located within the Concourse.\\n\nTerminal C was originally built and completed in 1996 as an expansion to Terminal B in an effort to accommodate the growth of American Airlines' Caribbean Hub. \\n\nTerminal C reopened from its $55 million renovation in March 2016.  The letter designation for Terminal C was temporarily discontinued, and the concourse was instead added as an extension to Terminal B.  The Terminal B extension was later changed back to Terminal C.  \\n\nBoth Terminals B and C feature high-end retail stores and new restaurants, improved seating as well as automated baggage scanners currently used only by six other airports in the mainland U.S.\\n\nAn Avianca VIP airport lounge  is located at the entrance of Terminal C. This All-Inclusive lounge is operated by Global Lounge Network.  \\n\nAs of June 2024, Terminal C houses gates C2 through C10 and is used by Air Canada , American , Avianca , Copa , Frontier , Iberia , international JetBlue arrivals as well as local charters.\\n\nThe current Terminal D occupies what were formerly known as Terminals D and E and they were previously occupied solely by American Airlines , its regional affiliate, Executive Airlines , which operated flights under the American Eagle brand, and later both British Airways and Iberia. American Airlines\\' Admirals Lounge continued to operate until March 22, 2014. The former Terminal E area became unused after American Airlines moved their operations to Terminal C in 2015. The American Eagle flights were moved to the previous Terminal D in the late 2000s before being discontinued in April 2013.  \\n\nTerminal D reopened on March 14, 2023, and is mostly used for small and regional aircraft operators such as Cape Air , InterCaribbean Airways and Silver Airways as well as other carriers. The terminal has five gates set up for regional flights and another three gates set up for high-capacity scheduled and charter flights. These scheduled flights include Delta, Frontier, Spirit and United when Terminals B and C are at maximum capacity. The former eastern end of Terminal D has been walled off, and the former Terminal E remains closed off to the public, both still waiting for renovations. The closed terminal areas and baggage claim area still have old American Airlines branding from their hub operations while the former check-in hall has been renovated for access to the airport hotel and parking.\\n\nThe new terminal has a more open ambience which will be used as a basis for future renovations at Terminals A, B and C. The cost of renovations is estimated to be at around $14 million.  \\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\\xe2\\x80 2 Red represents year-round destinations. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Green represents seasonal destinations. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Orange represents direct destinations with stops. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Blue represents future destinations. \\n\n\\xe2\\x80 2 Red represents year-round destinations. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Green represents seasonal destinations. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Orange represents direct destinations with stops. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Blue represents future destinations. \\n\n\\xe2\\x80 2 Red represents year-round destinations. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Green represents seasonal destinations. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Orange represents direct destinations with stops. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Blue represents future destinations. \\n\n\\xe2\\x80 2 Red represents year-round destinations. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Green represents seasonal destinations. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Orange represents direct destinations with stops. \\n \\xe2\\x80 2 Blue represents future destinations. \\n\nStatistics\nMilitary\nAccidents and incidents\nIn popular culture\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The park was named in honor of Puerto Rican statesman Luis Muñoz Rivera . It is the largest public square in the San Juan metropolitan area .  \\n\nHistory\nIn 1917 Law 43 was passed stating a park named Muñoz Rivera Park should be built in San Juan and land was set aside for its creation.  The land once formed part of the city\\'s \" Third line of defense \" built in the 18th century. The powder magazine built in 1769, \" El Polvorín de San Gerónimo \", designed by military engineer Thomas O\\'Daly, is still located on the grounds of the park.\\n\nThe east side of the park is bordered by the Puerto Rican Supreme Court building designed in 1952-56 by architects Toro Ferrer . To the north lies the public beach called El Escambrón Beach , the Parque del Tercer Milenio and the Estadio Sixto Escobar , former home of the San Juan Senators and Santurce Crabbers baseball clubs.\\n\nThe park was designed by Bennett, Parsons & Frost of Chicago in 1925. Its construction from 1926 to 1934 was directed by William Parsons and Francisco Valines Cofresí . The distinctive faux bois park elements and furniture were designed by sculptor Victor M. Cott in the 1930s. Subsequent major restorations have been directed by architects Orval Sifontes in the 1970s, Otto Reyes Casanova in 1990-93, and by Andres Mignucci , in 2000-04, who also wrote about the park\\'s history in his book [Con]textos: el Parque Muñoz Rivera y el Tribunal Supremo de Puerto Rico .  \\n\nIn 2015, then mayor of San Juan Carmen Yulín Cruz announced the park would be used for educational purposes. In late December 2018, the park was the venue for a large fashion show raising awareness for the HIV pandemic .  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nLuquillo, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nLuquillo  is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the northeast coast, northwest of Fajardo ; and east of Rio Grande . Luquillo is spread over 5 barrios and Luquillo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It lends its name to the Sierra de Luquillo , where El Yunque National Forest is located. It is part of the Fajardo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nThe city of Luquillo is 26 square miles and it sits on 12 miles of Atlantic coastline. It is nestled between the blue waters of the Atlantic and the El Yunque National Forest , a rainforest , giving it a diverse and unique ecology. Luquillo marks the beginning of the Northeast Ecological Corridor Nature Reserve which runs down the coast from downtown Luquillo all the way down to the Seven Seas Beach in Fajardo . During certain times of the year, it is not unusual to encounter rare or endangered species of fauna (like the leatherback turtle ) while visiting in Luquillo.  \\n\nHistory\nLuquillo was founded in 1797 and is known as \" La Capital del Sol \" (Capital of the Sun), \" La Riviera de Puerto Rico \" (the Puerto Rican Riviera), and \" Los Come Cocos \" (the coconut eaters). Legend says that the town was named after the Indian cacique Loquillo , who died a few years after the last Indian rebellion in 1513. However, the word Luquillo most likely originates from Yukiyu , the Taino name for El Yunque , most likely meaning \"white mountain\" (i.e. foggy mountain).In 1989, Hurricane Hugo damaged the town.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico.  In Luquillo, rivers were breached, there were landslides, the electrical power collapsed, and 1100 homes were destroyed or damaged. Incidents of looting and assaults were reported in the aftermath of the storm.    \\n\nGeography\nLuquillo is located on the northeast coast.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Luquillo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Luquillo: Barrio Pitahaya, Sector Santo Domingo, Mata de Plátano, Río Chiquito, and Sector Fortuna Playa.   \\n\nTourism\nThere are 14 beaches in Luquillo including La Pared .  La Pared , which translates to \"The Wall\", is considered a dangerous beach.  If you stay on the coastal highway going east from San Juan , you\\'ll soon reach Luquillo Beach , officially known as La Monserrate Beach ( Balneario de la Monserrate ). This huge plantation of majestic coconut palms shades more than a mile of fine and shimmering sand. It is one of the most popular and nicest public beaches in the San Juan metropolitan area . It offers cafeterias, public bathrooms with showers, access for disabled people, and an ample parking lot. La Monserrate Beach is one of the public beaches most frequented by the locals. La Selva, is a small cove on the east coast. It is arguably one of the best surf spots on the east coast. The only way to get to it is about a 2-mile walk through a cow farm, but it\\'s worth the trip if you can talk someone into telling you how to get there.\\n\nEconomy\nCulture\nLuquillo celebrates its patron saint festival in March. The Fiestas Patronales de San Jose is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Luquillo include:\\n\nDemographics\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico, Luquillo is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Jesús Márquez Rodríguez , who was elected at the 2012 general election .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VIII , which is represented by two senators. In 2012, Pedro A. Rodríguez and Luis Daniel Rivera were elected as district senators.  \\n\nTransportation\nThere is no public transportation in Luquillo, and residents and visitors rely on Uber or Luquillo Taxi\\xe2\\x84 2\\xef\\xb8\\x8f & Tours Puerto Rico LLC Luquillo Taxi for service.\\n\nThere are 20 bridges in Luquillo.  \\n\nPR-3 is the main road through Luquillo. Other municipality roads include PR-983, PR-988, PR-991 and PR-940.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nIt consists of three horizontal stripes, the blue top and green bottom are double of width of the yellow central stripe. Blue makes reference to the sky and the sea; yellow represents the sand of its beaches and green represents the vegetation of the mountains . In the center stripe resides the coat of arms of the municipality superimposed and surrounded by two palm tree leaves crossed at the bottom.  \\n\nIn a gold background a centered mountain range with three green mountains is accompanied at the bottom by a bay with blue and silver waves; the top portion of the shield in blue, has three iris branches. Above the shield resides a three tower gold crown. Surrounding the shield by its flanks are two palms trees leaves crossed at the bottom.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The San Gerónimo Powderhouse, built by military engineer Thomas O\\'Daly, dates to at least 1769. This powder warehouse is located in modern-day Luis Muñoz Rivera Park , and it has served many purposes throughout its history from a general warehouse to a history museum to a zoo.  \\n\nAlthough the city walls of San Juan date to 1634, the eastern portion of the Islet of San Juan was militarily unprotected between 1595 - 1598 when Sir Francis Drake and George Clifford, the 3rd Earl of Cumberland respectively attacked the islet until at least 1797 when the British attacked during the Battle of San Juan under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby and Sir Henry Harvey , at the time of the Coalition Anglo-Spanish War .  Although the Spanish and Puerto Rican troops were victorious, this event led to the re-fortification of El Boquerón in the eastern end of Puerta de Tierra.  \\n\nThe San Gerónimo Fortress was built after the British attack in the spot of a battery site known as the El Boquerón Battery, which provided southern fire assistance to the northern El Escambrón Battery . Another battery was built nearby at the site of the modern-day San Antonio Bridge which in the 19th century provided rail connection between Old San Juan and Santurce . Today the San Gerónimo Fortress is located adjacent to the grounds of the Caribe Hilton Hotel .  \\n\nGallery\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMaricao Fish Hatchery\nThe Maricao Fish Hatchery , also known as the Insular Fish Hatchery ( Criadero Insular de Peces ), is a historic 3.32 acre fish hatchery located along the Río Rosario in the Maricao Afuera district ( barrio ) of the Puerto Rican municipality of Maricao , within the Maricao State Forest jurisdiction.  The hatchery is located at approximately 1,500 feet (460 meters) above sea level, 1.2 kilometers from downtown Maricao .  \\n\nHistory\nThe Maricao Fish Hatchery was established in 1937 on three segments of land originally measuring approximately 4 acres along the Maricao River on the northern edge of the Maricao State Forest Reserve by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) for the Insular Forest Service, and under the direction of Dr. Samuel F. Hildebrand of the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce .  The original district consisted of six buildings and additional infrastructure built using stone and concrete as construction materials. The hatchery facilities officially opened in January 1938, and it represents the introduction of recreation fishing or sport fishing in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nThe Government of Puerto Rico added an additional 2.75 acres for the hatchery in 1940, and by 1942, the expanded fish hatchery facilities included large grow-out ponds for breeding fish (particularly brown and rainbow trout ) and sixteen smaller ponds for breeding of crustaceans . At a later date, another grow-out pond was added in the northern segment, west of the original ponds. Reconstruction of these facilities were undertaken between the years 1998 and 2000 after considerable damages caused by Hurricane Georges , which devastated the island in September 1998.  At a later date, a visitor parking was built on a lot across the Maricao River. This visitors parking is not included within the district\\'s boundaries.   \\n\nToday the property is administered by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources . Although the fish hatchery is no longer operational, this district retains integrity of location, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling and association. For this reason, it was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places in 2017.  \\n\nBuildings and structures\nThe Maricao Fish Hatchery historic district has been included in the National Register of Historic Places since February 21, 2017, as it is a prime example of the New Deal Era Constructions in the Forest Reserves of Puerto Rico , a collection of historic sites built by the Civilian Conservation Corps on multiple protected natural areas of Puerto Rico between 1933 and 1942. The fish hatchery historic district includes 28 buildings, structures and resources, out of which 18 are inscribed as contributing properties . In addition to the hatchery ponds, tanks and water channels, the Vivero de Peces historic district consists of an entrance bridge built by the CCC in 1938, a historic entrance stone marker, a series of gazebos and the main administration office buildings. The buildings and structures built after the year 1966 are not included in the historic district designation.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMaricao State Forest\nMaricao State Forest  is a state forest located in the eastern Cordillera Central mountains of Puerto Rico . It is commonly known as Monte del Estado due to the fact that it was one of the first forest reserves in Puerto Rico to be designated a state forest in its official name.  With an area of 10,803 acres (43.72 km 2 ), the Maricao State Forest is the largest of the 20 forestry units of the Puerto Rico state forest system .  \\n\nHistory\nThe Maricao State Forest was created after a proclamation on December 22, 1919, by then Governor of Puerto Rico Arthur Yager .  \\n\nGeography\nThe forest location makes its environment unique in Puerto Rico for its humid climate, its serpentinite soils and its high rate of animal and plant endemicity.  The forest is located on the western region of the Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico and encompasses 10,803 acres (43.72 km 2 ) of land in a high rainfall area through the municipalities of San Germán , Sabana Grande and Maricao . \\n\nIn summer the climate is warm and humid. Thunderstorms are common, along with temperature around 85 °F with heat index in the upper 90s during the daytime. In summer, nighttime is usually cool with low temperature in the mid- to lower 60s. In winter, it is very dry, the forest with mild temperature in daytime and cold in nighttime. Occasional days drop to 40 °F with mid-30s wind chill.\\n\nAlmost 100% of the soils of the Maricao forest are derivates of serpentinite, a metamorphic rock that produces red and argillaceous soil whenever it crumbles down. More than 80% of the forest ground is low in depth and close to the bedrock . These soils are acidic with high contents of iron and aluminum oxides .  \\n\nBiology and ecology\nThere are 1,164 species of plants in the forest. Of the 128 species of endemic plants of Puerto Rico , 23 are in the Maricao State Forest. There are plantations of mahogany , eucalyptus , Honduras pine , and others.  \\n\nThere are 136 species of birds recorded in the park, 23 of which are endemic . Some examples are the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk ( Accipiter striatus venator ), which is an endangered subspecies, and the Puerto Rican emerald ( Chlorostilbon maugaeus ).  \\n\nRecreation\nDue to its location along the Luis Muñoz Marín Scenic Route (better known as the Ruta Panorámica ), the Maricao State Forest offers some iconic panoramic views of the Cordillera Central and the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico.  In clear days it is possible to observe the city of Mayagüez and even Mona Island from the Santa Ana Observation Tower (better known as Torre de Piedra ).  The forest has hiking trails and is featured in Caribbean guides  as an important destination for birdwatching .   Hiking trails are accessible from route PR-120, from the Monte del Estado Ecological Park ( Parque Ecológico Monte del Estado ) and the Monte del Estado Vacation Center ( Centro Vacacional Monte del Estado ),  both of which also provide limited camping and lodging to visitors.   \\n\nIn addition to the Torre de Piedra , other historic attractions within the state forest include the Stone House ( Casa de Piedra ), the ruins of a former architectural gem built during President Roosevelt\\'s Civilian Conservation Corps works during the 1930s,  and the Maricao Fish Hatchery , built in 1937 for research purposes  and now listed under the National Register of Historic Places as one of the New Deal Era Constructions in the Forest Reserves of Puerto Rico (1933-1942).  \\n\nCuret Falls ( Salto Curet ) is an impressive waterfall located along the Lajas River in the northeastern section of the forest reserve.  Other waterfalls found in the forest area include El Pilón and La Iglesia waterfalls.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The bridge has maintained most of its original design and structure over the years. It was constructed in 1903 replacing a wooden bridge that had been at the location since 1853, and served as a road between Toa Alta and Bayamón municipalities, in the 19th century.  \\n\nDescription\nBuilt in 1903, the bridge has not been altered much since its beginnings. Its construction cost $3,000 and 80 men worked on its construction under the direction of Roque Paniagua. In 1909, the contractor José García González added a concrete balustrade at a cost of $644. Its construction in 1903 eased transportation between Corozal and nearby towns of Toa Alta, Orocovis , Vega Alta and Naranjito . This is the oldest, concrete-lowered, arch bridge and one of the most attractive. The bridge span is 25.5 meters (84 ft) long and 4.6 meters (15 ft) wide.

He did not get a good look at her as she got into the back seat of his car. He tried making small talk with the woman but she did not talk until when she finally spoke, it was to ask she be dropped off at the cemetery.

It dates from 1908, and was designed by Antonin Nechodoma .  It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2008.  It is one of four places such listed in Barrio Playa, the others being the U.S. Customs House , the Caja de Muertos Light , and the Cardona Island Light .\\n\nConstruction\nThe church is built in the Neo Gothic heritage. It has a concrete foundation and walls, and a wood and corrugated metal roof.  Built in 1908, the church was built as a house of worship for the Methodist congregation in Playa de Ponce.  The roof was originally built of wood shingles.  The church was named in memory of well-beloved Methodist Bishop Charles Cardwell McCabe , who died shortly before its construction (at a time, also, when the Methodist Church in Puerto Rico was a missional outreach of the Methodist Church in U.S.A.).\\n\nHistory\nThe church was built at this location because of the prominent commercial role that the Playa barrio played in the early nineteenth century. For this reason the La Playa barrio also had fisheries, schools, hospitals, a cemetery, and a population of 5,169 distributed through a residential area dominated by wooden houses. There was also a Catholic church, the Virgen del Carmen Catholic Church, built there in 1882. \"The vital importance of the Port of Ponce explains why it was targeted as an early site for the missionary work of the new Protestant churches that came to Puerto Rico, immediately after the Spanish-American War of 1898.\"  \\n\nThe church lot was acquired on March 31, 1906, after a donation of $400 by Bishop Charles McCabe  Church construction began in 1907, and finished in 1908, at a final cost of $4,500. The locals christened the new church as La Iglesia Metodista de la Playa de Ponce (The Ponce Playa Methodist Church).  \\n\nThrough the years\nIn 1928 the San Felipe hurricane partly destroyed the church.  It was quickly rebuilt by the locals, with the guidance of Catholic parish priest Gonzalo Noel.  Through the years, the locals, regardless of religious affiliation \"have embraced the McCabe Methodist church as one of their icons\".  In 1946, the church inaugurated the McCabe Memorial School, and locals sent their children there regardless of religious orientation. The original facility was known as the Robinson Methodist School, but was later changed to Rev. Julia Torres School, in honor of a local teacher and religious leader.  In 1960, Reverend Julia Torres, born in La Playa, became the first woman in Puerto Rico to be ordained as a Methodist minister. She directed both the church and the school for almost 12 years.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe McCabe Memorial Church embodies the wide historic process of the establishment of the Protestant factions in Puerto Rico.  In this respect, it defied the monopolistic control of the Catholic Church that had prevailed during the Spanish sovereignty over the Island. The church broke previous barriers as to the ideological separation of Church and State, when the opposite was the normal daily experience in Puerto Rican life. The church is also associated with an important icon of twentieth-century Puerto Rican architecture of the time, Antonin Nechodoma.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

During the Battle of San Juan (17 April - 2 May 1797), the town of Miramar was the site of the British ill-fated British assault on the Spanish colonial port city of San Juan de Puerto Rico during the 1796-1808 Anglo-Spanish War.\\n\nIn the 17th century a wide public street, the Central Highway, (today Ponce de León Avenue ) was built that ran through the spring. Commerce flourished since goods that arrived at the port of San Juan had to pass Miramar on their way to the rest of the island. Today two set of bridges known as San Antonio and Dos Hermanos connects the adjoining areas of Old San Juan and Condado . Its land area measures 0.24 sq. miles (0.62 km\\xc2\\xb2), and has a resident population of 5,440 according to the 2000 United States Census .\\n\nMiramar, since its beginnings had large wooden plantation-style homes with expansive land lots. In the 1950s well known architects from the time period built extravagant homes in Miramar that are still preserved.  \\n\nMiramar is home to several structures registered at the National Register of Historic Places , such as Casa Aboy-Lompré , a cultural center that was declared a historic building in the year 1989, focusing on the preservation and creation of photographic art.  Another example is the Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel , declared a historic building in the year 1984.  \\n\nLocation\nMiramar is situated on the northwestern part of Santurce, adjacent to Isla Grande where the Puerto Rico Convention Center is located to the west. Baldorioty de Castro Boulevard and Condado Lagoon are to the north, Alto del Cabro barrios and Gandul are to the east, and Hoare Street is to the south of Miramar.\\n\nDemographics\nIn 2000 , Miramar had a population of 5,540.  \\n\nIn 2010, Miramar had a population of 4,412 and a population density of 18,383.3 persons per square mile.  \\n\nNeighborhood\nMiramar is an exclusive residential neighbourhood where primarily middle to upper-class families reside, characterized by quiet streets lined with large, mature shade trees. There are still a handful of historical residences with the charm and atmosphere from the bygone era including several Prairie School architectural style buildings by internationally renowned architect Antonin Nechodoma . Miramar\\'s rich architectural legacy is now protected by law as it was designated an historical district of Puerto Rico.  The government of Puerto Rico has passed a law declaring Miramar a Historic Town.  \\n\nMiramar\\'s Residents Association has had two legal triumphs in the court system that have helped define zoning laws and development sustainability.  \\n\nThe Justice Department of Puerto Rico (which can be seen in the picture, third condo from right to left, dark colored] is located in Miramar,  and had plans to expand their facilities. Expropriation processes were begun for adjacent lots. The Association took the matter to court and simultaneously began lobbying in the Puerto Rico Legislature. Their endeavors resulted in the passing of a law declaring the historic value of the area, and officially declaring Miramar a historic district. Thus, the courts ruled such zoning laws pertaining to historic districts prohibited the proposed expansion plans. To this day, the adjacent lots are empty, but the department has abandoned their proposed expansion.\\n\nThe second victory for the Residents was in the halting of construction of a four-lane expressway that was begun on the south part of Miramar. The proposed plans were considered to be an abuse of the environment (hundred-year-old trees would have been cut down), the highway would not meet noise emission levels in regular traffic hours (as established by law for historic districts), and various condos and houses would become isolated from the rest of the town.  In an unexpected move, in 2010 Mayor Jorge Santini proposed that instead of building the highway, a green concept should be pursued and a light rail program called SaTour was to be built.  The plan is part of the San Juan Walkable City proposed plan, which is intended to connect Miramar to the Train system already in place called Tren Urbano . When completed, Miramar will have a direct access through train with Hato Rey , Guaynabo , and Bayamón .\\n\nMiramar is home to the coeducational Catholic parochial school Academia del Perpetuo Socorro , the Puerto Rico Convention Center , the Isla Grande Airport , the Cruise ship Pan-American Cruise Pier, the luxurious yacht harbor of Club Nautico,  and the Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music .\\n\nMiramar is located two miles from Old San Juan , three miles from shopping mecca Condado , and four miles from the international airport Luis Muñoz Marín .  \\n\nHistorical Battles\nOn 1797 Miramar witnessed the English Royal Navy under the reign of George III of the United Kingdom and led by the mighty Abercromby shell of the Fortín de San Gerónimo in Old San Juan .  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMona ground iguana\n\\n\nCyclura cornuta stejnegeri ( Barbour & Noble , 1916) \\n\nThe Mona ground iguana ( Cyclura stejnegeri ) is a critically endangered species of rock iguana , endemic to Mona Island , Puerto Rico . It is one of the island nation\\'s few large land animals, and it is the largest endemic terrestrial lizard in the country, and one of the biggest rock iguanas within the Antilles . It was previously considered a subspecies of the rhinoceros iguana ( Cyclura cornuta ).\\n\nTaxonomy\nThe Mona ground iguana belongs to the genus Cyclura . It was named by Thomas Barbour and Gladwyn Kingsley Noble as a species in 1916.  In 1937, Barbour considered it to be a subspecies of Cyclura cornuta , although he doubted it was particularly distinct. Research into scalation patterns in 1977 found little difference between this taxon and the nominate subspecies on Hispaniola, but markedly more differences in the subspecies onchiopsis , and thus found Barbour\\'s 1937 taxonomic interpretation best approximated the obvious relatedness of these taxa.  Its specific name, stejnegeri honors Leonhard Hess Stejneger , who, when writing his Herpetology of Porto Rico in 1902, suspected the rhinoceros iguanas of Mona Island might be slightly different in scale count than those in Haiti, although he was unsure.  \\n\nIn 1993 Robert Powell suggested that all three subspecies of the rhinoceros iguana could be seen as distinct species, if the word \"species\" was redefined to mean any population which was separated from another population. Although it does not appear to be distinct from the nominotypical subspecies morphologically, in a 1999 article, Powell again recommended recognizing this population as a different species, based on what he had said in 1993.  Some authorities have decided to follow Powell.   Still, others consider it a regional variant of the parent species, C. cornuta .\\n\nDescription\nThe Mona ground iguana is a large-bodied, heavy-headed lizard with strong legs and a vertically flattened tail, which is capable of reaching 1.22 m (4 ft 0 in) in length (from snout to tail ).  A crest of pointed, horned scales extends from the nape of the neck to the tip of the tail. The color is a uniform gray to olive drab, with slight brown or blue colorations. Juveniles differ from adults in that they have gray transverse bands across their bodies.  These bands last until they are sexually mature at about three years of age.\\n\nMales possess bony, prominent tubercles on their snouts resembling horns, adipose pads in the form of a helmet on the occipital region of their heads, and large dewlaps . This subspecies, like other species of Cyclura , is sexually dimorphic ; males are larger than females, and have more prominent dorsal crests, \"horns\" and femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones . Thomas Wiewandt, who spent an extended period on Mona Island studying C. stejnegeri , suggested that the horns, along with lateral spines and prominent parietal bulges, function as protective armor against sharp rocks or as defensive tools to facilitate the escape of males from the grasp of one another.    \\n\nHabitat\nMona ground iguanas are diurnal and spend most of the day basking in the sun conserving energy . Mona ground iguanas are endemic to Mona Island; they are scattered through the entire island , though the southwest part of the island is only used during the nesting season. They live a considerable portion of their lives underground, and are usually found in talus slopes, caves and sinkhole depressions. The average depth underground that they can be found is 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in).\\n\nReproduction\nAlthough Mona ground iguanas use the whole island as their habitat, only 1% of the territory , located on the southwest coast, is suitable for nesting because it contains loose sand, and receives direct sunlight. The females bury their eggs in the sand, and the sunlight incubates the eggs. Males reach sexual maturity at a size of 28-31 cm (11-12 in) in length from snout to vent, usually in their third to fourth year, while females mature one year later at a size of 35-40 cm (14-16 in).\\n\nNesting season begins in the second week of June. Usually, one female mates with more than one male in the two weeks the mating season lasts. Copulation may last from 15 sec to 2 mins and 15 sec. One month later, nesting begins. Females will dig a tunnel 0.91 m (3 ft) long located one to two feet underground, where they deposit from five to 19 eggs, with 12 being the average. They will guard their nests for several days, but provide no parental care for the hatchlings , which hatch three months later. Hatchlings measure, on average, 32 cm (13 in) and weigh 73.7 g (2.60 oz) and grow at a rate of 5.23 cm (2.06 in) per year.  \\n\nDiet\nMona ground iguanas, like most Cyclura species, are primarily herbivorous , consuming leaves, flowers, berries, and fruits from different plant species.  A study in 2000 by Dr Allison Alberts of the San Diego Zoo revealed that seeds passing through the digestive tracts of Cycluras germinate more rapidly than those that do not.   These seeds in the fruits consumed by Cyclura have an adaptive advantage, by sprouting before the end of very short rainy seasons.   The Mona ground iguana is also an important means of distributing these seeds to new areas (particularly since females migrate to nesting sites) and, as the largest native herbivores of their ecosystems , they are essential for maintaining the balance between climate and vegetation.   Their diets are very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds, and fungi; individual animals do appear to be opportunistic carnivores.   Fewer than a dozen animal species and 71 plant species are found in the Mona ground iguanas\\' diets.  Mona ground iguanas eat the caterpillar of sphingid moths .  These larvae feed on poisonous plants and are aposematically colored and avoided by other predators.  \\n\nEndangered status\nPopulation numbers are estimated at 1,500 with lower densities than similar iguana-inhabited islands in the West Indies . Immature iguanas are scarce and represent only 5–10% of the population, revealing that the population is aging and in decline.  \\n\nThe biggest threat to C. stejnegeri are invasive species ; feral pigs pose the most serious threat, as they root up iguana nests, and like most Cyclura species, the Mona ground iguana nests communally and at high density.   Introduced goats and pigs are a major competitor for food and overbrowsing by goats also leads to loss of protective cover from birds of prey such as the osprey and predation of juveniles by feral cats .   \\n\nA headstarting program was put into place by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, with cooperation from the IUCN Iguana Specialist Group, the US Fish and Wildlife Service , the Toledo Zoo , and the University of Puerto Rico in 1999, to aid in the recovery of the Mona ground iguana.  From within the safety of this program, the iguanas are reared until they are large enough to survive in the wild, and predators, such as pigs and feral cats, are no longer a threat.  The facility also carries out health screening prior to the release of specimens.  This health screening has been used to provide baselines of the normal physiologic values of the species, identifying potential future problems due to parasites, diseases, etc. which might threaten the population.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

It is the only monument in the Caribbean dedicated as a remembrance of the abolition of slavery. The monument consists of an obelisk and a statue called El Hombre Redimido .\\n\nLocation\nThe monument is located on Avenida Hostos at the fork of Calle Salud and Calle Marina.  It is the centerpiece of Parque de la Abolición and it is located on its grounds, at the park\\'s southernmost tip.  The monument consists of two main pieces, an obelisk and a statue . The obelisk is known as Obelisco a la libertad (Obelisk to freedom).  The statue is that of a black male slave with broken chains depicting he is now a free man. Its coordinates are 18.00573, -66.61276.\\n\nProperties and features\nThe 100-foot high obelisk raises just behind the black iron sculpture of the freed slave that accentuates and gives instance to the occasion. Immediately north of the obelisk is the outdoors acoustic amphitheater known as La Concha Acústica (English: The Acoustic Shell) which completes the park as a triangular city block. La Concha Acústica is an open-air auditorium oftentimes used as a music venue, including presentations by the Ponce Municipal Band .  \\n\nBackground and significance\nSlaves were brought to Puerto Rico from Africa starting in 1513 and through the 18th century to replace the local native \"Indian\" slaves who had been decimated.  The new slaves worked the coffee , sugar cane , and gold mining industries in Puerto Rico. During the 18th century, as gold mining ceased to be one of the major industries in Puerto Rico, slaves worked mostly in coffee plantations and sugar cane fields.  By royal proclamation slavery was abolished on 22 March 1873.\\n\nConstruction history\nIn 1874, a year after the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico, a group of citizens built a small park in memory of the historic event.  In 1880 Olimpio Otero , Juan Mayoral Barnés, and Román Baldorioty de Castro were instrumental in creating the concept for a park dedicated to commemorating the abolition of slavery, the only such memorial in the Caribbean .  Juan Mayoral Barnés brought the idea for the creation of the park to the Ponce Municipal Assembly on 14 March 1880. It was unanimously approved by the Assembly, ratified by the Central Government, and confirmed by Royal Decree on 1 March 1881.  The park had been built in the 1890s and renovated in 1956, under the administration of Ponce mayor Andrés Grillasca Salas . The renovation included the building of Concha Acustica de Ponce and the addition of the statue to stand at the base of the obelisk, in front of it.  The sculpture of the freed slave is the work of Victor Cott Negrón.   The obelisk is built in marble and has a metal tip.\\n\nReferences"

The fire started at the horse barn of the recently deployed U.S. Army artillery encampment one block from the center of town, on Calle Salud between Calle Cristina and Calle Comercio, and quickly spread towards the army\\'s artillery munitions storage area.  By the time the local commander realized there was a fire near the munitions compound, he judged it too risky for his men to try to put it out and ordered all personnel to move away from the area to let the fire extinguish itself, even if it meant explosions at the munitions depot. The commander also instructed the local firemen (then numbering about 40) not to enter the area or attempt to extinguish the fire. However, seven of the firemen and one civilian disobeyed the orders of the commander and decided to fight the fire. They were able to suppress the fire before it could get to the gunpowder reserves, without any loss of life or additional loss of property. Due to their efforts, disaster upon the then mostly wooden homes and businesses in town was averted. For their success, the group was honored many times both in Ponce and the rest of Puerto Rico. The obelisk was built to honor their memory.  \\n\nThe structure\nThe obelisk was built in 1948.  It replaced the original obelisk built shortly after the 25 January 1899 fire, but which was destroyed by the 1918 San Fermín earthquake .

A painting inside Parque de Bombas commemorates the heroic acts of seven valiant \" bomberos \" and one civilian who fought bravely against the voracious fire that threatened the region. Disobeying orders from the American troops that had recently taken control of Puerto Rico, the group was able to appease the flames that had started inside the U.S. Army's gunpowder reserves. Due to their courageous efforts, disaster was narrowly averted.  For their heroic valor and success, the group was honored many times both in Ponce and the rest of Puerto Rico. The mausoleum was built to keep their remains in the after life and honor their memory. Buried in the tomb are the seven firefighters and one civilian who fought the fire. Also buried are 60 other Ponce firemen that have since qualified to be buried there.  \\n\nThe structure\nThe mausoleum was built in 1911. This monument is different from the obelisk unveiled in 1948 and erected at Plaza Las Delicias , which is also dedicated to the same group of men.   The obelisk and statue portions of this mausoleum were rebuilt in 2011, at the 100th anniversary of the original obelisk, statue and mausoleum (1911), and uncovered in time for its 101st anniversary, on 25 January 2012.  The monument had been rebuilt in the 1950s and was rebuilt again in 2011-2012. The 2011-2012 restoration was performed by plastic arts artist Ramón Rivera Cáliz, director of the Secretaría de Arte y Cultura (Office of Arts and Culture) of the Municipality of Ponce.  For this and many other contributions in  the city of Ponce, on 12 December 2013, Rivera Cáliz was honored with a ceremony and added to the list of illustrious Ponce citizens at the Park of the Illustrious Ponce Citizens in Ponce\\'s Tricentennial Park .  \\n\nThe monument is flanked by a 4-foot high foundation and surrounded by 19 3-foot high columns connected by chain segments. The chain segments are adorned with metal stamps depicting Ponce firefighting equipment and the stamps have dates on them. These surrounding columns and chain segments have a total length of some 40 feet on each side and form a square that measures 40-feet x 40-feet. There is also an interior chain located closer to the obelisk itself, this one supported by four 3-foot high columns. There is a marble plaque at the base of the obelisk with an inscription that reads (Note: English translation is not part of the inscription, and it is given here to the right):\\n\nThe segments of the exterior chain have metal insignias with dates on them. Many of the dates are repeated. The dates mark significant events in the history of the Ponce Fire Corps.  The dates include, 2 February 1883, date on which the Ponce Fire Corps moved to what is today Parque de Bombas Museum . Another date is 30 May 1906, date on which the first group of land lots were awarded to Ponce firefighters for the construction of their own homes on Calle 25 de Enero street. A third date is, of course, 25 January 1899, the date of the El Polvorín fire.\\n\nThe mausoleum proper is located under the obelisk, at below ground level. The entrance to the mausoleum contains another inscription, in a two-column format, which reads:\\n\nSpanish Original:\\n\nEnglish Translation:\\n\nHomage to firefighters\nAnother plaque, this one in the shape of a stonehead, protects the final entryway into the tombs of the mausoleum. It reads as follows:\\n\nThe honored\nAll Ponce firefighters with five or more years of service are eligible to be buried in this mausoleum, and 60 rest in it so far, in addition to the initial eight.  The structure particularly honors the following seven firefighters and one civilian from the 25 January 1899 El Polvorín fire:\\n\nReferences\nFurther reading"

The island is protected by the Reserva Natural Caja de Muertos natural reserve because of its native turtle traffic.  Together with Caja de Muertos , Gatas , Ratones , Cardona , Isla del Frio , and Isla de Jueyes , Morrillito is one of seven islands ascribed to the municipality of Ponce .   \\n\nLocation\nThe island, sometimes erroneously termed a key (or, cay ), is located 5.2 mi (8.4 km) south of the Puerto Rican mainland and is part of Barrio Playa   ward of the Ponce , Puerto Rico, municipality . \\nIt is located 590 feet (180 meters) off the southwest point of Caja de Muertos island and has an area of just 0.015 square miles (0.039 km 2 ). The island is connected to Caja de Muertos by a bank of shallow waters about 18.0 feet (5.5 meters) deep.  It is located at latitude 17.88417 and longitude -66.53361.  Its length is 0.31 miles (0.50 kilometers) northeast and southwest.  \\n\nGeography and climate\nThe island is a small 31-foot flat-topped island located 200 yards off the southwestern tip of Caja de Muertos and, when viewed from a distance, Morrillito can easily be mistaken for the 170-ft steep hill (called Cerro Morrillo, Morrillo Hill ) at the extreme southwestern portion of Caja de Muertos proper.

The island was designated as a nature reserve in 1980 after a meeting was held in Puerto Rico by the Puerto Rico Planning Board wherein they considered the recommendation set forth by the Coastal Management Zone Program to turn the island into a protected wilderness area. The island has remained a protected area ever since.  The protection is mainly due to its heavy Hawksbill sea turtle traffic which is an endangered species .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMuseo Castillo Serrallés\n\\n\nMuseo Castillo Serrallés (English: Serrallés Castle Museum ), a.k.a. Museo de la Caña y el Ron (English: Sugar Cane and Rum Museum ),  is an agricultural museum in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico , that showcases the history of sugar cane , its derivative rum industry, and their impact in the economy of Puerto Rico . The most notorious feature of the museum is the building it occupies. The building is a large four-story structure built in the 1930s for the owner of Ponce\\'s Destileria Serralles , one of Puerto Rico\\'s largest rum distilleries. The distillery was once also home to Puerto Rico\\'s largest sugar-factory called Central Mercedita , producers of the Snow White sugar brand.   The building, known as Castillo Serrallés , was designed by Pedro Adolfo de Castro in 1930 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style.  \\n\nThe museum sits on a 2.5-acre lot and opened on 20 February 1991.   Visitors can tour the refurbished home, which has been furnished to appear as it did in the 1930s.  There is also a temporary exhibit area for local artists. The Serrallés Castle is now part of a large complex that includes the Cruceta El Vigía , a Japanese Garden , and a butterfly garden ( Mariposario ).  By September 2010, the museum was receiving around 100,000 visitors per year.  \\n\nLocation\nThe museum sits on a hilltop overlooking the downtown area ( Ponce Pueblo ). Built during the 1930s by order of Juan Eugenio Serrallés, son of businessman Juan Serrallés , founder of Destilería Serrallés , the museum structure sits on a 2.5-acre (1.0 ha) exceedingly manicured property.  The museum is one of the most iconic structures in Puerto Rico and receives some 100,000 visitors a year.\\n\nHistory\nThe house was purchased by the city of Ponce from the Serrallés heirs. While the castle was valued at $17-$25 million,  it was purchased for a mere $400,000 and included much of the furniture in the sale.  The city\\'s initial intent was to turn it into a museum of Puerto Rican music.  The Museum of Puerto Rican Music , however, was eventually established elsewhere in the city.\\n\nThe castle was built in 1926 by local architect Pedro Adolfo de Castro y Besosa.  \\nIt includes two huge terraces , an outside fountain, and a symmetrical backyard garden. Its interior includes a luxurious hall, a spacious dining room, and an interior courtyard .  \\n\nAdministration\nThe museum is administered and operated by a non-governmental, non-profit, civic organization called Patronato de Ponce. The organization received an endowment from the Ponce Municipal Government of $600,000 a year during the 2008-2009 fiscal year, but due to the worldwide economic downturn the Municipality dropped its endowment to $300,000 per year in 2010.  It had also been receiving an undisclosed amount in yearly donations from the private sector, but $75,000 of that was also dropped due to the economy. The museum operates with a $1.2 M yearly budget.  \\n\nDisplays and tours\nAccess to the museum is through the side patio/balcony entrance on the southern end of the building.  The museum can only be seen via guided group tours , and tour guides are very diligent in enforcing this rule as the administration does not want visitors wandering around the house on their own. The only on-your-own time comes at the gift shop.\\n\nThe museum has four floors, and the displays on each floor focus on a particular aspect of the museum and the lives of its former owners.\\n\nThe ground floor, which is the castle\\'s former basement, houses all of the museum\\'s rum and sugar-related expositions. On its northern end is the castle\\'s former 3-car garage now turned into the museum\\'s gift shop . This level also houses the main entrance to the museum on its southern end. On the main, center area are the former service quarters which used to house mechanical, electrical, and water storage facilities. These have been remodeled to provide for the turnstile entry, a restaurant, and an auditorium capable of sitting some 50 visitors. There are also some Patronato offices on this floor.  \\n\nThe second floor contains the castle owner\\'s former library, a central patio, a solarium , the living room, dining room, and the kitchen.  More photos adorn the wall on this level, shown the development of both rum and sugar businesses. This level contains the former formal access to the house via its front main entrance.  \\n\nThe third floor contains all the sleeping quarters. These are shown with furniture as well as all types of personal accessories of the former occupants. Throughout this level are wall-hung pictures of the rum-producing family clan. The pictures here are oriented towards the personal and family live of the clan.\\n\nThe fourth floor is the terrace, from where the most impressive and commanding views of the city are possible. Intended as a relaxed entertainment space, the terrace has both covered and uncovered areas.\\n\nGardens\nThe city also rejuvenated the surrounding landscape.  The backyard now consists of lush green grass, fountains, manicured shrubs, and lights.  The first floor also houses an outdoor square that is covered by the roof over the second floor.  The city uses this area to showcase the work of local artists and photographers. The area is now used for private weddings, quinceañera celebrations, and other similar social events.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The museum was established on 7 September 2006.  \\n\nHistory\nThe museum was established in 2006 under the municipal administration of Mayor Francisco Zayas Seijo .  \\n\nLocation\nThe museum is located within the grounds of the Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro (English: Román Baldorioty de Castro National Pantheon). The Panteon is a tract of land in Barrio Segundo of the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico , originally designed as the city\\'s cemetery , but later converted into what has come to be a famous burial place. Established in 1842, it is Puerto Rico \\'s first (and only) national pantheon.   It is the only cemetery dedicated as a museum in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.  The pantheon, and its Museum of Puerto Rican Autonomism, is located at Number 1 Calle Torres at Calle Frontispicio in Barrio Segundo , Ponce.  \\n\nObjective\nThe purpose of the museum is to trace the history of autonomism in the Island.  In 2009, the municipality also commissioned the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico School of Architecture to perform a study to determine the viability and cost for the total reconstruction of the Pantheon.\\n\nCollections and displays\nThe museum has three main permanent collections. The first one portrays Puerto Rico\\'s quest for national autonomy during the 19th century.\\nThe second collection displays Puerto Rico\\'s national autonomy during the 20th century, and the third wing is dedicated to the autonomy of the Ponce municipal government.  Each display area pinpoints the role of the city of Ponce as the cradle of Puerto Rican autonomism, in particular, the Executive Orders of former governor Rafael Hernández Colón in the development of national autonomism during the second half of the twentieth century, and his leading role of the establishment of Puerto Rico\\'s Law of Autonomous Municipalities of  1991 and the development of municipal autonomy.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe cemetery adjacent to the museum distinguishes itself because various illustrious Puerto Ricans of transcendental importance are buried here. The most important personage buried in this historic cemetery is Don Ramon Baldorioty de Castro , distinguished Puerto Rican patriot, journalist, educator, writer, orator, and abolitionist . In 1870, he was elected delegate to the Cortes of Cádiz , where he attacked the slavery system of the time, being responsible for most of the liberty amendments. Afterward, on 23 March 1873, the abolition of slavery was proclaimed, being Baldorioty de Castro responsible for such proclamation. He is known as the father of Puerto Rican autonomism.  The late mayor of Ponce, Churumba , also an autonomist, has a mausoleum here also.  The remains of nationalist heroe Casimiro Berenguer are buried here as well.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nDownload coordinates as: \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMuseo de Arte de Ponce\n\\n\nMuseo de Arte de Ponce ( MAP ) is an art museum located on Avenida Las Américas in Ponce, Puerto Rico .     It houses a collection of European art ,  as well as works by Puerto Rican artists. The museum contains one of the most important Pre-Raphaelite collections in the Western Hemisphere ,  holding some 4,500 pieces of art   distributed among fourteen galleries .  \\n\nMuseo de Arte de Ponce is the finest art museum in Puerto Rico.  The largest art museum in the Caribbean,  it has also been called one of the best in the Americas .    It was the first museum in Puerto Rico accredited by the American Alliance of Museums .   \\n\nIt was founded in 1959 by industrialist and philanthropist Luis A. Ferré at a location in the Ponce Historic Zone . The museum moved to its current building location on Avenida Las Américas in 1965. In 2010, the museum increased its size significantly after a $30M expansion.\\n\nHistory\nThe project of the museum began in 1956 when Luis A. Ferré traveled to Europe and acquired various European art pieces, including many Pre-Raphaelite works , which encouraged him to start a project for a museum in the city of Ponce , his birthplace. With the advice of two experts - Julius S. Held, specialist on Rubens and professor of Art History at Barnard College and Columbia University , and René Taylor, art and architecture enthusiast and professor at the University of Granada , Yale , and Columbia - Ferré compiled a collection of works of art based on their value instead of their popularity.  Ferré would state in a Forbes interview that \"the scholars and critics all called it kitsch , everyone thought I was crazy to buy them.\"  \\n\nOn 3 January 1959, Ferré opened the museum at a house at 70 Cristina Street in Ponce at what is today the Centro Cultural de Ponce , with an exhibit of 72 works of art.  Some of these original paintings continue to be on display today. As time passed and the museum gained popularity, additional works of art were added to the collections. In 1962, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation donated 15 paintings to the museum.  By 1989, the museum\\'s collection had grown to 500 pieces, with a then estimated value of $50 million,  equivalent to $123 million in present-day terms.\\n\nFearing a fire in the Cristina Street building would destroy its collections, Ferré acquired a tract of land on Las Americas Avenue in Ponce to build the current museum, and recruited architect Edward Durell Stone for its design.  On 23 April 1964 the first stone was placed and the construction of the museum began. It was finished in 1965 and officially opened on 28 December 1965. One of the main features of the museum is its hexagonal galleries, which allow natural light to enter through its corners bringing an illumination to exhibitions. The museum contained a total of 14 galleries, two gardens , and an amphitheater , and its main entrance with bifurcated ladders.\\n\nPinceladas en Vuelo (\"Brushstokes in Flight\"), a 28-foot-high aluminum structure created in 1984 by New York sculptor Roy Lichtenstein sits on the front yard of the museum, which was then considered \"the largest public [display art] work in Latin America and the Caribbean.\"  \\n\nThe museum was closed from 2008 to 2010 while undergoing renovations, re-opening in time for the celebration of its 50th anniversary on 13 November 2010, after a $30 million in improvements.   \\n  In the meantime, the museum held exhibitions in San Juan \\'s Plaza Las Américas , and loaned some of its best pieces out to traveling exhibitions at fine arts institutions around the world.    \\n\nThe construction work was both a renovation of the existing structure as well as an expansion, increasing the size of the museum by more than 40%.   The $20-turn-$30 million renovations also included a new building to house a historic archive and a library.  \\n\nThe new 37,745-square-foot (3,506.6 m 2 ) annex to the museum\\'s main building houses an educational space, a library specializing in art history, the Don Luis A. Ferré Archives, a laboratory for the conservation of artworks, an artwork storage area, a museum shop, a restaurant, and administrative offices.  After the expansion, the total square footage of the museum came to 77,745 square feet.  The expansion intended to provide facilities for educational purposes and an art history library as well as to provide room for a museum shop and a restaurant for guests.  \\n\nThe thoroughfare on which the museum is located, a major road artery in Ponce, was renamed the \" Luis A. Ferré Boulevard\" in honor of the founder of the museum.   \\n\nIn 2021, the museum was named as a recipient for the National Medal for Museum and Library Service .  \\n\nArtworks\nThe Museo de Arte de Ponce houses the most important collection of European art in Latin America.   The Financial Times of London states that the museum holds \"one of the most distinguished private collections in the Western Hemisphere outside the United States.\"  It has  an important collection of almost 4,000 pieces of art that range from the 14th to the 20th century, Italian Baroque , British Pre-Raphaelite ,  Spanish Golden Age and contemporary Latin-American art.\\n\nSome of the artists whose paintings and works are exhibited at the museum are Peter Paul Rubens , Lucas Cranach , Bartolomé Esteban Murillo , Eug\\xc3 8ne Delacroix , and Sir Edward Burne-Jones , among others. The main masterpiece of the museum is Flaming June , painted by Frederic Leighton .  Ferré bought this piece for less than $1,000 in Amsterdam in 1960,  and it was his favorite.  \\n\nThe Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon , the final masterpiece and crowning achievement of Sir Edward Burne-Jones , is another of the main pieces of the museum\\'s collection, originally acquired by Ferré for just 1,600 British guineas in 1963.  The enormous painting was started in 1881 and left unfinished at the artist\\'s death in 1898. In 2009, both Flaming June and The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon were loaned to Tate Britain while the museum underwent a two-year refurbishment.  Other paintings were loaned to the Museo del Prado in Madrid.  \\n\n\"Equally important is the Puerto Rican art collection, which ranges from the 18th century to the present day and includes great masters such as José Campeche , Francisco Oller , Miguel Pou , as well as the best contemporary talent such as Myrna Báez , Francisco Rodón , Antonio Martorell and Arnaldo Roche Rabell , among others.\"  \\n\nThe museum also displays works by international artists. In March 2006, the museum exhibited the work of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo . [ citation needed ] \\n\nThe Museum charges a small admission fee to the public, but most revenues come from substantial donations made by Puerto Rican individuals and businesses. Some have made single donations for the sole purpose of acquiring art to be exhibited in the museum, while others donate for the maintenance and operational expenditures of the museum. A bronze plaque placed in the front entrance and next to the information booth recognizes these donors.\\n\nSelected collection highlights\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

It is preserves the history of the architectural styles of Ponce and Puerto Rico. The Casa Wiechers-Villaronga was acquired and restored by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture . The museum is located in the Ponce Historic Zone . The historic house was designed and built in 1912 by Alfredo B. Wiechers .  The house that is home to this architecture museum is itself an example of the architectural history of the city. The museum is housed at the historic Casa Wiechers-Villaronga .\\n\nHistory\nIn 1912, architect Alfredo B. Wiechers built the Wiechers-Villaronga Residence for his own residence and studio.\\n\nFrom 1911 to 1918, Wiechers was commissioned with various important buildings in Ponce, such as the Logia Aurora, Club Deportivo de Damas, the Teatro Habana , Banco of Ponce building , and Santo Asilo de Damas Hospital among others, where he fully expressed the European Neo-Classical style which he had learned from European training.  \\n\nIn 1919, feeling political persecution from the American invaders, Mr. Wiechers sold the house to Mr. Gabriel Villaronga and moved to his native France. Many generations of Villarongas lived the house through the twentieth century.\\n\nIn the early 1990s, and in order to establish the Museo de la Arquitectura Ponceña, the house was acquired and restored by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (ICP).  In 1996, the museum opened as the home of the Museo de la Arquitectura Ponceña y Planeacion Urbana (Ponce Architecture and Urban Planning Museum).  The goal was to showcase Ponce\\'s rich architectural heritage.     \\n\nLocation\nThe museum is a U-shaped, one-storied structure, measuring 68\\'-10\" in width by 95\\'-2\" in length, located at the northeast corner of Calle Reina and Calle Mendez Vigo. It is one block west of Plaza Las Delicias , the center of the Ponce Historic Zone . Calle Reina has several other historic houses on it, including Residencia Subirá and Casa Miguel C. Godreau .\\n\nArchitecture\nThe structure that is home to the museum is considered a \"treasure trove of culture\",  a jewel amongst the many antique Ponce mansions that have been preserved and converted into museums. The museum possesses elaborate neoclassical details, a majestic roof-top gazebo , and a full set of original and custom-made Catalan modernist furniture. There are also well-preserved shower and bathroom fixtures.  \\n\nBehind all its highly elaborated decoration, with European Baroque influence, essentially the structure is neo-classic in style, making a unique and yet elegant combination of both styles. The museum rests on a rusticated stone podium ; its facades and main walls are of brick masonry with some interior partitions and walls of the gallery and kitchen in wood. Wooden beams supports a galvanized zinc roof. The windows and doors of the museum are wooden with movable louvers and fixed colored glass inlets. A variety of flooring material is used throughout the house: from native cement-colored tiles in the dining area and vestibule , 1\" by 6\" tongue-and-groove wood slats in the living area and bedrooms, and ceramic tiles in the bathroom, to marble tiles at the entry-way.  \\n\nThe Baroque\\'s influence is manifested immediately on the museum\\'s rounded corners, typical of these residence types in Ponce. The corner is framed by two rusticated pilasters and divided into three bays, by two pilaster strips or lesenes . Each bay contains a wooden movable louvreed window with glass inlets at its top, and a floral relief motif over the fenestration . The rest of the wall is decorated with floral garlands . The corner is accentuated with a round sitting nook or \"glorieta\", that is detailed with Ionic columns. Another interesting feature of the house are the balconies which are divided into three sections with Ionic columns and framed with Baroque moldings and sculptured faces on the central top part of the openings. The forged-iron railings of the balconies are elaborated after the Art Nouveau style. The facades are crowned with a continuous masonry cornice . On top of this cornice, a battlement -type parapet with sculptured lion faces and \" candelabra \" decorates the roof line of the structure.  \\n\nSome of the outstanding architectural features present in this museum are highly decorative and detailed pilasters , rusticated podium , cornices , \" candelabra \", relief and motifs , Ionic capitols, etc. They readily depict the Neo-Classical trend of the epoch. The Villaronga Residence is an outstanding example of this style and is one of two residences still standing of a series of houses designed and built by Wiechers, so important to the architectural and cultural heritage of the city of Ponce.  Of special architectural importance is the fact that all the furniture is original, including the bathroom appliances. Most of the furniture belongs to the Modernisme style (Catalan Art Nouveau ) and were imported from Barcelona, Spain .  The hanging tapestry were painted by Librado Net , a famed local artist.  \\n\nThe main entrance is off-centered and located on Reina Street. The entrance hall is decorated with sculptured tiles and the door is located at the end of a marbled stairway. The interior is well kept and unaltered. The interior areas are painted in different colors and the walls have a decorative plastered Art-Nouveau frieze . The ceiling in most of the areas is decorated embossed tin with a continuous decorative molding at its corners. The gallery and part of the kitchen walls are wooden with fixed wood louvered windows used for better ventilation and light. Other interesting details on the house are: the bathroom fixtures, such as the shower stall and the ceramic wall tiles which were imported from Barcelona, Spain , the light fixtures\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as the ones at the dining-room, the master bedroom and living room\\xe2\\x80\\x94which were also imported from Spain, and a \"medio punto\" at the dining area, typical of the architecture of this Southern area of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nDisplays\nThe museum has an extensive collection of displays and photos of master works from the most prominent architects of early 20th century Ponce: Blas Silva Boucher , Francisco Porrata Doria , Alfredo Wiechers Pieretti .  The city of Ponce, considered by some as the \"irrefutable guardian of Puerto Rican criollismo \",  was selected as a member of the prestigious Art Nouveau Route of the European Union for its \"world preservation of modernist heritage\".  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMuseo de la Historia de Ponce\n\\n\nThe Museo de la Historia de Ponce ( Museum of the History of Ponce ) is a local history museum located in the historic Casa Salazar-Candal in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico . The museum depicts the city\\'s ecology, economy, architecture, government, and elements of daily life. It seeks to promote the research, conservation, and dissemination of the historic heritage of Ponce and Puerto Rico.  \\n\nInaugurated on 12 December 1992,  it was the first museum in Puerto Rico established to cover the history of the people of a town or city.  It traces the city\\'s history from the Taino Indians to today. The museum was inaugurated under the administration of Mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago , as part of the tricentennial celebration of the founding of the city.  \\n\nIt is located in the historic district of the city, a short two-block walk from the central Plaza Las Delicias town square, at the southeast corner of Isabel and Mayor Cantera streets. The museum proper is housed in the historic Casa Salazar-Candal but also includes the neighboring Rosali-Zapater house, which houses administratives offices of the museum, in addition to the empty lot that once held the residence of the Schuck Gelpí family.  In 2012, plans were announced to expand the museum into the Casa Rosita Serrallés , an adjacent property.  In 2014, Casa Rosita Serralles (Calle Salud street #67) joined Museo de la Historia de Ponce and opened as \" Museo de la Recordacion Barrio Mameyes \" ( Barrio Mameyes Memorial Museum ) under Ponce mayor María Meléndez .  It is also known as \" Sala Memorial del Barrio Mameyes \" as it operates as a part of the Museo de la Historia de Ponce.  \\n\nHistory of the museum\nThe idea of creating a Ponce history museum dates back to the 1930s, following a citizens group\\'s initiative, but the project did not materialize then.  Interest in the proposal revived years later under Ponce\\'s Secretariat of Culture.  The plan visualized a museum to be constructed on the block bordered by Isabel, Mayor, Cristina, and Salud streets, and Casa Salazar and Casa Zapater, two historic homes, were acquired, as was the empty lot where Casa Shuck Gelpí had once stood. However, the project came to a standstill once again.\\n\nThe plan was revived once again, but with modifications, at the end of the 1980s. This time the project came under the direction of Ms. Maruja Candal Salazar and Dr. Neysa Rodríguez Deynes (curator and founder). They worked in conjunction with a team of curators that included Lizette Cabrera Salcedo, Dr. José Molinelli, Alberto del Toro, and J. A. Figueroa Irizarry, as well as museum specialists Aníbal Sepúlveda, Néstor Barretto, and Jorge Carbonell, members of the Carimar Research Center. The four-year period from 1989 to 1992 saw the restoration of the Salazar and Zapater houses to serve as home to the museum, and the completion of the research, planning, and design of its first four permanent exhibit halls of the museum, namely, ecology, panorama, economic activity, and architecture.  \\n\nIn 1994, the second phase of the project was initiated, under the direction of Lizette Cabrera Salcedo: the creation of two permanent exhibits, one focused on health and one entitled \"Ponce in Puerto Rican Political Life\", in addition to a multimedia presentation \"Ponce is Ponce.\" In 1998, the Ernesto Ramos Antonini auditorium, designed by architect José Bermúdez, was inaugurated under the direction of Lizette Cabrera Salcedo, at the location of the old Shuck Gelpí House.\\n\nCurrently\nBy 2002, ten years after its founding, the Museum of the History of Ponce had become one of Puerto Rico\\'s most active cultural centers,  and Puerto Rico\\'s most complete history museum.  The museum provides a variety of cultural offerings intended to strengthen and increase awareness of the study of Puerto Rican and Ponceño history. As part of the 10th anniversary celebrations, the third and last phase of the museum\\'s development was begun.  It included two permanent exhibits on education and daily life, and the creation of a general museum catalog.\\n\nBuilding\nThe main building that houses the museum has stained-glass windows, mosaics, and interior patios.  Both buildings where the museum is housed are turn-of-the-20th-century homes. The Salazar House dates from 1911 and was designed by Blas Silva Boucher in an eclectic neoclassical style. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places . The Zapater home, on the other hand, represents the criollo townhouse typology. It was built in 1880 and rebuilt in 1925. The Zapater residence was home to some of Ponce\\'s most notable families, including the Clausells , Dapena, Zapater, and Rosaly families. It was also designed by Blas Silva.  \\n\nContents\nThe museum consists of 10 exhibition halls. It showcases facts, documents, objects, and relics of Ponce\\'s history, demonstrating the importance of the city in the development of the history of Puerto Rico, including its intellectual, political, social, cultural, and economic aspects. It also covers the role of the city in the artistic development of Puerto Rican culture in the areas of music, theater, opera, literature, and journalism.  Included in the exhibits are depictions of the ethnic cultures that influenced southern Puerto Rico culture, such as Spanish, African and non-European immigrants.\\n\nThe permanent exhibits of the museum\nThe first exhibition hall depicts the land and climate of the municipality: its coast, plains, and mountains. It shows how the city\\'s natural surroundings are the departure point for learning about its history.  It includes a scale model of the municipality, with illustrations of its fertile soils, natural resources, and native fauna . The curator in charge of this exhibit was Dr. José Mollinelli, with sponsorship by CARIMAR.\\n\nHuman beings make an entrance in this exhibit describing how humans interact with their environment.  The Panorama hall presents the origins of the settlement at Ponce and the evolution of its population from pre-Hispanic times through the beginnings of the 20th century. It includes the regions and countries from which the present inhabitants originated, emphasizing Ponce\\'s heterogeneous populace.  A scale model of the city shows Ponce in its greatest era of development, at the end of the 19th century. The curator in charge of this exhibit was Dra. Neysa Rodríguez Deynes, with sponsorship by CARIMAR.\\n\nThis exhibit focuses on Ponce\\'s role in Puerto Rico\\'s politics and the local political life of the people of Ponce. The exhibit occupies two rooms.  The first illustrates the political development of Puerto Rico from 1508 until the 1950s.  Photographic murals, documents, photographs, and objects reveal the most significant periods in Puerto Rican political life and Ponce\\'s leading role in this development. The second room explains the creation of the Estado Libre Asociado , and the life and work of governors native to Ponce: Luis A. Ferré and Rafael Hernández Colón , as well as Roberto Sánchez Vilella , who claimed Ponce as his adoptive city.  Among the most significant pieces in this exhibition hall is the Prince of Asturias of Literature Prize (Premio Príncipe de Asturias de las Letras), a small bronze statue created by the famous Spanish sculptor Juan Miró .\\n\nOne of the most significant themes in the museum, economic development, is the largest factor in the city\\'s growth from its founding through the present day. The development of the port, agriculture, industry, and banking has supported Ponce\\'s economic development, which in turn has significantly nourished its cultural, social, and intellectual development are evident in this exhibition hall. The curator in charge of this exhibit was Lizette Cabrera Salcedo, with sponsorship by CARIMAR.\\n\nThe evolution of Ponce\\'s urban landscape is illustrated in successive periods of development. The exhibit presents the city\\'s architects and highlights typical elements of Ponce\\'s native architecture. It includes domestic, military , and institutional architecture, public works and the evolution of open space that define this city as a traditional urban center of importance.  The hall includes a scale model of the city\\'s urban development, and a photographic montage including plans, buildings, architects, and art installations. The curator in charge of this exhibit was Architect  Alberto del Toro, with sponsorship by CARIMAR.\\n\nThis exhibit shows the creation and evolution of Ponce\\'s principal health institutions from 1863 until the present day and the medical community from the early 20th century until the 1940s. It also presents significant events in health, such as Dr. Bailey K. Ashford \\'s discovery of the parasite that causes uncinaria ancylostomiasis (local ancylostomiasis) to the country\\'s first kidney transplant. Included in this exhibit are  documents, photographs, prescriptions, professional awards, and personal artifacts once belonging to various Ponce physicians.\\n\nCollections\nThe process of putting together the collections involved over 200 of Ponce\\'s own citizens who lent or donated the photographs, documents, and objects that make up the collections. The current collection has over 3,000 photographs, documents, pieces of furniture, and objects on display in the exhibition halls, or conserved in the museum\\'s storage areas.\\n\nThe most important collections include:\\n\nCovering the period from 1898 to 1950, this collection consists of documents, photographs, and personal objects of Dr. Manuel de la Pila Iglesias that show the evolution of health and medicine in Ponce during the early-to-middle 20th century.\\n\nCovering the period from 1930 to 1980, this collection includes documents, publications, objects, and photographs by the famous Ponce photographer Juan Sisco Santiago, and illustrating the political , social , cultural and economic daily life of Ponce during the second half of the 20th century.\\n\nCovering the period from 1911 to 1950, this collection includes photographs, documents, publications, and personal items of Ponce\\'s first female physician, Ana Dolores Pérez Marchand . Dr. Pérez Marchand was also one of the first three female physician in Puerto Rico. This collection provides a valuable resource for studying the role of women during the early 20th century, and the development of health and medicine in Puerto Rico in general.\\n\nCovering the period from 1900 to 1920, this collection includes postcards by Ponce photographer José Rodríguez Serra. The collection was donated by the Emilio J. Pasarell succession. These offer a visual panorama of Ponce\\'s streets, public and private buildings, plazas, and businesses in the first two decades of the 20th century.\\n\nThis collection covers the period from 1949 to 1970. It consists of correspondence, invitations, graduation cards, newspaper clippings, telegrams, and photographs of educational activities in Ponce between 1949 and 1970.\\n\nThe Ramón López Crespo collection covers the period from 1960 to 1980. It consists of photographs, posters, programs of cultural events, magazines, letters, newspapers, postcards, flyers for musical and theatrical events, illustrating cultural life and events in Ponce between 1960 and 1980.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMuseo de la Masacre de Ponce\n\\n\nThe Museo de la Masacre de Ponce (the Ponce Massacre Museum) is a human rights museum and historic building in Ponce , Puerto Rico . It depicts the history and events surrounding the Ponce massacre , which occurred in broad daylight on Palm Sunday in 1937. The museum is housed inside the building where the event itself occurred, with one of its sections devoted to the Nationalist leader, Pedro Albizu Campos .   It also documents the blacklisting of Puerto Rican Nationalists performed by the United States, as well as hosting a considerable number of photos from the Nationalist era.  \\n\nThe museum is listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in as Casa de la Masacre (the Massacre House).  \\n\nBackground\nAfter the U.S. invasion of Puerto Rico in 1898, the island\\'s political status within the U.S. became a subject of ardent conversation within Puerto Rican political circles. A number of political parties sprung up as a result, with platforms based on their desired relationship to the U.S.\\n\nThe three basic party options were independence, statehood, and commonwealth. The independence movement came to be symbolized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.  \\n\n\"On March 21, 1937, Easter Sunday, this site witnessed one of the most tragic and moving events of our history: The Ponce Massacre.\\n\nOn that day, a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was dissolved by the authorities through a shooting, with a large number of Nationalists and bystanders resulting dead and wounded, as well as two policeman also victims of the incident.\\n\nThe Hays Commission, created to investigate the facts, determined that what occurred at this site was a massacre provoked, in great measure, by the climate of intolerance, discrimination, and belittlement towards civil rights of the government of General Blanton Winship.\\n\nToday, on the fiftieth anniversary of that mournful event, the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture places this memorial as permanent record to the fallen, who offered their lives in defense of their ideals and of the most basic human rights.\\n\nJuan Cotal - Conrado Rivera -\\nJose Antonio Delgado - Ivan Rodriguez -\\nMaria Hernandez - Jenaro Rodriguez -\\nLuis Jimenez - Pedro Rodriguez -\\nCeferino Loyola - Obdulio Rosario -\\nGeorgina Maldonado - Eusebio Sanchez -\\nBolivar Marquez - Juan Santos -\\nRamon Ortiz - Juan Torres -\\nUlpiano Perea - Teodoro Velez -\\nJuan Reyes\"\\n\n- Inscription on the North exterior wall of the Museum\nIn the early 1930s, concurrent with the growing sentiment for Nationalism and independence in Puerto Rico, U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt assigned a new governor for the island: a former U.S. Army General named Blanton Winship .\\n\nGeneral Winship recruited a U.S. military intelligence officer (and scion of the Riggs National Bank) named E. Francis Riggs as his Chief of Police and governed for five years (1934-1939). During this time he engaged in \"an open struggle against the Nationalist Party and a direct persecution of its leadership.\"  Consistent with this open and intense political hostility, \"in October 1935 the State Police in the town of Rio Piedras murdered four [Nationalist] party members\" at the University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras, a neighboring town next to San Juan.  This was known as the Río Piedras massacre .  \\n\nAccording to Jose E. Ayoroa Santaliz in his work Museo Casa de la Masacre de Ponce: En conmemoracion del Primer Cincuentenario de la Masacre de Ponce (Ponce Massacre Museum: March 2011), page 2, the Insular Ponce \"assassinated\" the four men in a pre-meditated fashion and under the direction of the U.S.-appointed Puerto Rico police chief the American colonel Francis Riggs.  \"The Nationalists responded by killing the State Chief of Police, Colonel Francis Riggs, on February 23, 1936.\"  The two young Nationalists responsible were captured and executed at the police barracks in San Juan without a trial, with no law enforcement officer ever being brought to trial for their executions.  \\n\nRiggs\\' death provoked General Winship\\'s outrage. He ordered police raids on every Nationalist Party office in the entire island, with the express purpose of finding evidence that would incriminate the party members in the assassination of Police Chief Riggs - however, no evidence was ever found.  \\n\nDespite the absence of any evidence, Winship\\'s government brought charges of \" sedition \" against Albizu Campos and the other party leaders. Albizu Campos and the others were found not guilty by a jury consisting mostly of native Puerto Ricans.  However, General Winship arranged for a retrial to take place, this time with a 10-2 majority of North Americans on the jury. Conviction was handily achieved, sentencing Albizu to ten years and the others to six years in the Atlanta federal penitentiary . The elimination of the party\\'s leadership, however, stopped neither the Nationalist militancy nor Winship\\'s repression, a situation that resulted in the violent event that took place in Ponce in 1937.  \\n\nThe Ponce Committee of the Nationalist Party had its headquarters at 32 Marina Street.  This was a corner property that bordered Aurora Street, and had been used as the committee\\'s meeting hall for over 10 years. In 1937, the local committee made plans for the annual celebration  of the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico , which had taken place on March 22, 1873.  The date chosen for the 64th anniversary commemoration of the abolition of slavery was March 21, 1937.\\n\nThe Nationalists had received a permit for the parade , which was to take place on Palm Sunday , from Ponce Mayor José Tormos Diego \\'s office. But at the eleventh  hour, Governor Winship instructed the new Insular Police Chief, Colonel Enrique de Orbeta, to contact Mayor Tormos and have him cancel the parade permit. He also ordered Orbeta to increase the police force in the southern city, and to stop, \"by any means necessary,\" any demonstration conducted by the Nationalists in Ponce.  \\n\nThe permit was revoked the very same morning of the activity, but the Party refused to cancel the parade and instructed its participants to form as planned in front of their club house and move on with the activity. The group of participants consisted of the male members of the Cadets of the Republic , the female \"Daughters of the Republic\" group, and a small music band. These - together with their families, friends, and local bystanders - started to assemble around the club house in preparation for the midday parade. Simultaneous with this, some 150 well-armed Insular Police officers positioned themselves strategically so as to encircle the demonstrators.  \\n\nTomás López de Victoria , Cadet Captain of Ponce, was in charge of the Cadets in the parade. Moments before the march began, police Captain Soldevilla walked up and ordered López de Victoria to keep the Cadets from marching. López de Victoria ordered the cadet band to play La Borinqueña , (the Puerto Rican national anthem), and told his Cadets to start their march.  \\n\nIt is believed that a shot was fired by the police to instigate an incident, and to provide an alibi for opening fire on the unarmed Palm Sunday marchers. The police unleashed a fusillade of gunfire into the defenseless crowd. This included fifteen to twenty policemen shooting Thompson .45 machine guns ( Tommy Guns ) for a full ten minutes, wounding almost 200 people and immediately killing fourteen.  Five more died as a result of their wounds during the next few days.  \\n\nThe violent incident in Ponce shook the entire population of the Island despite their political differences. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) came to Puerto Rico and formed a commission consisting of well-respected citizens to investigate the incident, with Dr. Arthur Garfield Hays , President of the ACLU, as the Commission\\'s president.  After months of investigation that ACLU commission determined \"that Governor Winship was directly responsible for the incident; that the Nationalists were exercising their basic right of freedom of speech and association ; and that the killing of defenseless party members and by-standers had to be recognized as a \"massacre.\"  \\n\nThe afternoon of March 21, 1937, became \"one of the saddest\" and the most violent day in the Puerto Rican political struggle for independence.  \\n\nBuilding\nThe Ponce Massacre Museum is the two-story house at the intersection of Marina and Aurora streets where the events took place. It is a  brick masonry and wood building. The Historic Archives of the Municipality of Ponce show a residence at that location as far back as 1886. However the present building, and the building occupied by the Nationalist Party , dates from the early 1900s.  \\n\nBy 1906 the owners of the property contracted Blas Silva , a well-known civil engineer from Ponce, ( Casa Salazar , Casa Wiechers-Villaronga ) to design a new facade and interior arrangement for the property.  The renovations were completed in 1910, but they followed Blas\\' design in part only.  \\n\nAt the time of the 1937 Ponce massacre, the owners were Francisco de Jesus y Graciela Toro Vendrell. In 1945 the property was sold to Juan Riera Ginard and Carmen M. Toro de Riera, who never occupied the house but instead used it as a source of rental income. The house was rented out in two units: the first floor as commercial space and the second floor as residential unit.\\n\nIn 1987, the Puerto Rico Legislature passed Joint Resolution Number 2951, designating the property a national historic landmark . In 1988 the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture purchased the property, reconditioned it, and subsequently converted it into the Museo de la Masacre de Ponce.  The architectural style is Vernacular Creole .\\n\nThe museum was temporarily shut in 2006 for restoration and repairs. Subsequent to a $275,000 renovation, the museum re-opened in 2013.  \\n\nThe building sustained damage due to the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquake .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\n\\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMuseo de la Música Puertorriqueña\n\\n\nThe Museo de la Música Puertorriqueña (English: Museum of Puerto Rican Music) is a museum in Ponce, Puerto Rico , that showcases the development of Puerto Rican music , with displays of Taíno , Spanish, and African musical instruments that were played in the romantic danza genre, the favorite music of 19th-century Puerto Rican high society, as well as the more African-inspired bomba and plena styles. Also on display are memorabilia of composers and performers.  The Museum traces the rich musical history of Puerto Rico through memorabilia of prominent musicians and displays of the musical instruments associated with the three genres of music that originated in this Caribbean island.  \\n\nThe building that houses the museum is known as Casa Serrallés and it was the former downtown residence (as opposed to his hilltop Castillo Serrallés structure) of Juan Eugenio Serrallés and his family, owners of Destilería Serrallés and makers of the Don Q rum.  \\n\nHistory\nIn 1986, the Ponce Municipal Government purchased the Castillo Serrallés to turn it into the Museum of Puerto Rican Music.  However, the idea of turning Castillo Serrallés into a music museum was subsequently discarded.\\n\nIn 1991 the first headquarters of the Museo de la Musica Puertorriqueña were located at 70 Cristina Street in what is now the Centro Cultural de Ponce .   The pastel villa building was built by a well known architect named Juan Bertoli Calderoni , who also built many other buildings throughout Puerto Rico.  It was designed in the neo-classic architectural style,  specifically a French style architecture.  \\n\nIn 1996, the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña (ICP) moved the Music Museum to its current location at Isabel and Salud streets.  The current structure, acquired by the ICP, was built as the residence of the Serrallés-Nevárez family.  Félix Juan Serrallés, who married Francisca Nevárez, was a prominent local industrialist, and himself the grandson of prominent businessman Juan Serrallés , the founder of the Destilería Serrallés rum company. This house on Calle Isabel was the Serallés family\\'s everyday downtown Ponce residence, as compared to their hilltop Serralles Castle residence.  The back yard of the property still preserves an outdoors bar-like area complete with the Destileria Serrallés and Don Quixote logo. \\n\nMuseo de la Música Puertorriqueña is not to be confused with Museo de la Música, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico , also known as Museo de la Música Rafael Ithier, an $18 million museum project by the Guaynabo municipal government which failed to open and was abandoned in March 2020.  \\n\nMuseum\nThe building was restored in 1990 by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture with the goal of paying tribute to the works of Puerto Rican musicians in the most honorable way possible. The building is easily spotted as it is housed in a pastel-colored villa , intentionally meant to attract visitors. The museum exhibitions are presented in both Spanish and English.  The museum building is located at the southeast corner of Isabel and Salud streets.\\n\nThe museum is \"designed to produce the necessary visual and auditory impact on the audience so as to maximize the potential to draw the actual value of the unique Puerto Rican music\". The distinctive Puerto Rican music is often exported to other islands in the Caribbean . It is also widely played throughout other parts of the world, especially in the United States.  The displays show how Puerto Rican music started and how it has developed over the years. Some of the instruments displayed are the güicharo or güiro , which is a gourd that has been hollowed out, and variants of the original six-string Spanish guitar-like instruments the requinto and bordonua .  \\n\nOn 15 September 2004, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved Law 307 where by the ICP continued to maintain ownership of the Museo de la Musica property (as well as ownership of Casa de la Masacre de Ponce, Casa Wiechers-Villaronga and Casa Armstrong-Poventud ), but the municipal government was to become responsible for the security, preservation and maintenance of the structure.  \\n\nHonors\nIn June 2012, the Senate of Puerto Rico approved Resolución Conjunta del Senado 957 (Joint Senate Resolution 957) to rename the Museo de Música Puertorriqueña as Museo de la Música Puertorriqueña Ruth Fernández in honor of the singer.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\n\\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nNormandie Hotel\n\\n\nThe Normandie Hotel is a historic building located in the Isleta de San Juan , in San Juan, Puerto Rico which opened on October 10, 1942 as a hotel. Its design was inspired by the French transatlantic passenger ship SS Normandie in addition to featuring the same art deco design as the ocean liner that inspired it, and the hotel\\'s original roof sign was one of the two signs that adorned the top deck of the SS Normandie but were removed from it during an early refitting.  It is an example of what came to be known as the Streamline Moderne architecture style.\\n\nAs of 2021 [update] the building was vacant and not in operation and in 2022, was sold to private owners who said they plan to renovate it.\\n\nHistory\nThe Normandie Hotel was the brainchild of Puerto Rican engineer Félix Benítez Rexach .  He married the French singer Lucienne D\\'Hotelle [ fr ] in 1927 or 1928;   reportedly, he built the hotel as a wedding present for his bride.  He served as the president of the Escambron Development Company, which was incorporated in approximately 1943 to issue bonds to finance the completion of the hotel. Escambron owned and operated the hotel.  \\n\nThe hotel was designed by architect Raúl Reichard (1908-1996) and construction began in 1938. The hotel\\'s exterior was designed to resemble the famed luxury ocean liner,  elongated and curved in front and back, with porthole-shaped lights on the facade of the 6th floor, as well as on the front on all floors except the front entrance and 2nd floor. Inside, the hotel features art deco design, complete with Roman , Egyptian , and French details, high ceilings, corridors looking down into a central skylighted atrium , banisters that resemble those on ships on the edges of all floors except the lobby, a pool outside in the back shaped similarly to the hotel\\'s, and had blue or orange awnings above the windows on the upper floors until the hotel closed in the 1960s.\\n\nDesigners and artists from Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, France, and Spain all contributed to the hotel\\'s overall construction. When it opened on October 10, 1942,  it became an instant sensation among the island\\'s social elite. Completed at a cost of more than US$2,000,000, the hotel catered to many major Hollywood and Latin American film stars such as Cantinflas , Libertad Lamarque and Jorge Negrete . The hotel also served as a performing arts venue for many of Puerto Rico\\'s top entertainers, such as Ruth Fernández , Myrta Silva , Sylvia Rexach , and Carmen Delia Dipini .\\n\nThe coastline of Puerto Rico was expropriated by the federal government for defense during World War II, including the hotel, and Benítez Rexach, who had moved to the Dominican Republic in 1944, reportedly protested by refusing to pay his property taxes.  However, court records indicate Benítez Rexach had argued unsuccessfully that as an American citizen without congressional representation, he was exempt from federal taxes.  After being closed and abandoned in the 1970s,  the hotel was restored in the early 1990s. Afterwards, it underwent massive renovations due to heavy damage caused by Hurricane Georges in 1998. After storm-related damages were repaired, the hotel remained in business until 2004, when another renovation project commenced. In early 2005, the 173-room hotel reopened after its refurbishing and would operate as a Boutique Hotel for 4 years, before closing again by late 2010, since then the hotel has remained unused and vacant for over a decade.  \\n\nThe Normandie Hotel was purchased on August 8, 2013, by Ben Medetsky and Jack Polatsek of Interra Capital Group for nearly US$4,000,000 but after initial plans for redevelopment of the hotel, the group decided to sell it.   In 2015, the owners removed the hotel\\'s historic roof sign in order to protect and preserve it, and only the structure that held up the letters of the sign remains.  Although various groups of investors attempted to purchase the property in 2014,  then in the spring of 2017  and again in the spring of 2018,  it wasn\\'t actually sold until January 2022.  \\n\nMajority Leader \\xc3\\x81ngel Matos García ( PPD ) filed Joint House Resolution 0089 in March 2021; if passed, the Puerto Rico Department of Economic Development and Commerce would seize the property and demolish the hotel.  The Institute of Puerto Rican Culture made a statement opposing the resolution two days later.  Later that year, despite rumors to the contrary, Hard Rock International denied that it was interested in the hotel.  The hotel was purchased by the Ishay Group for US$8.6 million, who plan to restore the hotel and reopen it, possibly converting some rooms into residences.  \\n\nRecognition\nThe Normandie Hotel was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1980.   and to the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.  \\n\nPopular culture\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

The design of the chapel was made by Czech architect Antonin Nechodoma , who lived in Puerto Rico. The chapel was finally opened in 1908.\\n\nInitially, the chapel was used by a Methodist Episcopal church . After that, it was occupied by the Union Church. Owners Pedro Santiago and Catalina Mejía de Santiago gave the building as a present to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan de Puerto Rico on February 17, 1959.  \\n\nDue to its unique architecture and historic nature, the chapel was included on the National Register for Historic Places on September 25, 1984,  and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones on February 3, 2000.  \\n\nIn 1982, the chapel was already abandoned and deteriorated. Elba Armstrong started an initiative to restore it. Along with members of the Lourdes Association, the restoration project had a cost of $24,300. Armstrong worked with architect Pablo Ojeda O\\'Neill and with the contributions of private and government entities.\\n\nIn 1987, the final restoration of the 24 stained-glass windows was done with a $13,500 donation of Angel Ramos Foundation. From 1990 to 1991, thanks to a $10,000 donation from the Senate of Puerto Rico , along with $5,000 more from Angel Ramos Foundation, the asbestos portions of the roof were replaced.\\n\nIn 1992, the Jesus and the Children and the Holy Spirit stained-glass windows were restored, with a $22,000 donation from Esso Standard Oil Company . The damaged frame of the windows was also built anew. 1993 saw the altar floor replaced by new wooden floors, identical to the original ones. This was achieved with a $19,000 donation from the Puerto Rican Committee for the Fifth Centenary of the Discovery of Puerto Rico. Also, a mosaic similar to the one in the main hall was found and installed in the side hall, the sacristy , and the bathroom.\\n\nThe furniture and the doors from the sacristy were designed by Ojeda and built in mahogany , and the bell was built in Spain .\\n\nArchitecture\nThe structure features a bell tower with four gargoyles that serve as a drainage system for the rain water. The tower itself features double arches with slight points. The main facade also features a stained-glass window with a smaller one on top. A celtic cross rests at the pinnacle of the church. The side windows also have stained-glass windows. The interior is simple with wood finishes.

The forest is located east of the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden in the Sabana Llana Sur district of San Juan ,  making it one of the two state forests located within the capital\\'s municipal boundaries (the other being San Patricio State Forest ).  \\n\nHistory\nThe area where the forest now stands had originally been deforested and was the site of several quarries. The forest reserve was first proclaimed in 1998 with the intention of preserving one of the last green areas in San Juan as a secondary forest . The city is very densely populated and has lost most of its forests due to urban sprawl . This was done thanks to the effort of local residents, academics and environmentalists. In 2003 the forest was added to the San Juan Ecological Corridor management zone, also managed by the municipality of San Juan which designates the area as ecologically important as it forms part of the hydrological basin of the estuary of San Juan Bay .  Between the years 1998 and 2005 the forest was used for research purposes for studying the impact of Hurricane Georges in the destruction and regrowth of the forest.  \\n\nEcology\nThe forest is very characteristic of the secondary forest ecosystem found throughout Puerto Rico. Some native tree species found in the forest are the yarumo ( Cecropia schreberiana ), the West Indian locust tree ( Hymenaea courbaril ), the Puerto Rican royal palm tree ( Roystonea borinquena ), and the pink trumpet tree ( Tabebuia heterophylla ) or Puerto Rican oak as it is colloquially known. Common introduced trees found in the forest are the flea tree ( Albizia lebbeck ), the karoi tree ( Albizia procera ) and the Malay pterocarpus ( Pterocarpus indicus ).  \\n\nThe forest is home to native species such as the zenaida dove ( Zenaida aurita ), the scaly-naped pigeon ( Patagioenas squamosa ), the gray kingbird ( Tyrannus dominicensis ), the northern mockingbird ( Mimus polyglottos ), bananaquits ( Coereba flaveola ), red-tailed hawks ( Buteo jamaicensis ) and the Puerto Rican mango ( Anthracothorax aurulentus ); endemic species such as the Puerto Rican woodpecker ( Melanerpes portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican spindalis ( Spindalis portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican tanager ( Nesospingus speculiferus ) and the green mango hummingbird ( Anthracothorax viridis ); and migratory species such as the black-and-white warbler ( Mniotilta varia ), the Caribbean martin ( Progne dominicensis ) and the black-whiskered vireo ( Vireo altiloquues ). The forest is also home to several reptile and amphibian species such as the Puerto Rican crested anole ( Anolis cristatellus ) and the common coqui ( Leptodactylus albilabris ).\\n\nRecreation\nAlthough being located next to the San Juan Botanical Garden , the urban forest is not usually open to visitors and those interested in visiting it should contact the forest offices to arrange a visit (787-772-2009). The forest offers great opportunities for birdwatching and nature photography for those who do visit.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

Parque Barbosa, also known as Ultimo Trolley (Last Tram) is the home of the Ocean Park Marlins Futbol Club, a football team with categories from 5-year-old kids to \"Superior\" (semi-professional) both for female and male footballers. \\xc3\\x9altimo Trolley got its name because it was the last electric streetcar that crossed the streets of San Juan from 1901 to 1946 and was placed in the park and operated as a restaurant.

It is by the Piedras River , next to the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden . This aqueduct dates to the mid 19th century and it was important for the urban development of Río Piedras .   \\n\nHistory\nThe development of an aqueduct at the site by the Piedras River dates to 1825 and it was important to the urban development of Río Piedras , then known as El Roble. The waterworks were critical for their supply of clean water  which was fundamental to the city\\'s growth along a main corridor that still exists as Ponce de León Avenue . The original design of the existing aqueduct structure dates to 1847 and was designed by engineer Juan Manuel Lomber. The waterworks went through many upgrades since then done by American British engineers that were completed by the time of the Spanish-American War of 1898, with some main components installed some years later, between 1917 and 1918.   \\n\nThe Puerto Rico Conservation Trust ( Para la Naturaleza ) currently manages 9 out of the 23 acres of the historic site, and since 2007 has been working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to preserve the site. The nonprofit organization proclaimed the historic district a National Treasure in 2014.   Current plans for the district include the restoration the site\\'s facilities for use as a visitor center dedicated to research, recreation, and education about the benefits of water resource conservation.  \\n\nThe aqueduct and its surrounding buildings were added as the Acueducto de San Juan historic district to the National Register of Historic Places on June 21, 2007.  The historic district is composed of a small weir that supplied water from the Piedras River; a valve room; six sedimentation and filtration tanks; an engine room with its carbon deposit; and an employee house.   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nOld San Juan\nOld San Juan  is a historic district located at the \"northwest triangle\"  of the islet of San Juan in San Juan . Its area roughly correlates to the Ballajá , Catedral , Marina, Mercado , San Cristóbal , and San Francisco sub-barrios (sub-districts) of barrio San Juan Antiguo in the municipality of San Juan, Puerto Rico . \\n\nOld San Juan is the oldest settlement within Puerto Rico and the historic colonial district of the city of San Juan. This historic district is a Puerto Rico Registered Historic Zone and a National Historic Landmark District , Old San Juan Historic District , and is also listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places .  Several historical buildings and structures, particularly La Fortaleza , the city walls , and El Morro and San Cristóbal castles, have been inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list since 1983.  \\n\nHistorically the mixed-use commercial and residential real estate in the main street s of Calle Cristo and Calle Fortaleza from Calle Tanca to the Governor's Mansion is the most valuable in the area and it has kept its value and increased steadily through several years despite the past economic turmoils.\\n\nLocation\nOld San Juan is located on a small and narrow island which lies along the north coast, about 35 miles (56 km) from the east end of Puerto Rico, and is united to the mainland of Puerto Rico by three bridges. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and to the south by San Juan Bay (or \"Bahia de San Juan\")\\xe2\\x80\\x94which lies between the city and the mainland. On a promontory  about 100 feet (30 m) high, at the west end of the island and commanding the entrance to the harbor, rise the battlements of Fort San Felipe del Morro , in which there is a lighthouse.\\n\nThe \"Caño de San Antonio\" lies to the southeast, where the island of Old San Juan connects to the mainland through Santurce , by three bridges, \"Puente Dos Hermanos\" (Ashford Avenue), \"Puente G. Esteves\" ( Ponce de León Avenue ) and \"Puente San Antonio\" (Fernández Juncos Avenue).\\n\nThe city is characterized by its narrow, blue cobblestone streets, and flat-roofed brick and stone buildings, which date back to the 16th and 17th centuries\\xe2\\x80\\x94when Puerto Rico was a Spanish possession. Near Fort San Felipe del Morro, is the Casa Blanca , a palace built on land which belonged to the family of Ponce de León .\\n\nHistory\nIn 1508, Juan Ponce de León founded the original settlement, Caparra  (named after the Province of Cáceres , Spain , birthplace of the then-governor of Spain\\'s Caribbean territories, Nicolás de Ovando ). The ruins of Caparra are known as the Pueblo Viejo sector of Guaynabo , behind the almost land-locked harbor just to the west of the present San Juan metropolitan area. In 1509, the settlement was abandoned and moved to a site which was called at the time \"Puerto Rico\" (meaning \"rich port\" or \"good port\"), a name that evoked that of a similar geographical harbor in the island of Gran Canaria , Canary Islands . In 1521, the name \"San Juan\" was added, and the newer settlement was given its formal name of \"San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico\", following the usual custom of christening the town with both its formal name and the name which Christopher Columbus had originally given the islands, honoring John the Baptist . [ verification needed ] \\n\nConstructed in 1521, Casa Blanca served as the first fortification of the settlement and residence of Juan Ponce de León descendants, until the mid-eighteenth century.    \\n\nLa Fortaleza was built between 1533 and 1540, which was followed by the construction of a battery at \"the Morro.\" Plans for the castle portion of San Felipe del Morro were made in 1584. Extensions to the Morro, plus construction of El Cañuelo , and El Boquerón , were made between 1599 and 1609. Circumvallation of the city commenced in 1630 and was concluded by 1641. San Cristobal fort was completed by 1771.  \\n\nBy 1776, the population totaled 6000, half of which were soldiers. The garrison town of San Juan included 250 acres of military installations and 62 acres of public and private use. By 1781, the city\\'s fortifications included 376 cannon. By 1876, 24,000 lived inside the walls of San Juan, encompassing 62 acres, and 926 buildings.  \\n\nPrior to the 19th century, the area outside the city walls occupying the east side of Old San Juan Island, was almost uninhabited. In 1838 the so-called area of Puerta de Tierra (or \"Land Gate\") had a population of 168 residents, mainly of African descent.  According to a census made in 1846, the population had risen to 223 inhabitants living in 58 houses. On March 3, 1865, the municipal government of San Juan approved a resolution promoting the city expansion across the Puerta de Tierra which included the plan for demolishing the city walls along the eastern side.  On May 28, 1897, the wall demolition was officially started after a proclamation was issued by Queen Maria Christina .  By the year 1899, the population of Puerta de Tierra had risen to 5,453; while the area comprising the old walled city had a civilian population of roughly 18,103 inhabitants.\\n\nDuring the late 1940s, disrepair in the old city was evident. The local authorities were considering development proposals for renovating the old city and incorporating modern architecture on new constructions. Anthropologist Ricardo Alegría vehemently advised against the idea of demolishing old colonial buildings in favor of contemporary building designs. He followed the example suggested by his father, a local civic leader who had successfully prevented the demolition of the Capilla del Cristo in favor of a traffic redesign. He advised mayor Rincón de Gautier in having local zoning laws changed to favor remodeling and the incorporation of Spanish colonial motifs in any new construction. This helped preserve the city\\'s architectural profile, and has been a key to San Juan\\'s current status as a tourist destination. [ citation needed ] \\n\nLuis Muñoz Marín , as a senator and later as governor of Puerto Rico, supported and implemented what became known as Operation Bootstrap , which included the development of the tourism industry. In 1948 the government invited one of the organizers of Colonial Williamsburg to lead its tourism development efforts.  These efforts were further supported by the 1955 creation of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture ( Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña ) head by Alegría. He sought legal and administrative changes that would allow for major remodeling efforts to be successful. At the time, most real estate in Old San Juan had devalued under appraised values because the city was perceived as unsafe (particularly because of building disrepair and social ills such as prostitution ) and not profitable for business (because of rent control statutes, as well as the reluctance of commercial banks to fund remodeling). Under combined efforts by the institute and the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, \"model\" remodelings were made to show potential property owners how their renewed properties could look. Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. As with other Operation Bootstrap projects, mainland corporate investors were lured in with tax breaks and other incentives. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared a historic building, and asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. As in other Operation Bootstrap projects, the Woolworth family was invited in 1957 to reconstruct the former convent (which had more recently been a low-rent apartment building and city garage) into the luxury Hotel El Convento .  The Bank provided low interest loans to remodelers, and the government gave triple tax exemptions to commercial activities in the old city (they were exempted for a limited time, not only from property taxes and municipal taxes, but from income tax from activities generated in their properties as well). At least one retailer from the shopping district in Charlotte Amalie was given incentives to set up shop in the Calle del Cristo (the city\\'s red light district during the early 1940s) in order to persuade other retailers to follow suit and somehow \"clean up\" the district. Potential developers were offered sketches of their properties after a remodeling, as to suggest which architectural elements to improve or change. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in Latin America, particularly Havana , Lima and Cartagena de Indias .\\n\nHistoric designations\nThe San Juan National Historic Site  was established in 1949 to preserve historic fortifications in Old San Juan and the National Register of Historic Places listed it in 1966.  Both that site and La Fortaleza ( English : The Fortress ) were then declared a single World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983.  \\n\nIn 1951, the broader area within the old city walls became the first listing of the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones as the Zona Antigua Histórica Casco de San Juan ( English : Historic Old Town Area of San Juan ).  In 1972, the same area was recognized by the National Register of Historic Places as the San Juan Historic Zone .  In 2012, the National Register increased the boundaries and renamed the district to Old San Juan Historic District .  Old San Juan was then designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2013.  \\n\nLandmarks and attractions\nLa Perla (Spanish for the pearl ) is a former shanty town or informal settlement located along the northern section of the historic San Juan city walls. Originally the site of slaughterhouses, the area was later settled by freed slaves and non-white servants in the 18th century. In the 20th century the community grew to become a neighborhood of Old San Juan and its reputation has recently transformed from a dangerous place into a cultural hub. It has appeared on films, literature, TV shows and music videos .  \\n\nToday\nWith its abundance of shops, historic places, museums,  open air cafés, restaurants, colorful homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectural peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for domestic and international tourism.\\n\nThe district is characterized by numerous public plazas, which are filled with local shops that sell traditional craftwork,   sculptures and typical musical instruments. Moreover, Old San Juan is known for its historical churches, such as San José Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista , which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer and first European to discover modern day Florida , Juan Ponce de León .\\n\nTourists\\' main spot to visit at Old San Juan is Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a fort built by the Spaniards when settled on the Island. Besides the magnificent fort, tourists are drawn to La Perla , a colorful neighborhood outside of the historic city wall.\\n\nOld San Juan is one of the two barrios , in addition to Santurce , that made up the municipality of San Juan after 1864 and prior to 1951, in which the former independent municipality of Río Piedras was annexed.\\n\nBlockhouses and subbarrios\nThe oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts, such as the Fort San Felipe del Morro , Castle of San Cristóbal , and el Palacio de Santa Catalina (also known as La Fortaleza ), acted as the primary defense of the settlement which has been subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the Governor of Puerto Rico . Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site .  Old San Juan\\'s land area roughly correlates to the following subbarrios of barrio San Juan Antiguo: Ballajá, Catedral, Marina, Mercado, San Cristóbal, and San Francisco.\\n\nPublic transportation\nOld San Juan is the location for one of two transportation hubs serving Metropolitan San Juan. At one time, a free trolley provided limited service to Old San Juan seven days a week but is not available any longer. People get around the city on foot or by car.  There have been plans to turn the historic district into a pedestrian-only zone , and to either rebuild the trolley system or build a new light-rail train system in the recent years.  \\n\nPopular culture\nOld San Juan is the setting for films, books, song lyrics and music videos, including the following:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nOrocovis, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nOrocovis (from the Taino chief Orocobix ) is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the center of the island. Founded by Juan Rivera de Santiago in 1825. Orocovis is spread over 17 barrios. It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . It\\'s located north of Villalba and Coamo ; south of Morovis and Corozal ; southeast of Ciales ; east of Jayuya ; and west of Barranquitas \\n\nHistory\nSince before the Spanish colonization in the 16th century , the Taíno were already established in the region. They were led by the cacique Orocobix and his tribe known as the Jatibonicu . After Spaniards settled in the island, the region was part of the south of Manatí and the north region of Coamo. By 1823 Orocovis was a barrio of Barranquitas while Morovis (previously part of Manatí) had a barrio called Barros .  Both Orocovis and Barros were eventually united to establish a new town.\\n\nIn early 1825, Juan Rivera de Santiago sought and obtained legal power by the neighbors of the region to request the Governor authorization to found a municipality in the Barros area, where they had bought 14 acres of land from Eulalia (Olaya) de Rivera Melendez, who donated an additional acre to establish several municipal works. However, due to the distance from bodies of water, the settlement was moved to another place where it is today. On November 10, 1825, Governor Miguel de la Torre granted permission to found the new municipality of Barros.\\n\nIn 1838, the parish of San Juan Bautista de Barros was created and was blessed and inaugurated on October 29 of the same year. However, in 1875, a fire destroyed the church, the King\\'s House, the priest\\'s house and several homes.\\n\nMost of Orocovis nicknames stem from its location in the center of the island. Some of them are: \" Corazón de Puerto Rico \" (Heart of Puerto Rico) and \" Centro Geográfico de Puerto Rico \" (Geographical Center of Puerto Rico). Locals say the center of Puerto Rico is in a barrio called Pellejas , on Road 566 , Km 5.7 in Orocovis. That the center of Puerto Rico is in front of the Catholic church was determined to be false by engineers from the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus . [ citation needed ] \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Barros, as Orocovis was then called, was 14,845.  \\n\nIn 1928, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a resolution to change the name of Barros to Orocovis , to honor the Taíno cacique of the same name, who lived in that region.\\n\nGeography\nThe municipality Orocovis is mountainous with many valleys. Most of the Orocovis terrain runs through the Cordillera Central of the island. Most of the high peaks are in the southern region of the municipality within the limits of the municipality with Villalba and Coamo . The highest peak of the town is Cerro Mogote.  \\n\nThe rivers Toro Negro , Sana Muertos , Orocovis , Matrullas , and Bauta , and the creeks Doña Juana, Palmar and Cacaos are among the water bodies in the town. There are two lakes: El Guineo , a reservoir of the Toro Negro River, and the Matrullas Lake formed by the Bauta River. El Guineo is Puerto Rico\\'s highest lake.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Orocovis is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .   \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Orocovis: Ala de la Piedra, Alturas de Orocovis, Cacao, Sector Parcelas in Botijas 1, Botijas II, Comunidad Miraflores  and La Pica (Luis M. Alfaro) .  \\n\nEnergy consortium\nAn Energy Consortium was signed in late February, 2019 by Villalba , Orocovis, Morovis , Ciales and Barranquitas municipalities. The consortium is the first of its kind for the island. It is intended to have municipalities work together to safeguard and create resilient, and efficient energy networks, with backups for their communities.  \\n\nCulture\nOrocovis is sometimes called \" The Musical Capital of Puerto Rico \" because many major Puerto Rican performers were either born or raised in the town, particularly bandleader Bobby Valentín , folk singer Andrés Jiménez , merengue singer Manny Manuel , salsa legend William \"H. Christ\" Corchado, and the Colón-Zayas family of musicians, which includes Emma (singer, multi-instrumentalist) and Edwin (a cuatro player).\\n\nCelestino Avilés Meléndez (1925-2004), a santero from Orocovis, saved the dying art from his workshop. Santeros are folk artists who create wooden, religious statuettes called Santos .  The folk artists were dispersed around Puerto Rico and were few in number.  Avilés\\' initiative, in 1983, for santeros to meet continues to this day with the Encuentro Nacional de Santeros taking place in Orocovis, the third week in December annually. Also, Avilés\\' establishing the Museo Orocoveño Familia Avilés Inc. in 1982, a museum for santeros art, revived the culture and art of santeros and santos and by 2019, there were more than 300 santeros making santos in Puerto Rico.  \\n\n\"El Monstruo\" at Toro Verde Nature Adventure Park in Orocovis came in third for longest zip line in the world in 2018, at 2530 m (8,300 ft).  \\n\nOrocovis celebrates its patron saint festival in June. The Fiestas Patronales de San Juan Bautista is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.    \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Orocovis include:\\n\nEconomy\nCattle, coffee, fruits, tobacco, and wheat. A young business growing hydroponics lettuce was in negotiations to be a supplier for Walmart in 2019.  \\n\nSeveral small nutritional product industries.\\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2000 census, Orocovis has a population of 23,844 with a population density is 378.4 people per square mile (145.5/km 2 ). Although there was a decline in the population during the 1980s, it has steadily increased during the last decades.\\n\nStatistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 81.4% of Orocoveños have Spanish or White origin, 4.1% are black , 0.4% are Amerindian etc.\\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years. Jesús Colón Berlingeri (of the New Progressive Party ) has served as mayor since 1998.\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VI , which is represented by two senators. In 2012, Miguel Pereira Castillo and Angel M. Rodríguez were elected as district senators.  \\n\nEducation\nOrocovis has several public and private schools and public education is administered by the Puerto Rico Department of Education .\\n\nTransportation\nThere is no direct highway connection to Orocovis. Roads #137 and #155 lead from the north, while roads #138 and #155 lead from the south. Orocovis lies at about an hour and a half from San Juan , the capital of Puerto Rico.\\n\nThere are 17 bridges in Orocovis.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe Flag of Orocovis is formed by five vertical stripes: Two green stripes at the ends, representing the territories of Aibonito and Barranquitas ; and a blue one in the center representing the regional domain of the cacique Orocobix prior to the Spanish colonization. These stripes are divided by two narrower white stripes, representing the territories granted by Barranquitas and Morovis to form the municipality in 1825.  \\n\nOver the blue portion there\\'s an oval with a Sun . The Sun has seventeen rays that represent the different regions of the town. The Sun, being the center of the Solar System , represents Orocovis as the center of the island of Puerto Rico .  \\n\nThe oval is symbol of the letter \" O \", initial of the name of the town. In each quadrant appear representative elements of the town. In the left superior quadrant a Taíno Indian bust, symbol of the great \"Chief Orocobix\" and the Indian heritage of the town, silhouetted in gold on a silver-plated background. The Indian bust faces to the star or sun that appears in the superior right quadrant, which is in gold on a blue background and represents the territorial municipality with its seventeen rays or demarcations. In the inferior right quadrant, a plantain plant is observed representing the agriculture , silhouetted in gold on a silver-plated background. A bridge also silhouetted in gold on a blue background, above the river appears in the left inferior quadrant.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

Theologically , it is chiefly defined by regarding the Torah , both Written and Oral , as revealed by God to Moses on Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since.\\n\nOrthodox Judaism, therefore, advocates a strict observance of Jewish law, or halakha , which is supposed to be exclusively interpreted and determined according to traditional methods and it is supposed to be adhered to according to the continuum of precedents which have been received through the ages. It regards the entire halakhic system as a system of law which is ultimately grounded in immutable revelation, essentially beyond external influence. Key practices are observing the Sabbath , eating kosher , and Torah study . Key doctrines include a future Messiah who will restore Jewish practice by building the temple in Jerusalem and gathering all the Jews to Israel , belief in a future bodily resurrection of the dead , divine reward and punishment for the righteous and the sinners.\\n\nOrthodox Judaism encompasses a broad spectrum of religious practices, ranging from the insular Haredi communities to the more outwardly engaged Modern Orthodox groups. While all Orthodox Jews adhere to halakha, the interpretation and application of these laws vary, leading to different levels of interaction with the modern world. For example, Haredi communities emphasize even stricter adherence to tradition and often live in enclaves that limit exposure to secular society. In contrast, Modern Orthodox Jews balance observance with professional careers and education, and many advocate for active participation in broader society. The common thread uniting these groups is the belief that the Torah, both written and oral, is divine and immutable.  \\n\nWhile it adheres to traditional beliefs, the movement is a modern phenomenon. It arose as a result of the breakdown of the autonomous Jewish community since the 18th century, and it was greatly shaped by a conscious struggle against the pressures of secularization and the lure of rival alternatives. The strictly observant Orthodox are a definite minority among all Jews, but there are also numerous semi- and non-practicing individuals who affiliate or identify with Orthodoxy. It is the largest Jewish religious group, estimated to have over two million practicing adherents, and at least an equal number of nominal members.\\n\nDefinitions\nThe earliest known mention of the term Orthodox Jews was made in the Berlinische Monatsschrift in 1795. The word Orthodox was borrowed from the general German Enlightenment discourse, and used to denote those Jews who opposed Enlightenment. During the early and mid-19th century, with the advent of the progressive movements among German Jews, and especially early Reform Judaism , the title Orthodox became the epithet of traditionalists who espoused conservative positions on the issues raised by modernization. They themselves often disliked the name that was earlier adopted by eastern Christianity, preferring titles such as \"Torah-true\" ( gesetztreu ). They often declared they used it only as a convenience. German Orthodox leader Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch referred to \"the conviction commonly designated as Orthodox Judaism\"; in 1882, when Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer became convinced that the public understood that his philosophy and Liberal Judaism were radically different, he removed the word Orthodox from the name of his Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary . By the 1920s, the term had become common and accepted even in Eastern Europe.  \\n\nOrthodoxy perceives itself as the only authentic continuation of Judaism as it was until the crisis of modernity. Its progressive opponents often shared this view, regarding it as a remnant of the past and lending credit to their own rival ideology.  : 5-22 Thus, the term Orthodox is often used generically to refer to traditional (even if only in the sense that it is unrelated to modernist movement) synagogues, rites, and observances.\\n\nAcademic research noted that the formation of Orthodox ideology and organizations was itself influenced by modernity. This was brought about by the need to defend the very concept of tradition in a world where that was no longer self-evident. When secularization and the dismantlement of communal structures uprooted the old order of Jewish life, traditionalist elements united to form groups that had a specific self-understanding. This, and all that it entailed, constituted a notable change, for the Orthodox had to adapt to modern society no less than anyone else; they developed novel, sometimes radical, means of action and modes of thought. \"Orthodoxization\" was a contingent process, drawing from local circumstances and dependent on the threat sensed by its proponents: a sharply-delineated Orthodox identity appeared in Central Europe, in Germany and Hungary, by the 1860s; a less stark one emerged in Eastern Europe during the Interwar period . Among the Jews of the Muslim lands , similar processes on a large scale began only around the 1970s, after they immigrated to Israel. Orthodoxy is often described as extremely conservative, ossifying a once-dynamic tradition due to the fear of legitimizing change. While this was sometimes true, its defining feature was not forbidding change and \"freezing\" Jewish heritage, but rather the need to adapt to the segment of Judaism in a modern world inhospitable to traditional practice. Orthodoxy often involved much accommodation and leniency. In the mid-1980s, research on Orthodox Judaism became a scholarly discipline, examining how the need to confront modernity shaped and changed its beliefs, ideologies, social structure, and halakhic rulings, separating it from traditional Jewish society.  \\n\nHistory\nUntil the latter half of the 18th century, Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe were autonomous entities, with distinct privileges and obligations. They were led by the affluent wardens\\' class ( parnasim ), judicially subject to rabbinical courts , which governed most civil matters. The rabbinical class monopolized education and morals, much like the Christian clergy. Jewish Law was considered normative and enforced upon transgressors (common sinning was rebuked, but tolerated) invoking all communal sanctions: imprisonment, taxation, flogging, pillorying, and, especially, excommunication . Cultural, economic, and social exchange with non-Jewish society was limited and regulated.\\n\nThis state of affairs came to an end with the rise of the modern, centralized state, which appropriated all authority. The nobility, clergy, urban guilds, and all other corporate estates were gradually stripped of privileges, inadvertently creating a more equal and secularized society. The Jews were one of the groups affected: excommunication was banned, and rabbinic courts lost almost all their jurisdiction. The state, especially following the French Revolution , was more and more inclined to tolerate Jews as a religious sect, but not as an autonomous entity, and sought to reform and integrate them as \"useful subjects\". Jewish emancipation and equal rights were discussed. The Christian (and especially Protestant ) separation of \"religious\" and \"secular\" was applied to Jewish affairs, to which these concepts were alien. The rabbis were bemused when the state expected them to assume pastoral care, foregoing their principal judicial role. Of secondary importance, much less than the civil and legal transformations, were the ideas of Enlightenment that chafed at the authority of tradition and faith.\\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the weakened rabbinic establishment was facing a new kind of transgressor: they could not be classified as tolerable sinners overcome by their urges ( khote le-te\\'avon ), or as schismatics like the Sabbateans or Frankists , against whom sanctions were levied. Their attitudes did not fit the criteria set when faith was a normative and self-evident part of worldly life, but rested on the realities of the new, secularized age. The wardens\\' class, which wielded most power within the communities, was rapidly acculturating and often sought to oblige the state\\'s agenda. \\n\nRabbi Elazar Fleckeles , who returned to Prague from the countryside in 1783, recalled that he first faced there \"new vices\" of principled irreverence towards tradition, rather than \"old vices\" such as gossip or fornication. In Hamburg , Rabbi Raphael Cohen attempted to reinforce traditional norms. Cohen ordered the men in his community to grow a beard, forbade holding hands with one\\'s wife in public, and decried women who wore wigs, instead of visible headgear , to cover their hair; Cohen taxed and otherwise persecuted members of the priestly caste who left the city to marry divorcees, men who appealed to state courts , those who ate food cooked by Gentiles , and other transgressors. Hamburg\\'s Jews repeatedly appealed to the civil authorities, which eventually justified Cohen. However, the unprecedented meddling in his jurisdiction profoundly shocked him and dealt a blow to the prestige of the rabbinate.\\n\n\\nAn ideological challenge to rabbinic authority, in contrast to prosaic secularization, appeared in the form of the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) movement which came to the fore in 1782. Hartwig Wessely , Moses Mendelssohn , and other maskilim called for a reform of Jewish education , abolition of coercion in matters of conscience , and other modernizing measures. They bypassed rabbinic approval and set themselves, at least implicitly, as a rival intellectual elite. A bitter struggle ensued. Reacting to Mendelssohn\\'s assertion that freedom of conscience must replace communal censure, Rabbi Cohen of Hamburg commented:\nThe very foundation of the Law and commandments rests on coercion, enabling to force obedience and punish the transgressor. Denying this fact is akin to denying the sun at noon. \nHowever, maskilic \\'-rabbinic rivalry ended in most of Central Europe, as governments imposed modernization upon their Jewish subjects. Schools replaced traditional cheders , and standard German began to supplant Yiddish . Differences between the establishment and the Enlightened became irrelevant, and the former often embraced the views of the latter (now antiquated, as more aggressive modes of acculturation replaced the Haskalahs program). In 1810, when philanthropist Israel Jacobson opened what was later identified as the first Reform synagogue  in Seesen , with modernized rituals, he encountered little protest.\\n\nThe founding of the Hamburg Temple in 1818 mobilized the conservative elements. The organizers of the synagogue wished to appeal to acculturated Jews with a modernized ritual. They openly defied not just the local rabbinic court that ordered them to desist, but published learned tracts that castigated the entire rabbinical elite as hypocritical and obscurant . The moral threat they posed to rabbinic authority, as well as halakhic issues such as having a gentile play an organ on the Sabbath, were combined with theological issues. The Temple\\'s revised prayer book omitted or rephrased petitions for the coming of the Messiah and renewal of sacrifices ( post factum , it was considered to be the first Reform liturgy). More than anything else, this doctrinal breach alarmed the traditionalists. Dozens of rabbis from across Europe united in support of the Hamburg rabbinic court, banning the major practices enacted there and offering halakhic grounds for forbidding any changes. Most historians concur that the 1818-1821 Hamburg Temple dispute , with its concerted backlash against Reform and the emergence of a self-aware conservative ideology, marks the beginning of Orthodox Judaism.\\n\nThe leader and organizer of the Orthodox camp during the dispute, and the most influential figure in early Orthodoxy, was Rabbi Moses Sofer of Pressburg , Hungary . Historian Jacob Katz regarded him as the first to grasp the realities of the modern age. Sofer understood that what remained of his political clout would soon disappear, and that he had largely lost the ability to enforce observance; as Katz wrote, \"obedience to halakha became dependent on recognizing its validity, and this very validity was challenged by those who did not obey\". He was deeply troubled by reports from his native Frankfurt and the arrival from the west of dismissed rabbis, ejected by progressive wardens, or pious families, fearing for the education of their children. These émigrés often became ardent followers.\\n\nSofer\\'s response to the crisis of traditional Jewish society was unremitting conservatism, canonizing every detail of prevalent norms in the observant community lest any compromise legitimize the progressives\\' claim that the law was fluid or redundant. He was unwilling to trade halakhic opinions for those he considered to be pretending to honor the rules of rabbinic discourse, while intending to undermine them. Sofer regarded traditional customs as equivalent to vows; he warned in 1793 that even the \"custom of ignoramuses\" (one known to be rooted solely in a mistake of the common masses) was to be meticulously observed and revered. Sofer was frank and vehement about his stance, stating during the Hamburg dispute that prayers in the vernacular were not problematic per se , but he forbade them because they constituted an innovation. He succinctly expressed his attitude in wordplay he borrowed from the Talmud: \"The new ( Chadash , originally meaning new grain) is forbidden by the Torah anywhere.\" Regarding the new, ideologically-driven sinners, Sofer commented in 1818 that they should have been anathemized and banished from the People of Israel like earlier heretical sects.\\n\nUnlike most, if not all, rabbis in Central Europe, who had little choice but to compromise, Sofer enjoyed unique circumstances. He, too, had to tread carefully during the 1810s, tolerating a modernized synagogue in Pressburg and other innovations, and his yeshiva was nearly closed by warden Wolf Breisach. But in 1822, three poor (and therefore traditional) community members, whose deceased apostate brother bequeathed them a large fortune, rose to the wardens\\' board. Breisach died soon after, and the Pressburg community became dominated by the conservatives. Sofer also possessed a strong base in the form of his yeshiva , the world\\'s largest at the time, with hundreds of students. And crucially, the large and privileged Hungarian nobility blocked most imperial reforms in the backward country, including those relevant to the Jews. Hungarian Jewry retained its pre-modern character well into the 19th century, allowing Sofer\\'s disciples to establish a score of new yeshivas , at a time when these institutions were rapidly closing in the west, and a strong rabbinate to appoint them. A generation later, a self-aware Orthodoxy was well entrenched in the country. Hungarian Jewry gave rise both to Orthodoxy in general, in the sense of a comprehensive response to modernity, and specifically to the traditionalist, militant ultra-Orthodoxy .  \\n\nThe 1818-1821 controversy also elicited a different response, which first arose in its very epicenter. Severe protests did not affect Temple congregants, eventually leading the wardens of Hamburg\\'s Jewish community to a comprehensive compromise for the sake of unity. They replaced the elderly, traditional Chief Dayan Baruch Oser with Isaac Bernays . The latter was a university graduate, clean-shaven, and modern, who could appeal to the acculturated and the young. Bernays signified a new era, and historians marked him as the first modern rabbi, fitting the demands of emancipation: his contract forbade him to tax, punish, or coerce, and he lacked political or judiciary power. He was forbidden from interfering in the Temple\\'s conduct. Conservative in the principal issues of faith, in aesthetic, cultural, and civil matters, Bernays was a reformer and the Temple leaders. He introduced secular studies for children, wore a cassock like a Protestant clergyman, and delivered vernacular sermons. He forbade the spontaneous, informal character of synagogue conduct typical of Ashkenazi tradition, and ordered prayers to be somber and dignified. Bernays\\' style re-unified the Hamburg community by accommodating their aesthetic demands (but not theological ones, raised by only a learned few).  \\n\nThe combination of religious conservatism and modernity in everything else was emulated elsewhere, earning the label \" Neo-Orthodoxy \". Bernays and his like-minded followers, such as Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger , fully accepted the platform of the moderate Haskalah , taking away its progressive edge. While old-style traditional life continued in Germany until the 1840s, secularization and acculturation turned Neo-Orthodoxy into the strict right-wing of German Jewry. It was fully articulated by Bernays\\' mid-century disciples Samson Raphael Hirsch and Azriel Hildesheimer . Hirsch, a Hamburg native who was ten during the Temple dispute, combined Orthodox dogmatism and militancy against rival interpretations of Judaism, granting leniency on many cultural issues and embraced German culture. The novel mixture termed Neo-Orthodoxy spread.\\n\nWhile insisting on strict observance, the movement both tolerated and advocated modernization: Traditionally rare formal religious education for girls was introduced; modesty and gender separation were relaxed to match German society; men went clean-shaven and dressed like Gentiles; and exclusive Torah study virtually disappeared. Basic religious studies incorporating German Bildung provided children with practical halakhic knowledge for thriving in modern society. Ritual was reformed to match prevalent aesthetic conceptions, much like non-Orthodox synagogues though without the ideological undertone, and the liturgy was often abbreviated. Neo-Orthodoxy mostly did not attempt to reconcile its conduct and halakhic or moral norms. Instead it adopted compartmentalization, de facto limiting Judaism to the private and religious spheres, while otherwise yielding to outer society.   While conservative Rabbis in Hungary still thought in terms of the now-lost communal autonomy, the Neo-Orthodox turned Judaism from an all-encompassing practice into a private religious conviction.\\n\nIn the late 1830s, modernist pressures in Germany shifted from the secularization debate, moving into the \"purely religious\" sphere of theology and liturgy. A new generation of university-trained rabbis (many German states required communal rabbis to possess such education) sought to reconcile Judaism with the historical-critical study of scripture and the dominant philosophies of the day, especially Kant and Hegel . Influenced by the critical \" Science of Judaism \" ( Wissenschaft des Judentums ) pioneered by Leopold Zunz , and often in emulation of the Liberal Protestant milieu, they reexamined and undermined beliefs held as sacred in traditional circles, especially the notion of an unbroken chain from Sinai to the Sages . The more radical among the Wissenschaft rabbis, unwilling to limit critical analysis or its practical application, coalesced around Rabbi Abraham Geiger to establish Reform Judaism . Between 1844 and 1846, Geiger organized three rabbinical synods in Braunschweig , Frankfurt and Breslau , to determine how to refashion Judaism for present times.\\n\nThe Reform conferences were met with uproar by the Orthodox. Warden Hirsch Lehren of Amsterdam and Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger of Altona both organized anti-Reform manifestos, denouncing the new initiatives, signed by scores of rabbis from Europe and the Middle East. The tone of the signatories varied considerably along geographic lines: letters from traditional societies in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire implored local leaders to petition the authorities and have them ban the movement. Signers from Central and Western Europe used terms commensurate with the liberal age. All were implored by the petitioners to be brief and accessible; complex halakhic arguments, intended to convince the rabbinic elite in past generations, were replaced by an appeal to the secularized masses.\\n\nThe struggle with Wissenschaft criticism shaped the Orthodox. For centuries, Ashkenazi rabbinic authorities espoused Nahmanides \\' position that the Talmudic exegesis , which derived laws from the Torah \\'s text by employing hermeneutics , was binding d\\'Oraita . Geiger and others presented exegesis as an arbitrary, illogical process, and consequently defenders of tradition embraced Maimonides \\' claim that the Sages merely buttressed already received laws with biblical citations, rather than actually deriving them. \\n\nJay Harris commented, \"An insulated orthodox, or, rather, traditional rabbinate, feeling no pressing need to defend the validity of the Oral Law, could confidently appropriate the vision of most medieval rabbinic scholars; a defensive German Orthodoxy, by contrast, could not. ... Thus began a shift in understanding that led Orthodox rabbis and historians in the modern period to insist that the entire Oral Law was revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.\" 19th-Century Orthodox commentaries, like those authored by Malbim , attempted to amplify the notion that the Oral and Written Law were intertwined and inseparable.  \\n\nWissenschaft posed a greater challenge to the modernized neo-Orthodox than to the traditionalist. Hirsch and Hildesheimer divided on the matter, anticipating modernist Orthodox attitudes to the historical-critical method. Hirsch argued that analyzing minutiae of tradition as products of their historical context was akin to denying its divine origin and timeless relevance. Hildesheimer consented to research under limits, subjugating it to the predetermined sanctity of the subject matter and accepting its results only when they accorded with the latter. More importantly, while he was content to engage academically, he opposed its practical application in religious questions, requiring traditional methods to be used. Hildesheimer\\'s approach was emulated by his disciple Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann , a scholar and apologetic.  His polemic against the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis formed the classical Orthodox response to Higher Criticism. Hoffman declared that for him, the unity of the Pentateuch was a given, regardless of research. Hirsch often lambasted Hoffman for contextualizing rabbinic literature.  \\n\nAll of them stressed the importance of dogmatic adherence to Torah min ha-Shamayim , which led them to conflict with Rabbi Zecharias Frankel , Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau . Unlike the Reform camp, Frankel insisted on strict observance and displayed great reverence towards tradition. But though appreciated by conservatives, his practice of Wissenschaft left him suspect to Hirsch and Hildesheimer. They demanded again and again that he state his beliefs concerning the nature of revelation. In 1859, Frankel published a critical study of the Mishnah , and added that all commandments classified as \" Law given to Moses at Sinai \" were merely customs (he broadened Asher ben Jehiel \\'s opinion). Hirsch and Hildesheimer seized the opportunity and launched a public campaign against him, accusing him of heresy. Concerned that public opinion regarded both neo-Orthodoxy and Frankel\\'s \"Positive-Historical School\" centered at Breslau as similarly observant and traditionalist, the two stressed that the difference was dogmatic and not halakhic . They managed to tarnish Frankel\\'s reputation in the traditional camp and delegitimized him for many. The Positive-Historical School is regarded by Conservative Judaism as an intellectual forerunner.   While Hildesheimer distinguished Frankel\\'s observant disciples from Reform proponents, he wrote in his diary: how meager is the principal difference between the Breslau School, who don silk gloves at their work, and Geiger who wields a sledgehammer .  \\n\nDuring the 1840s in Germany, as traditionalists became a clear minority, some Orthodox rabbis, such as Salomo Eger of Posen , urged the adoption of Moses Sofer \\'s position and to anathemize the principally nonobservant. Eating, worshipping or marrying with them were to be banned. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger , whose journal Treue Zionsw\\xc3 4chter was the first regular Orthodox newspaper, signifying the coalescence of a distinct Orthodox millieu, rejected their call. Ettlinger, and German neo-Orthodoxy in his wake, chose to regard the modern secularized Jew as a transgressor rather than a schismatic. He adopted Maimonides\\' interpretation of the Talmudic concept tinok shenishba (captured infant), a Jew by birth who was not raised as such and therefore could be absolved for not practicing, and greatly expanded it to serve the Orthodox need to tolerate the nonobservant majority: Many of their own congregants were far removed from strict practice. For example, he allowed congregants to drink wine poured by Sabbath desecrators, and to ignore other halakhic sanctions. Yet German neo-Orthodoxy could not legitimize nonobservance, and adopted a hierarchical approach, softer than traditional sanctions, but no less intent on differentiating sinners and righteous. Reform rabbis or lay leaders, considered ideological opponents, were castigated, while the common mass was to be carefully handled.  \\n\nSome German neo-Orthodox believed that while doomed to minority status in their native country, their ideology could successfully confront modernity and unify Judaism in more traditional communities to the east. In 1847, Hirsch was elected Chief Rabbi of Moravia , where old rabbinic culture and yeshiva s were still extant. His expectations were dashed as traditionalist rabbis scorned him for his European manners and lack of Talmudic acumen. They became enraged by his attempts to reform synagogues and to establish a rabbinical seminary including secular studies. The progressives viewed him as too conservative. After four years of constant strife, he lost faith in the possibility of reuniting the Jewish public. In 1851, a group in Frankfurt am Main that opposed the Reform character of the Jewish community turned to Hirsch. He led them for the remainder of his life, finding Frankfurt a hospitable site for his unique ideology, which amalgamated acculturation, dogmatic theology, thorough observance, and strict secession from the non-Orthodox.\\n\nThat year, Hildesheimer visited Hungary. Confounded by urbanization and acculturation - and the rise of Neology , a nonobservant laity served by rabbis who mostly favoured the Positive-Historical approach - the elderly local rabbis at first welcomed Hildesheimer. He opened a modern school in Eisenstadt that included secular studies in the curriculum. Traditionalists such as Moshe Schick and Yehudah Aszód sent their sons to study there. Samuel Benjamin Sofer , the heir of late Hatam Sofer, considered appointing Hildesheimer as his assistant-rabbi in Pressburg and instituting secular studies in the city\\'s great yeshiva . The rabbi of Eisenstadt believed that only a full-fledged modern rabbinical seminary could fulfill his neo-Orthodox agenda. In the 1850s and 1860s, however, a radical reactionary Orthodox party coalesced in the northeastern regions of Hungary . Led by Rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein , his son-in-law Akiva Yosef Schlesinger and decisor Chaim Sofer , the \"zealots\" were shocked by the demise of the traditional world into which they had been born. Like Moses Sofer a generation before them, these Orthodox émigrés moved east, to a pre-modern environment that they were determined to safeguard. Lichtenstein ruled out any compromise with modernity, insisting on maintaining Yiddish and traditional dress. They considered the Neologs as already beyond the pale of Jewishness, and were more concerned with neo-Orthodoxy, which they regarded as a thinly-veiled gateway for a similar fate. Chaim Sofer summarized their view of Hildesheimer: \"The wicked Hildesheimer is the horse and chariot of the Evil Inclination ... All the heretics in the last century did not seek to undermine the Law and the Faith as he does.\"\\n\nIn their struggle against acculturation, the Hungarian ultra-Orthodox struggled to provide strong halakhic arguments. Michael Silber wrote: \"These issues, even most of the religious reforms, fell into gray areas not easily treated within Halakha. It was often too flexible or ambiguous, at times silent, or worse yet, embarrassingly lenient.\" Schlesinger was forced to venture outside of normative law, into mystical writings and other fringe sources, to buttress his ideology. Most Hungarian Orthodox rabbis, while sympathetic to the \"zealots\"\\' cause, dismissed their legal arguments. In 1865, the ultra-Orthodox convened in Nagymihály and issued a ban on various synagogue reforms, intended not against the Neologs but against developments in the Orthodox camp, especially after Samuel Sofer violated his father\\'s expressed ban and instituted vernacular sermons in Pressburg. Schick, the country\\'s most prominent decisor, and other leading rabbis refused to sign, though they did not publicly oppose the decree. On the other end of the spectrum, Hildesheimer\\'s planned seminary was too radical for the same mainstream rabbis, and he became marginalized and isolated by 1864.  \\n\nThe internal Orthodox division was complicated by growing tension with the Neologs. In 1869, the Hungarian government convened a General Jewish Congress that was aimed at creating a national representative body. Fearing Neolog domination, the Orthodox seceded from the Congress and appealed to Parliament in the name of religious freedom. This demonstrated the internalization of the new circumstances: Twenty years before, in 1851, Orthodox leader Meir Eisenstaedter petitioned the authorities to restore the old coercive powers of the communities. In 1871 the government recognized a separate Orthodox national committee. Communities that refused to join either side, labeled \"Status Quo\", were subject to Orthodox condemnation even when impeccably conservative. However, the Orthodox tolerated nonobservant Jews as long as they affiliated with the national committee: Adam Ferziger claimed that membership and loyalty, rather than beliefs and ritual behavior, emerged as the definitive manifestation of Jewish identity. The Hungarian schism was the most radical internal separation among the Jews of Europe. Hildesheimer returned to Germany soon after, disillusioned though not as pessimistic as Hirsch. He was appointed rabbi of the Orthodox sub-community in Berlin (which had separate religious institutions but was not formally independent of the Liberal majority), where he finally established his seminary.  \\n\nIn 1877, a law enabling Jews to secede from their communities without baptism was passed in Germany. It was a stark example that Judaism was now confessional, not corporate. Hirsch withdrew his congregation from the Frankfurt community, and decreed that all Orthodox should do the same. However, unlike the heterogeneous congregations of Hungary, which often consisted of recent immigrants, Frankfurt and most German communities were close-knit. The majority of Hirsch\\'s congregants enlisted Rabbi Seligman Baer Bamberger , who was older and more conservative. Bamberger was concerned with the principal of unity among the People Israel and dismissive of Hirsch, whom he regarded as unlearned and overly assimilated. He decreed that since the mother community was willing to finance Orthodox services and allow them religious freedom, secession was unwarranted. Eventually, less than 80 families from Hirsch\\'s 300-strong congregation followed their rabbi. The vast majority of the 15%-20% of German Jews affiliated with Orthodox institutions cared little for the polemics. They did not secede over reasons of finance and familial relations. Only a handful of Secessionist, Austrittorthodox , communities were established in the Reich; almost everyone remained Communal Orthodox, Gemeindeortodox , within Liberal mother congregations. The Communal Orthodox argued that their approach was true to Jewish unity and decisive in maintaining public standards of observance and traditional education in Liberal communities. The Secessionists viewed them as hypocritical middle-of-the-roaders.  \\n\nThe conflicts in Hungary and Germany, and the emergence of distinctly Orthodox communities and ideologies, were the exception rather than the rule in Central and Western Europe. France, Britain, Bohemia, Austria and other countries saw both a virtual disappearance of traditional Jewish life, and no serious interest in bridging Judaism and modernity. The official rabbinate remained technically traditional, in the default sense of not introducing ideological change.  The organ - a symbol of Reform in Germany since 1818, so much that Hildesheimer seminarians had to sign a declaration that they would never serve in a synagogue that introduced one - was accepted with little qualm by the French Consistoire in 1856, as part of a series of synagogue regulations passed by Chief Rabbi Salomon Ulmann . Even Rabbi Solomon Klein of Colmar , the leader of Alsatian conservatives who partook in the castigation of Zecharias Frankel, allowed the instrument in his community.  In England, Rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler \\'s United Synagogue shared a similar approach: It was vehemently conservative in principle and combated ideological reformers , yet served a nonobservant public - as Todd Endelman noted, \"While respectful of tradition, most English-born Jews were not orthodox in terms of personal practice. Nonetheless they were content to remain within an orthodox congregational framework\" - and introduced considerable synagogue reforms.  \\n\nThe slow pace of modernization in Russia, Congress Poland and Romanian principalities delayed the crisis of traditional society for decades. , Harsh discrimination and active persecution of Jews continued there until 1917. Old-style education in the heder and yeshiva remained the norm, retaining Hebrew as the language of the elite and Yiddish as the vernacular. The defining fault-line of Eastern European Jews was between the Hasidim and the Misnagdic reaction against them. Reform attempts by the Czar \\'s government all had little influence. School modernization under Max Lilienthal , the growth of rabbinical seminaries and the mandating to appoint clerks known as \"official rabbis\" all had little impact. Communal autonomy and the rabbinic courts\\' jurisdiction were abolished in 1844, but economic and social seclusion remained, ensuring the de facto authority of Jewish institutions and traditions. In 1880, only 21,308 Jewish pupils attended government schools, out of some 5 million Jews; In 1897, 97% of the 5.2 million Jews in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland spoke Yiddish their mother tongue, and only 26% were literate in Russian. Though the Eastern European Haskalah challenged the traditional establishment, it flourished from the 1820s until the 1890s. Unlike its western counterpart, it thrived despite ongoing acculturation. The leading rabbis maintained the concept of communal unity: in 1882, when an Orthodox party in Galicia appealed for the right of secession, the Netziv and other Russian rabbis forbade it for contradicting the idea of Israel\\'s unity.  \\n\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, moderate maskilic rabbis like Yitzchak Yaacov Reines and Yechiel Michel Pines called for inclusion of secular studies in the heder s and yeshiva s, anticipating a communal disintegration as in the west. Instead they proposed a careful modernization, based on a consensus on the adaptation of halakha . Their initiative was thwarted by a combination of radical, secularist maskilim and leading conservative rabbis. This was highlighted during the battle that erupted after Moshe Leib Lilienblum \\'s 1868 call for a reconsideration of Talmudic strictures. Reines, Pines and their associates gradually formed the nucleus of Religious Zionism , while their conservative opponents adopted the epithet Haredim (generic term for the observant and the pious).  \\n\nJewish nationalism, particularly Zionism , with its nonobservant if not staunchly secular partisans, was the key question facing Eastern European traditionalists, although it was tangled with modernization. Salmon claimed that the future Zionists were: supportive of a national agenda; motivated by criticism of Jewish society; supportive of modernity; tolerant of nonobservance; and approving of traditional faith and practice. Their proto- Haredi opponents sharply rejected all he former positions and espoused staunch conservatism, which idealized existing norms. Any illusion that differences could be blanded and a united observant pro-Zionist front would be formed, were dashed between 1897 and 1899, as both the Eastern European nationalist intellectuals and Theodor Herzl himself revealed an uncompromising secularist agenda, forcing traditionalist leaders to pick sides. In 1900, the anti-Zionist pamphlet Or la-Yesharim , endorsed by many Russian and Polish rabbis, largely demarcated the lines between the proto- Haredi majority and the Mizrahi minority, and terminated dialogue; in 1911, when the 10th World Zionist Congress voted in favour of propagating non-religious cultural work and education, a large segment of the Mizrahi seceded and joined the anti-Zionists.  \\n\nIn 1907, Eastern European proto- Haredi elements formed the Knesseth Israel party, a modern framework created in recognition of the deficiencies of existing institutions. It dissipated within a year. German Neo-Orthodoxy, in the meantime, developed a keen interest in the traditional Jewish masses of Russia and Poland; if at the past they were considered primitive, a disillusionment with emancipation and enlightenment made many young assimilated German Orthodox youth embark on journeys to East European yeshivot , in search of authenticity. The German secessionists already possessed a platform of their own, the Freie Vereinigung für die Interessen des Orthodoxen Judentums , founded by Samson Raphael Hirsch in 1885. In 1912, two German FVIOJ leaders, Isaac Breuer and Jacob Rosenheim , managed to organize a meeting of 300 seceding Mizrahi, proto- Haredi and secessionist Neo-Orthodox delegate in Katowice , creating the Agudath Israel party. While the Germans were a tiny minority in comparison to the Eastern Europeans, their modern education made them a prominent elite in the new organization, which strove to provide a comprehensive response to world Jewry\\'s challenges in a strictly observant spirit. The Agudah immediately formed its Council of Torah Sages as supreme rabbinic leadership body. Many ultra-traditionalist elements in Eastern Europe, like the Belz and Lubavitch Hasidim, refused to join, viewing the movement as a dangerous innovation; and the organized Orthodox in Hungary rejected it as well, especially after it did not affirm a commitment to communal secession in 1923.\\n\nIn the Interwar period , sweeping secularization and acculturation deracinated old Jewish society in Eastern Europe. The October Revolution granted civil equality and imposed anti-religious persecutions, radically transforming Russian Jewry within a decade; the lifting of formal discrimination also strongly affected the Jews of independent Poland , Lithuania and other states. In the 1930s, it was estimated that no more than 20%-33% of Poland\\'s Jews, the last stronghold of traditionalism where many were still living in rural and culturally-secluded communities, could be considered strictly observant.  Only upon having become an embattled (though still quite large) minority, did the local traditionalists complete their transformation into Orthodox, albeit never as starkly as in Hungary or Germany. Eastern European Orthodoxy, whether Agudah or Mizrahi, always preferred cultural and educational independence to communal secession, and maintained strong ties and self-identification with the general Jewish public.  Within its ranks, the 150-years-long struggle between Hasidim and Misnagdim was largely subsided; the latter were even dubbed henceforth as \"Litvaks\", as the anti-Hasidic component in their identity was marginalized. In the interwar period, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan emerged as the popular leader of the Eastern European Orthodox, particularly the Agudah-leaning.\\n\nAmerican Jewry of the 19th century was small and lacked traditional institutions or strong rabbinic presence due to its immigrant-based nature. This informality allow religious innovation to flourish. Voluntary congregations were the norm. Separation of church and state and dynamic religiosity along the Protestant model shaped synagogue life. In the mid-19th century, Reform Judaism spread rapidly, made popular by formally abandoning traditions that few upheld. The United States was labeled the Treife Medina , or \"Profane Country\", in Yiddish .  \\n\nIsaac Leeser was an ultra-traditionalist in the American context, although his lack of a rabbinic ordination and limited knowledge would have marked him as a heretic by European standards [ citation needed ] . In 1845 he introduced the words \"Orthodox\" and \"Orthodoxy\" into the American Jewish discourse, explicitly to oppose Reform.  Leeser was a staunch proponent of Zecharias Frankel , whom he considered the \"leader of the Orthodox party\". at a time when Positive-Historical and Orthodox positions were hardly distinguishable. In 1861, Leeser defended Frankel in a polemic instigated by Hirsch. Lesser became a rallying point for conservative elements, concerned mainly with public standards of observance in critical fields such as marriage.  \\n\nA broad non-Reform, relatively traditional camp slowly coalesced as the minority within American Jewry, serving the nonobservant. Their synagogues liberalized their approach: omission of piyyutim from the liturgy; English-language sermons; secular education for the clergy;  and many did not partition men and women.  In 1885, the antinomian Pittsburgh Platform moved conservative religious leaders to found the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS). Orthodoxy never became consistent and was mainly motivated by a rejection of Reform. They variously termed their ideology as \"Enlightened Orthodoxy\" or \" Conservative Judaism \". The latter gradually became the preferred term.\\n\nStrictly traditionalist Eastern European immigrants formed the Union of Orthodox Rabbis (UOR) in 1902, in direct opposition to the Americanized OU and JTS. The UOR frowned upon English-language sermons, secular education and any acculturation. In 1897, an old-style yeshiva , Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), was founded in New York. Its students rebelled in 1908, demanding rabbinic training more like that of their JTS peers. In 1915, RIETS was reorganized as a Modern Orthodox institution, and a merger with the JTS was discussed.  : 188-193 In 1923, the Rabbinical Council of America was established as the OU\\'s clerical association.\\nBetween the ultra-Orthodox and Conservatives, Modern Orthodoxy emerged as a distinct movement. Its postwar leader, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik , left Agudas Israel to adopt a positive, if reserved, attitude toward Western culture. As dean of RIETS and honorary chair of RCA\\'s halakha committee, Soloveitchik shaped Modern Orthodoxy for decades.  RCA stressed the divinely revealed status of the Torah and a strict observance of halakha , separating it from Conservative ideology. Physically separate seating (symbolized by gender partitions ) became the distinguishing mark of Orthodox/Conservative affiliation in the 1950s, and as pushed by the RCA.  However, many Modern Orthodox followers were barely observant, and many synagogues did not use a gender partition. As late as 1997, seven OU congregations lacked a partition.  By 2005, that number went down to one,  and ceased to exist when that synagogue resigned from the OU in 2015 after understanding that the OU was planning to expel it.  \\n\nIn the postwar era, the vague traditional coalition came to a definite end. During and after the Holocaust , a new wave of strictly observant refugees arrived from Eastern and Central Europe. They typically regarded the UOR as overly Americanized. Typical of these was Rabbi Aaron Kotler , who established Lakewood Yeshiva in New Jersey in 1943. Alarmed by the American innovations, Kotler turned his institution into an enclave, around which a community slowly evolved. It was unlike his prewar yeshiva at Kletsk , Poland , whose students mingled with the rest of the population. Lakewood pioneered the homogeneous, voluntary and enclavist model of postwar Haredi communities, which were independent entities developing their own subculture.  The new arrivals soon dominated the traditionalist wing of American Jewry, forcing locals to adopt their views. The younger generation in the JTS and the Rabbinical Assembly concurrently demanded greater clarity, theological unambiguity and halakhic independence from the Orthodox veto on serious innovations. In 1935, for example, the RA shelved its proposal for a solution to the agunah predicament. \"Conservative Judaism\" was adopted as an exclusive label by most JTS graduates and RA members, became a distinct movement. In 1950, the Conservatives signaled their break with Orthodoxy by acceptance of a far-reaching legal decision, which allowed one to drive to the synagogue and to use electricity on Sabbath.  \\n\nTheology\nJudaism never formulated a conclusive credo ; whether it reflects a dogma remains controversial. Some researchers argued that the importance of daily practice and adherence to halakha (Jewish law) mooted theoretical issues. Others dismissed this view entirely, citing ancient rabbinic debates that castigated various heresies with little reference to observance. However, even without a uniform doctrine, Orthodox Judaism is basically united in its core beliefs. Disavowing them is a major blasphemy . [ citation needed ] .\\n\nSeveral medieval authorities attempted to codify these beliefs, including Saadia Gaon and Joseph Albo . Each composed a creed, although the 13 principles expounded by Maimonides in his 1160s Commentary on the Mishna , remained the most widely accepted. Various points were contested by many of Maimonides\\' contemporaries and later sages, such as the exact formulation and the status of disbelievers (either misinformed or expelled heretics). Similarly, Albo listed only three fundamentals, and did not regard the Messiah as a key tenet. Many who objected argued that the entire corpus of the Torah and the sayings of ancient sages were of canonical stature, rather than a few selected points. In later centuries, the 13 Principles became considered universally binding and cardinal by Orthodox authorities.  \\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, two systems of thought competed for primacy. The rationalist-philosophic school endeavored to present all commandments as serving higher moral and ethical purposes, while the mystical tradition, exemplified in Kabbalah , assigned each rite with a role in hidden dimensions of reality. Sheer obedience, derived from faithfulness to one\\'s community and ancestry, was believed sufficient for the common people, while the educated chose one of the two schools. In the modern era, the prestige of both declined, and \"naive faith\" became popular. At a time when contemplation in matters of belief was associated with secularization, luminaries such as Yisrael Meir Kagan stressed the importance of simple, unsophisticated commitment to the precepts passed down from the Beatified Sages. [ clarification needed ] This became standard in the ultra-Orthodox world.  \\n\nJudaism adheres to monotheism , the belief in one God. The basic tenets of Orthodoxy, drawn from ancient sources like the Talmud and later sages, chiefly include the attributes of God in Judaism : one and indivisible, preceding all creation, which God alone brought into being, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, absolutely incorporeal, and beyond human reason. This basis is evoked in many foundational texts, and is repeated often in daily prayers, such as in Judaism\\'s creed-like Shema Yisrael : \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.\"\\n\nMaimonides delineated this understanding of a personal God in his opening six articles. The six concern God\\'s status as the sole creator, his oneness, his impalpability, that he is first and last, that God alone, and no other being, may be worshipped, and that he is omniscient. The supremacy of the God of Israel is even applied to non-Jews. According to most rabbinic opinions, non-Jews are banned from the worship of other deities. However, they are allowed to \" associate \" lower divine beings with their faith in God (mostly to allow contact with Christians , accepting that they were not idolaters with whom business dealings and the like are forbidden.)\\n\nThe utter imperceptibility of God, considered as beyond human reason and only reachable through what he chooses to reveal, was emphasized among others in the ancient ban on making any image of him . Maimonides and virtually all sages in his time and thereafter stressed that the creator is incorporeal, lacking \"any semblance of a body\". While incorporeality has almost been taken for granted since the Middle Ages, Maimonides and his contemporaries reported that anthropomorphic conceptions of God were quite common in their time.\\n\nThe medieval tension between God\\'s transcendence and equanimity , and his contact and interest in his creation, found its most popular resolution in the Kabbalah . Kabbalists asserted that while God himself is beyond the universe, he progressively unfolds into the created realm via a series of emanations, or sefirot , each a refraction of the perfect godhead. While widely received, this system proved contentious and some authorities lambasted it as a threat to God\\'s unity.  In modern times it is upheld, at least tacitly, in many traditionalist Orthodox circles, while Modern Orthodoxy mostly simply ignores it.\\n\nThe defining doctrine of Orthodox Judaism is the belief that God revealed the Torah (\"Teaching\" or \"Law\") to Moses on Mount Sinai, both the written scripture of the Torah and the Oral Torah explicating it, and that sages promulgated it faithfully from Sinai in an unbroken chain. One of the foundational texts of rabbinic literature is the list opening the Pirkei Avot , enumerating the sages, from Moses through Joshua , the Seventy Elders , and Prophets , and then onward until Hillel the Elder and Shammai . This core belief is referred to in classical sources as \"The Law/Teaching is from the Heavens\" ( Torah min HaShamayim ).\\n\nOrthodoxy holds that the body of revelation is total and complete. Its interpretation and application under new circumstances, required of every generation\\'s scholars, is an act of inferring and elaborating, not of innovation or addition. One clause in the Jerusalem Talmud asserts that anything that a veteran disciple shall teach was given at Sinai: a story in the Babylonian Talmud claims that Moses was taken aback upon seeing the immensely intricate deduction of future Rabbi Akiva in a vision, until Akiva proclaimed that Moses had received everything he was teaching. The Written and Oral Torah are held to be intertwined and mutually reliant. The latter is a source of many divine commandments, and the text of the Pentateuch is seen as incomprehensible. God\\'s will may be surmised only by appealing to the Oral Torah, which revealed the text\\'s allegorical, anagogical , or tropological meaning, rather than by a literal reading.\\n\nLacunae in received tradition or disagreements between early sages are attributed to disruptions, especially persecutions such that \"the Torah was forgotten in Israel.\" According to rabbinic lore, these eventually compelled the legists to write down the Oral Law in the Mishna and Talmud . The wholeness of the original divine message and the reliability of those who transmitted it are axiomatic. One of the primary intellectual exercises of Torah scholars is to locate discrepancies between Talmudic or other passages and then demonstrate by complex logical steps (presumably proving each passage referred to a slightly different situation, etc.) that no contradiction is obtained.  Orthodox Judaism considers revelation as propositional, explicit, verbal, and unambiguous. Revelation serves as a firm source of authority for religious commandments. Modernist understandings of revelation as a subjective, humanly-conditioned experience are rejected.   Some thinkers at the liberal end of the liberal wing promoted such views, although they found virtually no acceptance from the establishment.  \\n\nAn important ramification of Torah min HaShamayim in modern times is the reserved, and often totally rejectionist, attitude of Orthodoxy toward the historical-critical method, particularly higher Biblical criticism . The refusal by rabbis to employ such tools, insisting on traditional methods and the need for consensus and continuity with past authorities, separates the most liberal-leaning Orthodox rabbinic circles from the most conservative non-Orthodox ones.  : 115-119 \\n\nWhile the Sinai event is held to be the supreme act of revelation, rabbinic tradition acknowledges matters addressed by the Prophets and God\\'s later announcements . Kabbalah , as revealed to illustrious past figures and passed on through elitist circles, is widely (albeit not universally) esteemed. While some prominent rabbis considered Kabbalah a late forgery, most generally accepted it as legitimate. However, its status in determining normative halakhic decision-making, which is binding for the entire community, and not just for spiritualists who voluntarily adopt kabbalistic strictures, was always controversial. Leading decisors openly applied criteria from Kabbalah in their rulings, while others did so only inadvertently, and many denied it any normative role. A closely related mystical phenomenon is the belief in Magidim , supposed dreamlike apparitions or visions, that may inform those who experience them with certain divine knowledge.   \\n\nBelief in a future Messiah is central to Orthodox Judaism. According to this doctrine, a king will arise from King David\\'s lineage, and will bring with him signs such as the restoration of the Temple, peace, and universal acceptance of the God of Israel.  The Messiah will embark on a quest to gather all Jews to the Holy Land, will proclaim prophethood, and will restore the Davidic Monarchy.\\n\nClassical Judaism incorporated a tradition of belief in the resurrection of the dead .  : p. 1 The scriptural basis for this doctrine, as quoted by the Mishnah is:  : p. 24 \"All Israelites have a share in the World-to-Come, as it is written: \"And your people, all of them righteous, Shall possess the land for all time; They are the shoot that I planted, My handiwork in which I glory.\". The Mishnah also brands as heretics any Jew who rejects the doctrine of resurrection or its Torah origin.  : p. 25 Those who deny the doctrine are deemed to receive no share in the World-to-Come.  : p. 26 The Pharisees believed in both a bodily resurrection and an immortal soul. They also believed that acts in this world would affect the state of life in the next world.  : p. 61 Mishnah Sahedrin 10 clarifies that only those who follow the correct theology have a place in the World to Come.  : p. 66 \\n\nOther passing references to the afterlife appear in Mishnaic tractates. Berakhot informs that the Jewish belief in the afterlife was established long before the compilation of the Mishnah.  : p. 70 [ failed verification ] Biblical tradition mentions Sheol sixty-five times. It is described as an underworld containing the gathering of the dead with their families.  : p. 19 Numbers 16:30 states that Korah went into Sheol alive to describe his death in divine retribution.  : p. 20 The deceased who reside in Sheol have a \"nebulous\" existence. No reward or punishment comes in Sheol, which is represented as a dark and gloomy place. But a distinction is made for kings who are said to be greeted by other kings when entering Sheol.  : p.21 Biblical poetry suggests that resurrection from Sheol is possible.  : p. 22 Prophetic narratives of resurrection in the Bible have been labelled as an external cultural influence by some scholars.  : p. 23 \\n\nTalmudic discourse expanded on the details of the World to Come. This was to motivate Jewish compliance with religious codes.  : p. 79 In brief, the righteous will be rewarded with a place in Gan Eden , the wicked will be punished in Gehinnom , and the resurrection will take place in the Messianic age. The sequence of these events is unclear.  : p. 81 Rabbis support the concept of resurrection with Biblical citations and show it as a sign of God\\'s omnipotence.  \\n\nPractice\nA relatively thorough observance of halakha - rather than theological and doctrinal matters, which produce diverse opinions - is the concrete demarcation line separating Orthodoxy from other Jewish movements. As noted by researchers and communal leaders, Orthodox subgroups have a sense of commitment towards the Law, perceiving it as seriously binding, which is rarely visible outside the movement.  : 121-122 \\n\nThe halakha , like any jurisprudence, is not a definitive set of rules, but rather an expanding discourse. Its authority is derived from the belief in divine revelation, but rabbis interpret and apply it, basing their mandate on biblical verses such as and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee . From ancient to modern times, rabbinic discourse was wrought with controversy ( machloket ) and sages disagreeing over various points of law. The Talmud itself is mainly a record of such disputes. The Orthodox continue to believe that such disagreements flow naturally from the divinity of Jewish Law, which is presumed to contain a solution for any possible question. As long as both contesting parties base their arguments on received hermeneutics and precedents and are driven by sincere faith, both these and those are the words of the Living God (Talmudic statement originally attributed to a divine proclamation during a dispute between the House of Hillel and House of Shammai ).  Majority opinions were accepted and reified, though many disagreements remain unresolved as new ones appear. This plurality of opinion allows decisors , rabbis tasked with determining the legal stance in subjects without precedent, to weigh a range of options, based on methods derived from earlier authorities. The most basic form of halakhic discourse is the responsa literature , in which rabbis answered questions directed from commoners or other rabbis, thus setting precedent.  \\n\nThe system\\'s oldest and most basic sources are the Mishna and the Talmuds , augmented by the Geonim . Those were followed by the great codes which sought to assemble and standardize the laws, including Rabbi Isaac Alfasi \\'s Hilchot HaRif , Maimonides\\' Mishneh Torah , and Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel \\'s work (colloquially called the Rosh ). These three works were the main basis of Rabbi Jacob ben Asher \\'s Arba\\'ah Turim , which in turn became the basis of one of the latest and most authoritative codifications - the 1565 Shulchan Aruch , or \"Set Table\", by Rabbi Joseph Karo . This work gained canonical status and became almost synonymous, with the halakhic system. However, no later authority accepted it in its entirety (for example, Orthodox Jews wear phylacteries in a manner different from the one advocated there), and it was immediately contested or re-interpreted by various commentaries, most prominently the gloss written by Rabbi Moses Isserles named HaMapah (\"The Tablecloth\") . Halakhic literature continued to expand and evolve. New authoritative guides continued to be compiled and canonized, until the popular 20th century works such as the Mishnah Berurah arrived.\\n\nThe most important distinction within halakha is between all laws derived from God\\'s revelation ( d\\'Oraita ) and those enacted by human authorities ( d\\'Rabanan ), who are believed to have been empowered by God to legislate as necessary. The former are either directly understood, derived via various hermeneutics or attributed to commandments handed down to Moses. The authority to pass measures d\\'Rabanan is itself subject to debate - Maimonides stated that absolute obedience to rabbinic decrees is stipulated by the verse and thou shalt observe , while Nachmanides argued that such severity is unfounded, while accepting such enactments as binding, albeit less so than the divine commandments. A Talmudic maxim states that when in doubt regarding a matter d\\'Oraita , one must rule strenuously, but leniently when it concerns d\\'Rabanan . Many arguments in halakhic literature revolve over whether a detail is derived from the former or the latter source, and under which circumstances. Commandments or prohibitions d\\'Rabanan , though less stringent than d\\'Oraita , are an important facet of Jewish law. They range from the 2nd century BCE establishment of Hanukkah , to bypassing the Biblical ban on charging interest via the Prozbul , and up to the 1950 marital rules standardized by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel , which forbade polygamy and levirate marriage even in communities that still practiced them.  \\n\nA third major component buttressing Orthodox and other practice is local or familial custom, Minhag . The development and acceptance of customs as binding, more than disagreements between decisors, is the main source of diversity in matters of practice across geographic or ethnic boundaries. While the reverence accorded to Minhag across rabbinic literature covers the extremes, including \"a custom may uproot halakha \" and wholly dismissive attitudes,  it was generally accepted as binding by scholars, and drew its power from popular adherence and routine.\\n\nThe most important aspect of Minhag is in the disparities between various Jewish ethnic or communal groups, which each possess a distinctive tradition of halakhic rulings, stemming from the opinions of local rabbis. Ashkenazim , Sephardim , Teimanim , and others have distinct prayer rites , kosher emphases (for example, by the 12th century, it became an Ashkenazi custom to avoid legumes in Passover ) and other distinctions.\\n\nEating in the Sukkah on Shemini Atzeret   is an area where Minhag varies; likewise, how to accommodate the idea of eating some dairy on Shavuos .  The influence of custom upset scholars who noted that the common masses observe Minhag , yet ignore important divine decrees.\\n\nRabbinic leadership, assigned with implementing and interpreting tradition, changed considerably over the centuries, separating Orthodox from pre-modern Judaism. Since the demise of the Geonim , who led the Jewish world up to 1038, halakha was adjudicated locally, and the final arbiter was mostly the local rabbi, the Mara d\\'Athra (Master of the Area). He was responsible to judicially instruct his community. Emancipation and modern transport and communication made this model untenable.  While Orthodox communities, especially the more conservative ones, have rabbis who technically fill this capacity, the public generally follows more broadly known authorities who are not limited by geography, and based on reverence and peer pressure more than coercion. These may be either popular chairs of Talmudic academies , renowned decisors , and, in the Hasidic world, hereditary rebbe s.\\n\nTheir influence varies considerably: In conservative Orthodox circles, mainly Haredi, rabbis possess strong authority, and often exercise leadership. Bodies such as the Council of Torah Sages , Council of Torah Luminaries , the Central Rabbinical Congress , and the Orthodox Council of Jerusalem are all held as the arbiters in their respective communities. In the more liberal Orthodox sectors, rabbis are revered and consulted, but rarely exert direct control.\\n\nOrthodox Judaism emphasizes practicing rules of kashrut , Shabbat , family purity , and tefilah (daily prayer).\\n\nMany Orthodox can be identified by their dress and family lifestyle. Orthodox men and women dress modestly covering most of their skin. Married women cover their hair, with scarves ( tichel ), snoods , turbans, hats, berets, or wigs.\\n\nOrthodox men wear a ritual fringe called Tzitzit , and wear a head-covering for males.  Many men grow beards, and Haredi men wear suits with black hats over a skullcap. Modern Orthodox Jews may adopt the dress of general society, although they, too, wear kippahs and tzitzit. On Shabbat, Modern Orthodox men wear suits (or at least a dress shirt) and dress pants, while women wear clothing.\\n\nOrthodox Jews follow the laws of negiah (touch). The Orthodox do not engage in physical contact with those of the opposite sex other than their spouse, or immediate family members. Kol Isha  prohibits  a woman\\'s singing to a man (except as per negiah ).  \\n\nDoorposts have a mezuzah . Separate sinks for meat and dairy have become increasingly common.   \\n\nDiversity\nOrthodox Judaism lacks a central framework and a common leadership. It is not a \" denomination \" in the structural sense, but a spectrum of groups, united in broadly affirming matters of belief and practice, which share a consciousness and a common discourse. Individual rabbis often  gain respect across boundaries, particularly recognized decisors , but each community largely elevates its own leaders (for example, the ultra-Orthodox world shares a sense of common identity, while distinct subgroups include hundreds of independent communities with their own rabbis). The limits and boundaries of Orthodoxy are also controversial. No encompassing definition has found acceptance. Moderately conservative subgroups hotly criticize more liberal groups for deviation, while strict hard-liners dismiss the latter as non-Orthodox. Contentious topics range from the abstract and theoretical, such as the attitude toward the study of scripture, to the mundane and pressing, such as modesty rules.\\n\nAs in any other broad religious movement, an intrinsic tension connects the ideological and the sociological dimensions of Orthodox Judaism - while elites and intellectuals define adherence in theoretical terms, the masses use societal, familial, and institutional affiliation. The latter may be neither strictly observant nor fully accept the tenets of faith.  : 25-26, 76, 116-119, 154-156  \\n\nDemographics\nProfessors Daniel Elazar and Rela Mintz Geffen, according to calculations in 1990, found there to be at least 2,000,000 observant Orthodox Jews worldwide in 2012, and at least 2,000,000 additional members and supporters who identified as such. This estimate held Orthodoxy to be the largest Jewish group.   \\n\nIn the State of Israel , where the total Jewish population is about 6.5 million, 22% of all Jewish respondents to a 2016 Pew survey declared themselves as observant Orthodox (9% Haredim , or \"ultra-Orthodox\", 13% Datiim , \"religious\"). 29% described themselves as \" traditional \", a label implying less observance, but identification with Orthodoxy.  \\n\nThe Orthodox community of the United States is the second-largest in the world, concentrated in the Northeast and specifically in New York and New Jersey .  A 2013 Pew survey found that 10% of respondents identified as Orthodox, among a total Jewish population of at least 5.5 million. 3% were Modern Orthodox, 6% were ultra-Orthodox, and 1% were \"other\" ( Sephardic , liberal Orthodox, etc.)  \\n\nIn the United Kingdom, of 79,597 households with at least one Jewish member that held synagogue membership in 2016, 66% affiliated with Orthodox synagogues: 53% in \"centrist Orthodox\", and 13% in \"strictly Orthodox\" (further 3% were Sephardi, which technically eschews the title \"Orthodox\").  \\n\nThe Orthodox have higher birth rates than others. Ultra-Orthodox communities have some of the world\\'s highest birth rates, averaging six children per household. A nearly non-existent rate of intermarriage with members of other faiths (Orthodox vehemently oppose the phenomenon) contributes to their growing share of the world\\'s Jewish population. Among American Jewish children, the Orthodox share is an estimated 61% in New York, including 49% ultra-Orthodox. Similar patterns are observed in other countries. With present trends sustained, Orthodox Jews are projected to numerically dominate British Jewry by 2031, and American Jewry by 2058.     However, large numbers of members leave their communities and observant lifestyle. Among the 2013 Pew respondents, 17% of those under 30 who were raised Orthodox disaffiliated (in earlier generations, this trend was far more prevalent, and 77% of those over 65 left).  \\n\nGroups\nThe most recognizable sub-group is the Haredim (literally, \\'trembling\\' or \\'fervent\\'), also known as \"strictly Orthodox\", and the like. They are the most traditional part of the Orthodox. Haredim have minimal engagement with/wholesale rejection of modern society, avow precedence to religious values, and accept a high degree of rabbinic involvement in daily life. Haredi rabbis and communities generally accept each other, and accord them legitimacy. They are organized in large political structures, mainly Agudath Israel of America and the Israeli United Torah Judaism party. Other organized groups include the Anti-Zionist Central Rabbinical Congress and the Edah HaChareidis . They are easily discerned by their mode of dress, often mostly black for men and very modest, by religious standards, for women (including hair covering, long skirts, etc.).\\n\nThe ultra-Orthodox may be roughly classified into three sub-groups:\\n\nHasidic Jews originated in 18th-century Eastern Europe , where they formed as a revival movement that defied the rabbinical establishment. The threat of modernity turned the movement towards conservatism and reconciled it with traditionalist elements. Hasidism espouses a mystical interpretation of religion. Each Hasidic community aligned with a hereditary leader known as rebbe (who is almost always an ordained rabbi). While the spiritualist element of Hasidism declined through the centuries, the rebbe s\\' authority stems from the mystical belief that the holiness of their ancestors is inborn. They exercise tight control over their followers. Each of the hundreds of independent Hasidic groups/sects (also called \"courts\" or \"dynasties\") has its own line of rebbes . Groups range in size from large ones with thousands of member households to very small. Courts often possess unique customs, religious emphases, philosophies, and styles of dress. Hasidic men, especially on the Sabbath, don long garments and fur hats, which were once a staple of Eastern European Jews, but are now associated almost exclusively with them. As of 2016, 130,000 Hasidic households were counted.\\n\nThe second Haredi group are the Litvaks, or Yeshivish. They originated, loosely, with the Misnagdim , the opponents of Hasidism, who were mainly concentrated in old Lithuania . The confrontation with the Hasid bred distinct ideologies and institutions, especially great yeshivas , learning halls, where the study of Torah for its own sake and admiration for the scholars who headed these schools was enshrined. With the advent of secularization, the Misnagdim largely abandoned their hostility towards Hasidism. They became defined by affiliation with their yeshiva s, and their communities were sometimes composed of alumni. The prestige ascribed to them as centers of Torah study (after they were rebuilt in Israel and America, bearing the names of Eastern European yeshiva s destroyed in the Holocaust ) persuaded many who were not Misnagdic, and the term Litvak lost its original ethnic connotation. It is granted to all non-Hasidic Haredim of Ashkenazi descent. The Litvak sector is led mainly by heads of yeshiva s.\\n\nThe third ultra-Orthodox movement is the Sephardic Haredim , who live mostly in Israel. There they are linked to the Shas party and the legacy of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef . Originating in the Mizrahi (Middle Eastern and North African Jews) immigrants to the country who arrived in the 1950s, most of the Sephardi Haredim were educated in Litvak yeshivas. They adopted their educators\\' mentality. Their identity developed in reaction to the racism they encountered. Shas arose in the 1980s, with the aim of reclaiming Sephardi religious legacy, in opposition to both secularism and the hegemony of European-descended Haredim . While living in strictly observant circles, they maintain a strong bond with non-Haredi masses of Israeli Mizrahi society.\\n\nIn the West, especially in the United States, Modern Orthodoxy , or \"Centrist Orthodoxy\" , is an umbrella term for communities that seek an observant lifestyle and traditional theology, while at the same time ascribing positive value to engagement (if not \"synthesis\" ) with the modern world .   \\n\nIn the United States, the Modern Orthodox form a cohesive community, influenced by the legacy of leaders such as Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik , and concentrated around Yeshiva University and institutions such as the OU or National Council of Young Israel . They affirm strict obedience to Jewish Law, the centrality of Torah study, and the importance of positive engagement with modern culture.  \\n\nIn Israel, Religious Zionism represents the largest Orthodox public and are fervent Zionists . Religious Zionism supports Israel and ascribes an inherent religious value to it. The dominant ideological school, influenced by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook \\'s thought, regards the state in messianic terms. Religious Zionism is not a uniform group, and the split between its conservative flank (often named \" Chardal \", or \"National- Haredi \") and more liberal elements has increased since the 1990s. The National Religious Party , once the single political platform, dissolved, and the common educational system became torn on issues such as gender separation in elementary school or secular studies.\\n\nIn Europe, \"Centrist Orthodoxy\" is represented by organizations such as the British United Synagogue and the Israelite Central Consistory of France , both the dominant official rabbinates in their respective countries. The laity is often non-observant, retaining formal affiliation due to familial piety or a sense of Jewish identity.\\n\nAnother large demographic usually considered Orthodox are the Israeli Masortim , or \"traditionals\". This moniker originated with Mizrahi immigrants who were secularized and reverent toward their communal heritage. However, Mizrahi intellectuals, in recent years, developed a more reflective, nuanced understanding of this term, eschewing its shallow image and not necessarily agreeing with the formal deference to Orthodox rabbis. Self-conscious Masorti identity is limited to small, elitist circles.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nOur Lady of Lourdes\nOur Lady of Lourdes ( French : Notre-Dame de Lourdes ; Occitan : N\\xc3\\xb2stra Senhora de Lorda ) is a title of the Virgin Mary . She is venerated under this title by the Roman Catholic Church due to her apparitions that occurred in Lourdes , France . The first apparition of 11 February 1858, of which Bernadette Soubirous (age 14) told her mother that a \"Lady\" spoke to her in the cave of Massabielle (1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) from the town) while she was gathering firewood with her sister and a friend.  Similar apparitions of the \"Lady\" were reported on 18 occasions that year, until the climax revelation in which she introduced herself as: \"the Immaculate Conception \".  On 18 January 1862, the local Bishop of Tarbes Bertrand-Sév\\xc3 8re Laurence endorsed the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Lourdes.\\n\nOn 1 February 1876, Pope Pius IX officially granted a decree of canonical coronation to the image as Notre-Dame du Saint Rosaire . The coronation was performed by Cardinal Pier Francesco Meglia at the courtyard of what is now part of the Rosary Basilica on 3 July 1876.   \\n\nThe image of Our Lady of Lourdes has been widely copied and reproduced in shrines and homes, often in garden landscapes. Bernadette Soubirous was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1933.   \\n\nMarian devotion has since steadily increased as ecclesiastical investigations sanctioned her visions. In later years, a large church was built at the site that has since  become a major site of religious pilgrimage.\\n\nApparitions\nOn 11 February 1858, Soubirous went with her sister Toinette and neighbor Jeanne Abadie to collect some firewood. While taking off her shoes and stockings to wade through the water near the Grotto of Massabielle, she said she heard the sound of two gusts of wind ( coups de vent ) but the trees and bushes nearby did not move. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move.\\n\nI came back towards the grotto and started taking off my stockings. I had hardly taken off the first stocking when I heard a sound like a gust of wind. Then I turned my head towards the meadow. I saw the trees quite still: I went on taking off my stockings. I heard the same sound again. As I raised my head to look at the grotto, I saw a lady dressed in white, wearing a white dress, a blue girdle and a yellow rose on each foot, the same color as the chain of her rosary; the beads of the rosary were white \\xe2\\x80 6 From the niche, or rather the dark alcove behind it, came a dazzling light. \nSoubirous tried to make the sign of the cross but could not, as her hands were trembling. The lady smiled, and invited Soubirous to pray the rosary with her.  Soubirous tried to keep this a secret, but Toinette told her mother. After parental cross-examination, she and her sister received corporal punishment for their story.  \\n\nThree days later, 14 February, Soubirous returned to the grotto. She had brought holy water as a test that the apparition was not of evil origin/provenance: \"The second time was the following Sunday \\xe2\\x80 6 Then I started to throw holy water in her direction, and at the same time I said that if she came from God she was to stay, but if not, she must go. She started to smile, and bowed ... This was the second time.\"  \\n\nSoubirous\\' companions are said to have become afraid when they saw her in ecstasy. She remained ecstatic even as they returned to the village. On 18 February, she spoke of being told by the Lady to return to the Grotto over a period of two weeks. She quoted the apparition: \"The Lady only spoke to me the third time \\xe2\\x80 6 She told me also that she did not promise to make me happy in this world, but in the next.\"  \\n\nSoubirous was ordered by her parents to never go there again. She went anyway, and on 24 February, Soubirous related that the apparition asked for prayer and penitence for the conversion of sinners.\\n\nThe next day, she said the apparition asked her to dig in the ground and drink from the spring she found there. This made her dishevelled and some of her supporters were dismayed, but this act revealed the stream that soon became a focal point for pilgrimages.  Although it was muddy at first, the stream became increasingly clean. As word spread, this water was given to medical patients of all kinds, and many reports of miraculous cures followed. Seven of these cures were confirmed as lacking any medical explanations by Professor Verges in 1860. The first person with a \"certified miracle\" was a woman whose right hand had been deformed as a consequence of an accident. The government fenced off the grotto and issued stiff penalties for anybody trying to get near the off-limits area. In the process, Lourdes became a national issue in France, resulting in the intervention of Emperor Napoleon III with an order to reopen the grotto on 4 October 1858. The church had decided to stay away from the controversy altogether.\\n\nSoubirous, knowing the local area well, managed to visit the barricaded grotto under cover of darkness. There, on 25 March, she said she was told: \"I am the Immaculate Conception \" ( \"que soy era immaculada concepciou\" ). On Easter Sunday, 7 April, her examining doctor stated that Soubirous, in ecstasy, was observed to have held her hands over a lit candle without sustaining harm. On 16 July, Soubirous went for the last time to the grotto. \"I have never seen her so beautiful before,\" she reported.  \\n\nThe Catholic Church, faced with nationwide questions, decided to institute an investigative commission on 17 November 1858. On 18 January 1860, the local bishop finally declared that: \"The Virgin Mary did appear indeed to Bernadette Soubirous.\"  These events established the Marian veneration in Lourdes, which together with Fátima and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe is one of the most frequented Marian shrines in the world, and to which between 4 and 6 million pilgrims travel annually.\\n\nIn 1863, Joseph-Hugues Fabisch was charged to create a statue of the Virgin according to Soubirous\\'s description. The work was placed in the grotto and solemnly dedicated on 4 April 1864 in presence of 20,000 pilgrims.\\n\nThe veracity of the apparitions of Lourdes is not an article of faith for Catholics. Nevertheless, all recent popes have visited the Marian shrine at some time. Benedict XV , Pius XI , and John XXIII went there as bishops, Pius XII as papal delegate. He also issued an encyclical , Le p\\xc3 8lerinage de Lourdes , on the one-hundredth anniversary of the apparitions in 1958. John Paul II visited Lourdes three times during his pontificate, and twice before as a bishop.\\n\nSoubirous described the apparition as a jeune fille (\"young girl\") of about 14-15 years old; Soubirous insisted that the apparition was no taller than herself. At 1.40 metres (4 ft 7 in) tall, Soubirous was diminutive even by the standards of other poorly-nourished children.  \\n\nSoubirous described the apparition as dressed in a flowing white robe, with a blue sash around her waist. This was the uniform of a religious group called the Children of Mary , which, on account of her poverty, Soubirous was not permitted to join (although she was admitted after the apparitions).  Her aunt Bernarde was a long-time member.\\n\nThe statue that currently stands in the niche within the grotto of Massabielle was created by the Lyonnais sculptor Joseph-Hugues Fabisch in 1864. Although it has become an iconographic symbol of Our Lady of Lourdes, it depicts a figure which is not only older and taller than Soubirous\\' description, but also more in keeping with orthodox and traditional representations of the Virgin Mary. On seeing the statue, Soubirous was profoundly disappointed with this representation of her vision.  \\n\nIn nearby Lestelle-Bétharram , only a few kilometres from Lourdes, some shepherds guarding their flocks in the mountains observed a vision of a ray of light that guided them to the discovery of a statue of the Virgin Mary. Two attempts were made to remove the statue to a more prominent position; each time it disappeared and returned to its original location, at which a small chapel was built for it.  \\n\nIn the early 16th century, a 12-year-old shepherdess called Angl\\xc3 8ze de Sagazan received a vision of the Virgin Mary near the spring at Garaison (part of the commune of Monléon-Magnoac ), somewhat further away. Angl\\xc3 8ze\\'s story is strikingly similar to that of Soubirous: she was a pious but illiterate and poorly educated girl, extremely impoverished, who spoke only in the local language, Gascon Occitan, but successfully convinced authorities that her vision was genuine and persuaded them to obey the instructions of her apparitions. Like Soubirous, she was the only one who could see the apparition (others could apparently hear it); however, the apparition at Garaison\\'s supernatural powers tended toward the miraculous provision of abundant food, rather than healing the sick and injured. Mid-nineteenth century commentators noted the parallels between the events at Massabielle and Garaison, and interpreted the similarities as proof of the divine nature of Soubirous\\' claims.  At the time of Soubirous, Garaison was a noted center of pilgrimage and Marian devotion.\\n\nThere are also several similarities between the apparition at La Salette , near Grenoble , and Lourdes. La Salette is many hundreds of kilometres from Lourdes, and the events at La Salette predate those in Lourdes by 12 years. However, the Marian apparition at La Salette was tall and maternal (not petite and gentle like her Lourdes apparition) and had a darker, more threatening series of messages. It is not certain if Soubirous was aware of the events at La Salette.  \\n\nOn 18 January 1862, the Bishop of Tarbes Betrand Severt Laurence declared the following regarding the Marian apparitions:\\n\n\"We are inspired by the Commission comprising wise, holy, learned and experienced priests who questioned the child, studied the facts, examined everything and weighed all the evidence. We have also called on science, and we remain convinced that the Apparitions are supernatural and divine, and that by consequence, what Soubirous saw was the Most Blessed Virgin. Our convictions are based on the testimony of Soubirous, but above all on the things that have happened, things which can be nothing other than divine intervention.\" \nPontifical approbations\nReported healings\nThe location of the spring was described to Soubirous by an apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes on 25 February 1858. Since that time many thousands of pilgrims to Lourdes have followed the instruction of Our Lady of Lourdes to \"drink at the spring and wash in it\".\\n\nLourdes water has become a focus of devotion to the Virgin Mary at Lourdes. The Catholic Church has formally endorsed, although not dogmatic, for sick people to bathe and visit Lourdes for healing. Since the apparitions, many people have claimed to have been cured by drinking or bathing in it,  and the Lourdes authorities provide it free of charge to any who ask for it.  \\n\nAn analysis of the water was commissioned by then mayor of Lourdes, Monsieur Anselme Lacadé in 1858. It was conducted by a professor in Toulouse , who determined that the water was potable and that it contained the following: oxygen, nitrogen , carbonic acid , carbonates of lime and magnesia, a trace of carbonate of iron , an alkaline carbonate or silicate, chlorides of potassium and sodium , traces of sulphates of potassium and soda, traces of ammonia , and traces of iodine .  Essentially, the water is pure and inert. Lacadé had hoped that Lourdes water might have special mineral properties which would allow him to develop Lourdes into a spa town, to compete with neighbouring Cauterets and Bagn\\xc3 8res-de-Bigorre .  \\n\nTo ensure claims of cures were examined properly and to protect the town from fraudulent claims of miracles, the Lourdes Medical Bureau (Bureau Medical) was established at the request of Pope Pius X . It is completely under medical rather than ecclesiastical supervision. Approximately 7,500  people have sought to have their case confirmed as a miracle, of which 70   have been declared scientifically inexplicable by the bureau.  \\n\nSanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes\nThe Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes is a group of churches, religious buildings and places of worship on the site where the Lourdes apparitions occurred in 1858, in the town of Lourdes , in France . The area is owned and administered by the Roman Catholic Church and is a destination for millions of pilgrims coming to venerate Our Lady of Lourdes. The sanctuary holds devotional activities, offices, and ensures accommodation for pilgrims with disabilities and those assisting them. The 52 hectares area of the sanctuary includes the grotto of Massabielle where Bernadette Soubirous is said to have seen the Virgin Mary and three basilicas, known as the Upper Basilica , the Lower Basilica and the Underground Basilica . It also includes a church, several chapels, a calvary on a hill, an area of ground for gatherings, a square and alleys for processions, fountains providing Lourdes water to pilgrims, baths for immersion in Lourdes water, residences for sick and disabled pilgrims, and the offices of the Lourdes Medical Bureau .  The sanctuary is visited by millions each year, and Lourdes has become one of the prominent pilgrimage sites of the world. Large numbers of pilgrims travel to Lourdes each year in the hope of physical healing or spiritual renewal.\\n\nOther places of veneration\nVenerated images with pontifical decree\nIn popular culture\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

It\\'s listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Hacienda Iruena Manor House ,  and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones as the Labadie House .  \\n\nHistory\nBuilt in 1893, it is the only building still standing of an agricultural conglomerate where both coffee and sugar were planted and processed.  It belonged to the French family Pellot.\\n\nThe hacienda was sold to Juan Labadié in 1860. At the time of acquisition, the property had an area of 1,300 acres, of which three quarters were planted with coffee. The other quarter was divided between cane, timber and cattle.\\n\nJuan Labadié lived on the plantation until his death in 1893. His widow, Cornelia Pellot decided to demolish the old house of wood to build a new one made out of concrete.\\n\nAfter the Spanish-American War Puerto Rico became a commonwealth of the United States in 1898, the estate became solely a sugar plantation belonging to Central Coloso .\\n\nArchitecture\nPlans for the construction of the house started in 1893. The house was designed by Paul Servajean,  the administrator of the sugar mill \"Central Coloso\" in Aguada.  Serva conceived the design as a Caribbean adaptation of a Chateau in Ch\\xc3 2teauesque architecture .  The main element of the house is the front porch that is flanked by two towers. One of the towers originally housed the library of the house.\\n\nLa Llamarada\nThe house, under the name \"Hacienda Palmares de la Familia Moreau\", became immortalized in Puerto Rican literature by \" La Llamarada \", a novel about the Depression-era sugar cane industry written by Puerto Rican author Enrique Laguerre . He describes the house as it existed during the early 20th century, and the Moreau family are largely based upon the Labadies.  Laguerre recognized how the novel transformed the house into a legend, \"it\\'s like when a great man dies, and literature replaced history and the legend begins.\"   \\n\nIn 1993 the municipality of Moca acquired the property and restored the house calling it \"El Palacete Los Moreau\" in honor of the novel.  The estate is open free of charge to the public.

        "page_content": "Contents\nPanteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro\n\\n\nThe Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro (English: Román Baldorioty de Castro National Pantheon) is a tract of land in Barrio Segundo of the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico , originally designed as the city\\'s cemetery , but later converted into what has come to be a famous burial place. Established in 1842, it is Puerto Rico \\'s first (and only) national pantheon.   It is the only cemetery dedicated as a museum in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.   Prior to being dedicated as a Panteón Nacional, it was known as Cementerio Viejo or as Cementerio Antiguo de Ponce , [ a ] and is listed under that name on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places . The Pantheon is named after Román Baldorioty de Castro , a prolific Puerto Rican politician, and firm believer of Puerto Rican autonomy and independence . His remains are located here.  The Pantheon also houses a small museum about the history of autonomism in the Island, and it is currently used both as a park and a venue for the expression of culture and the arts.  It is called the Museo del Autonomismo Puertorriqueño .\\n\nPrior to being turned into a National Pantheon in 1991, it was known as Antiguo Cementerio de Ponce (Ponce\\'s Old Cemetery), to differentiate it from the newer (though now also over 100 years old) Cementerio Civil de Ponce (Ponce Civil Cemetery).  Built in 1842, after the design of Antonio Torruella,  the cemetery was enlarged in 1864, following the design of Nieto Blajol Iglesia. It closed in 1918.  \\n\nHistory\nOn 13 February 1838, the secretary of the Municipality of Ponce met with civic leaders of the \"Villa of Ponce\" to discuss plans for building a new cemetery. The existing cemetery was in deplorable and bad condition, and it posed a danger to public health.  Because the \"Villa of Ponce\" did not have the money to build the cemetery, a voluntary proportional contribution was established in which all neighbors were to contribute. A commission was named composed of one member of the Municipal Council and four neighbors of influence to open up a voluntary subscription, name a depository and to proceed with the construction of the cemetery until its completion. The project was to be carried out in a lot adjacent to the existing cemetery extending one hundred square \"varas\" (a measure of length equal to 0.84m. approximately). Named by vote to form the commission were the \"Sor Sindico\" \\'(secretary to the mayor of the \"Villa\") and the neighbor leaders Don Geronimo Ortiz, Don Tomas Souffront, Don Luis Font, and Don Mateo Maenamaxe. On 26 February 1838, the project was approved by the mayor of Ponce . However, it was not until 1842 that the project was started out with the contributions of the neighbors of the \"Villa\". In 1843, the cemetery was inaugurated under the auspices of the mayor of Ponce, Don Juan Rondon Martinez , also the first person to be buried there. In 1864 the cemetery was enlarged and repaired. The new work consisted of repairs and construction of the enclosing walls and pathways, construction of new niches and construction of a chapel and mortuary. In 1915 the cemetery was closed down.  \\n\nArchitecture and construction\nThe cemetery consisted of well-designed small mausoleums that were lined up following a central pathway followed by lateral ones, starting from the entrance of the cemetery to a chapel located at the end. Most structures were designed and constructed following the neoclassical style that prevailed at that time. This style consisted of the use of columns and pilasters following the Doric , Ionic or Corinthian order, barrel vaults, Greek pediments , Roman arches and other details characteristic of said style. The thick walls and piers were built using brick, mortar , and \"argamasa\" (a mixture of crushed brick, sand, stone aggregate and lime). The enclosing walls were built of brick and mortar, and the part of the walls built in 1864 were built using stone and mortar. It was built in 1842 and enlarged in 1864.  \\n\nSignificance\nVarious illustrious Puerto Ricans of transcendental importance are buried here. The most important person buried in the cemetery is Don Román Baldorioty de Castro , distinguished patriot, journalist, educator, writer, orator, and abolitionist . In 1870, he was elected delegate to the Courts of Cadiz, where he opposed the slavery system of the time. He was responsible for most of the liberty amendments. On 23 March 1873, the abolition of slavery was proclaimed by Baldorioty de Castro.  \\n\nAlso buried there are Don Juan Seix , founder of the Ponce Fire Department , and Don Juan Rondon Martinez , mayor of Ponce (founder of the cemetery and first person buried in it).  Another prominent mayor buried there is Salvador de Vives , who founded Hacienda Buena Vista .  Other people buried in the cemetery include Juan Morel Campos and Manuel G. Tavarez , distinguished composers and musicians, most famous for their danzas (folkloric music typical of Puerto Rico) compositions,  and tenor of kings Antonio Paoli .   It houses the remains of nationalist hero Casimiro Berenguer ,  and members of the prominent Seralles family,  founders of the Destileria Serralles , and after whom the Castillo Serralles took its name. Ex-governor Roberto Sanchez Vilella \\'s tomb is also buried there and the late mayor of Ponce, Rafael Cordero Santiago , has a mausoleum there.  \\n\nPhysical appearance\nThe cemetery plan is shaped as a rectangle measuring approximately 157.71 meters in length by 84.31 meters wide. It is attached to a rectangular-shaped lot at the north-east corner measuring about 32.80 meters in length by 25.03 meters wide, and a small rectangular lot where the mortuary used to be located, at the center of the south side of cemetery measuring about 14.13 meters wide by 8.97 meters in length.  \\n\nA small mortuary structure building used to stand at the entrance of the cemetery. Following this structure, small mausoleums , crypts and niches were lined up on a central pathway that led to a small chapel located at the center of the cemetery. The cemetery was totally enclosed by very high walls that still remain. Most mausoleums and crypts were constructed following the neo-classical style trend that prevailed at the time. Thick walls and piers were used as the main structural system. These were constructed using brick/\"argarnasa\", stone and mortar.  \\n\nThe cemetery was closed in 1915 and it deteriorated since then. By 1984, it became subjected to vandalism; crypts and mausoleums were plundered . On that year, it contained a variety of mausoleums, crypts and niches partially destroyed, and most of the cemetery was covered by heavy vegetation. The enclosing wall plaster had fallen down exposing the brick and stone to weather conditions.  \\n\nAround 1990, the city of Ponce managed to salvage it. It repaired and reconstructed it, turning it into a National Pantheon. The architect in charge if its 1991 design was Virgilio Monsanto.  The cemetery was at that time called Cementerio Viejo (English: Old Cemetery), but it was renamed Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro (English: Román Baldorioty de Castro National Pantheon). The city of Ponce also established a small museum about autonomism . The city has also commissioned the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico School of Architecture to perform a study to determine the viability and cost for the total reconstruction of the Pantheon.\\n\nCurrent use\nThe cemetery is not active for the burial of just-deceased people as it does not have an order by the Puerto Rico Department of Health to operate in that way due to the propensity of the terrain for landslides.

As of April 2014, the most-recently transferred remains were those of Madeleine Velasco Alvarado in 2008, Rafael Cordero Santiago in 2004, and Simon Moret Gallart in 1998.  In April 2014 the possibility of interment of the remains of Cheo Feliciano was being considered. Ponce Mayor Maria Melendez stated she would issue a municipal order to transfer Feliciano\\'s remains to the Panteon,  if possible after one year.  \\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

It is located in barrio Canas Urbano . The park commemorated its 30th anniversary on 11 February 2010.  It has a \"steady attendance\" of some 70 senior citizens. The park\\'s oldest member is 91 years old. The park\\'s managing  ranger is Roberto Castro Franceschi.  \\n\nLocation\nThe park is located  on Villa street, between the Clausells and Baldorioty sectors of barrio Canas Urbano .  The area is a mixed residential/commercial area on urban route PR-123 . The park sits on an underprivileged sector of the city. The park is a self-contained non-profit entity. It is managed by the Ponce municipal government. It serves exclusively the City's elderly population. The park is set \"in a calming setting among lush mahogany, avocado, almond, lemon and flamboyán trees.\"  \\n\nHistory\nIn the late 1960s, the park was an empty city lot with many tall trees, very few bushes and shrubbery, and some open semi-grassy areas.  Senior citizens of the area gravitated to the empty lot in the afternoons for its comfortable shade and for the inevitable conversations with other retired neighborhood seniors. With time, the senior made their way to the park with scrap chairs to make their longer stays more comfortable. It wasn\\'t long before a table or two also found their way there, making it possible for the retired seniors to share in a game of domino . Soon the domino games became a regular feature of the daily gatherings.  It was not long before the still-empty government lot had been \"appropriated\" by the seniors for their daily gatherings and domino games. The daily games gathered popularity and after a few years domino tournaments also took place.  At this time the park was locally known as Las Vegas , \"for its popular open-air kiosks with 12 game tables\".  \\n\nIn view of the need for a clean and safe gathering place for the seniors of the area, the city, fixed the \"park\", built permanently set poured concrete tables and chairs, added flower gardens with walkways as well as restroom facilities. The park was then inaugurated in 1980, under the administration of mayor José G. Tormos Vega .\\n\nA senior citizens center\nThe park also serves as the center for an array of community services oriented towards the senior citizens community.  Within the park are the offices of the non-profit organization running the park.  It has an eight-member staff including a social worker, a nurse, and a recreation leader.  \\n\nSome of the free services the park offers are: \\n\nReforestation effort\nIn November 2009, Parque del Retiro was selected for green reforestation effort sponsored by Telemundo , Doral Bank and the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nReferences\n18°00\\xe2\\x80\\xb236.61\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°37\\xe2\\x80\\xb235.44\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.0101694°N 66.6265111°W ﻿ / 18.0101694; -66.6265111 \\n"

It is located in Barrio Tercero at the entrance to the Ponce Historic Zone on Miguel Pou Boulevard, at the southern terminus of PR-1 .\\n\nFeatures\nThe park is a three- plaza park. All three plazas have gardens and marble benches. Setting the stage for the park is El Puente de los Leones (The Bridge of the Lions). It spans Rio Portugues and is the gateway to, not just Parque del Tricentenario, but to the Ponce historical district as well. It features two brass lions guarding the entrance: the older lion represents wisdom and experience, while the younger one stands for the glorious future.  \\n\nIts centerpiece is a plaza containing a fountain dedicated to Ponce\\'s most illustrious citizens. This plaza is known as Parque de los Ponceños Ilustres (the Illustrious Ponce Citizens Plaza). At either side of this plaza, and tucked in somewhat but facing side streets that lead to and return from the center of the city, are two separate areas dedicated to two of the most honored citizens of Ponce. The one on the right is dedicated to governor Rafael Hernandez Colon ; the one on the left is dedicated to governor Luis A. Ferre .  A large wall near Hernandez Colon\\'s right plazalette has the encryption, \" Ponce es del que nos visita. Ponce es nuestro \" (Ponce belongs to those who visit us.

        "page_content": "Contents\nParque de Bombas\n\\n\nThe Parque de Bombas (English: firehouse [ a ] ) is a historic former fire station in Ponce, Puerto Rico . It is one of Puerto Rico\\'s most notable buildings , with some considering it \"by far the most easily recognized landmark in the Island.\"  \\n\nThe Parque de Bombas is located at the Plaza Las Delicias town square, directly behind Ponce Cathedral . Originally built in 1882 as a pavilion for an exhibition, it became Puerto Rico\\'s first ever fire station.  In 1990, the fire station closed and was converted into a museum . It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 12 July 1984.  \\n\nHistory\nThe structure was built as the main exhibit pavilion for the 1882 Exhibition Trade Fair.  The Madrid -based central government assigned the task of designing and constructing it to a Spanish Army officer, Lt. Colonel Máximo de Meana y Guridi   who was also a trained architect and later served as Mayor of the city .  \\n\nThe building was unveiled at the fair.  After the fair concluded, the pavilion became a fire station. The first firefighters to work in the building were stationed on 2 February 1883.  In 1885, its official name was changed to Estación de Bomberos de Ponce (Ponce Fire Station).\\n\nIn 1920, the building was used briefly as the Mayor\\'s office as a result of the 1918 San Fermín earthquake that affected the city during that year.  \\n\nIn 1967 and due to the distinctive appearance and central location of this firehouse, the Ponce municipal flag was designed using the red and black colors of its iconic firehouse as its base colors.  The Fireman\\'s Band, originally played weekly concerts from an open second floor stage attached to Parque de Bombas.  Now known as the Ponce Municipal Band , the band continues to play every Sunday evening, though in different locations. On 12 May 1960, a new fire station was built nearby at the junction of Calle Mayor and Calle Cristina.   This new structure became the main fire station for the city, reducing Parque de Bombas to a secondary role.\\n\nCultural significance\nSince 1885, Parque de Bombas has been, and it is, an important cultural institution in Ponce. Its colors represent the city, its unique style represents a progressive and dynamic cultural center. The Banda Municipal de Ponce (formerly, the Fireman\\'s Band), originally played weekly concerts from an open second floor stage attached to Parque de Bombas,  now continues its plays every Sunday evening. Called \"Retretas\", they are part of a cultural program and tradition of the city of Ponce. The structure\\'s extremely unusual format represents the brave firemen of Ponce, and its history.  An inscription at Parque de Bombas reads, \" This building is a symbol and commemoration of the importance vested by the residents of Ponce in the service, self-denial and courage of the Ponce Firefighters Corps. It is for this reason that the Ponce Firefighters Corps remains symbolically on this Plaza, in the heart of the city of Ponce. \"  In 1943, the Firemen Services of Puerto Rico was created by legislation. Its main commitment is to extinguish fires, prevent fires, rescue services in natural disasters or emergencies, and to service the community.  \\n\nAppearance\nThe basic structure measure 65\\'-8\" in width by 26\\'-3\" in length. It is two stories high with a tower at each corner of the Calle Marina front facade.  The building is located in the city\\'s central \" Las Delicias Plaza \" and it is attached to the Cathedral of Ponce at its rear boundary. Structurally, it is a wooden frame building with a pitched roof covered with galvanized zinc sheets. Exterior cladding is horizontal 1\" by 6\" wooden siding. Doors and windows are wooden. The windows are of the fixed louvered type, long, narrow, and crowned by an oversized fixed fan light.  \\n\nThe building\\'s layout is a large, central space, flanked by two lateral towers, two stories in height, which opens to the main central area. The main central area is used as garage facilities for the fire trucks, and the two lateral towers are used as living quarters and exhibition areas. An elegant central two-sided stairway with elaborated cast iron railing leads to a mezzanine area used as administrative offices.  \\nSome interior partitions were removed from the first floor when the structure was altered for its new use as a firehouse in order to accommodate the machinery. The building has been kept in good condition throughout the years.  \\n\nArchitecture\nMeana designed the building with a strong Moorish influence, including its basic rectangular plan with towers at its front corners, its ornate fa\\xc3 7ade, its long and narrow windows with fans at its top and its bright colored paint scheme.  Gothic revival architecture was also an influence. The building is painted red and black, Ponce\\'s official colors. The interior is also very colorful, with vertical stripes of red and orange on the walls and a painted frieze with a fireman\\'s motif .  \\n\nMuseum\nAfter 108 years of service, Parque de Bombas was vacated by the Puerto Rico Firefighters Corps in 1990. It was converted into a museum of firefighting. The architect in charge of its restoration was Pablo Ojeda O\\'Neill.  The newer fire station was taken over by the Instituto de Música Juan Morel Campos in 2008.  Ponce\\'s central fire station is now located 1 km east of Parque de Bombas on Miguel Pou Boulevard.  \\n\nIn popular culture\nThe firehouse is featured on the front cover of La Sonora Ponceña \\'s LP salsa album titled \"Fuego en el 23!\".  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

It was the first park in the Caribbean to commemorate the abolition of slavery .  It was built in 1874 and renovated in 1956.\\n\nBackground\nSlaves were brought to Puerto Rico from Africa, starting in the early 16th century and lasting through the 19th century, to replace the local Indian slaves who had been decimated.  The new slaves worked the coffee , sugar cane , and gold mining industries in Puerto Rico. During the 18th century, as gold mining ceased to be one of the major industries in Puerto Rico, slaves worked mostly in coffee plantations and sugar cane fields.  By a royal proclamation of Spain slavery was abolished on 22 March 1873.  \\n\nHistory\nIn 1874, a year after the abolition of slavery, a group of citizens built a small park in memory of the historic event.  In 1880 Olimpio Otero , Juan Mayoral Barnés, and Román Baldorioty de Castro were instrumental in creating the concept for a park dedicated to the commemorating the abolition of slavery, the only such memorial in the Caribbean .  Juan Mayoral Barnés brought the idea for the creation of the park to the Ponce Municipal Assembly on 14 March 1880. It was unanimously approved by the Assembly, ratified by the Central Government, and confirmed by Royal Decree on 1 March 1881.  The park was built and opened in the 1890s. It had swing sets for children, a fountain with colorful fish, and a roller coaster .  \\n\nOn 6 May 1956,  under the administration of Ponce mayor Andrés Grillasca Salas , the roller coaster, swing sets and fish pond were removed, and replace with the current Concha Acústica amphitheater. The statue of the freed slave was added at the base of the obelisk.  The sculpture of the freed slave is a work of Victor Cott.  Also in 1956, the park\\'s Concha Acústica opened.  \\n\nLocation and features\nThe park is located on Avenida Hostos at the fork of Salud Street and Marina Street, immediately north of the 100-foot high Monumento a la abolición de la esclavitud . It sits across from the Darlington Building, Ponce\\'s first multi-story building, which was completed in 1952.  \\n\nThe park features a grassy green area with trees and masonry benches as well as two monuments to commemorate the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico : a monument depicting a black male slave with broken chains depicting he is a free man, and a 100-foot high obelisk , Monumento a la abolición de la esclavitud , which rises just behind the black iron sculpture of the freed slave to accentuates and give instance to the occasion. Between the green area of the park and the two monuments is the outdoors acoustic amphitheater known as La Concha Acustica (English: The Acoustic Shell) which completes the park in its triangular city block. \\n\nAfter almost 70 years of use with only minor maintenance, the park was renovated in 1956 by Francisco Porrata Doria , an architect from Ponce.   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\\n"

Its centerpiece is the historic Ceiba pentandra , a tree associated with the founding of the city. Now surrounded by the park with the same name, the emblematic 500-year-old Ceiba tree stands on the edge of the Ponce Historic Zone .   The park opened in 1984, under the administration of Mayor Jose Dapena Thompson .  A sign on the fence that surrounds the tree identifies its species as Ceiba pentandra .\\n\nLocation\nThe park is located on Comercio street, next to Rio Portugues in the Cuatro Calles sector of barrio San Antón.  Today the area is a mixed residential/commercial area on urban route PR-133 .  The park is managed by the Ponce municipal government.  The tree is about half a mile east of Plaza Las Delicias .\\n\nHistory\nThe park sits on an area believed to have been the site of the first settlement of Europeans in the Ponce region.  \"In the surroundings of the legendary Ceiba de Ponce, broken pieces of indigenous pottery, shells, and stones were found to confirm the presence of Taino Indians long before the Spaniards that latter settled in the area.\"  \\n\nIt has been said that this tree was already a large tree at the time of the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the New World . Reference is also made to a book that suggests the tree already existed in 1696, and an 1818 map of Ponce by Alejandro Ordóñez shows the location of the tree.   \\n\nIn 1916, the tree measured 118 feet in circumference, measured at 4 feet from the ground surface.   \\n\nThe tree\nThe feature of the park is the historic centuries-old tree. The tree is also known as \\'kapok\\' and \\'silk cotton\\' tree.  The scientific name of the tree is Ceiba pentandra . The legendary tree belongs to the genus Ceiba , of the species pentandra , and the family Bombacaceae .  The word Ceiba comes from a Taino word pronounced say-bah . Ceiba is one of the largest and tallest trees in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere . They have been known to reach heights of over 180 feet.  The tree is closely related to the peculiar baobab trees of Africa.  The Ceiba tree is also Puerto Rico\\'s official national tree.  \\n\nThe tree has recently been decaying and, on 30 December 2006, it lost a large limb that accounted for some 30 percent of its foliage at that time.  The channeling of Rio Portugues and the development of a nearby recreational area have been mentioned as possible causes for the rapid deterioration of the tree in recent years.  In June 2009, the environmentalist group ProOrnato Inc and the government of the municipality of Ponce joined efforts to preserve the old tree in a weekend-long event.  On 18 July 2011, however, the tree lost another large limb. After this event, only 35 percent of the remaining tree was estimated to still be alive.  \\n\nThe fruit of the Ceiba tree contains a fiber that is eight time lighter than cotton and five times more buoyant than cork. As such it was used as the flotation for early life preservers. In addition to these attributes, the fiber fully repels water, has a low thermal conductivity and is resistant to rot. A little known fact is that before synthetics were used for insulation materials, mattresses and pillows, these were stuffed with the fiber of the Ceiba tree fruit. It was recently discovered that the absorption capacity of this fiber is also higher than that of the polypropylene material normally used in the cleanup of environmental oil spills . \"The wood of the Ceiba tree is exceedingly lightweight and easily worked.

The park was designed by Bonin Orozco Arquitectos  and was inaugurated on 19 September 2012.  The park is unique in that it was designed to create a \"green lung\" in the city by using ecological mindset in its entirety, from the construction materials used to the design and other areas as well. Except for one tree that got relocated within the project, the new park made use of all the existing trees and shrubs as they existed on the site prior to the development of the park.  \\n\nHistory\nDesign of the park was by Bonnin Orozco Arquitectos.  The municipality started construction on 10 March 2010.  By February 2012, 46% of the construction had been completed.  It was scheduled to open in August 2012,   and the inauguration date was set for 24 August 2012,  but due to Hurricane Isaac that week, it was postponed several weeks. The park was finally inaugurated on 19 September 2012.  It was inaugurated with the animation of various artists including Dagmar , Glenn Monroig , Jackeline Capó and \\xc3\\x81ngel \\xe2\\x80\\x98Cuco' Peña .  \\n\nCost\nThe initial cost of the park is $4.5 million.  The park will link to,  but it is different from, another park also currently under construction called Parque Lineal Veredas del Labrador .    In addition, there are plans to extend Parque Ecologico southward to connect to Parque de la Ceiba .  \\n\nFeatures\nThe park will have an amphitheater with room for 672 people, a waving path, two pavilions for exhibitions, and a 466-feet artificial river.  The park will link to Parque Lineal Veredas del Labrador and to Parque Julio Enrique Monagas .   \\n\nSignature project\nParque Ecológico Urbano is a project of Ponce Mayor María Meléndez Altieri .

        "page_content": "Contents\nParque Nacional de las Cavernas del Río Camuy\n\\n\nThe Parque Nacional de las Cavernas del Río Camuy (English: Camuy River Cave National Park) is a cave system in Puerto Rico. It is located between the municipalities of Camuy , Hatillo , and Lares in northwestern Puerto Rico , but the main entrance to the park is located in Quebrada, Camuy.   The caverns are part of a large network of natural limestone caves and underground waterways carved out by the third-largest underground river in the world, the Río Camuy ( Camuy River ).   The cave system was \"discovered\" in 1958 and was first documented in the 1973 book Discovery at the Río Camuy ( ISBN 0-517-50594-0 ) by Russell and Jeanne Gurnee, but there is archaeological evidence that these caves were explored hundreds of years ago by the Taíno Indians, Puerto Rico\\'s first inhabitants.   Over 10 miles of caverns, 220 caves and 17 entrances  to the Camuy cave system have been mapped so far. This, however, is only a fraction of the entire system which many experts believe still holds another 800 caves. \\nOnly a small part of the complex is open to the public. The 268-acre park built around the cave system features tours of some of the caves and sinkholes, and is one of the most popular natural attractions in Puerto Rico.  After restorations necessitated by Hurricane Maria , a destructive storm that struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the park re-opened on March 24, 2021. It then closed again from September 2022 until February 2023 due to Hurricane Fiona .  \\n\nAttractions\n\"Cueva Clara de Empalme\" or Clara Cave is the main attraction at the Rio Camuy Cave Park. A single chamber of this cave system has been developed for the public, starting in 1986.  Regular cavern guided tour and audio tours are available at the site.  Since November 2010, night tours called ECO NIGHTS have been organized weekly under special reservations. The tours start with the screening a short movie in a 90-seat theater, explaining the Rio Camuy Cave System and site safety rules, followed by a train ride that takes visitors into the entrance of Clara Cave. The huge chamber is 700 ft (212m) in length and 215 ft (65m) high.  Once inside this chamber, visitors are able to see an entrance from the roof of \"Sumidero de Empalme\" that is 60m from the surface, as well as stalactites, stalagmites, unique formations and thousands of bats.\\n\nVisitors must be in good physical conditions in order to walk into \"Cueva Clara\" and reach \"Sumidero y Cueva Espiral\" to see the mouth of this cave.  They must go down to it through a scenic 205-step boardwalk. The challenge is getting the way back to the tram. Once walking down the 205 steps into the sinkhole, the cave itself is off limits to reach.  Only experienced spelunkers can penetrate the cave and the underground river with special permission from the National Parks Company of Puerto Rico. This sinkhole is believed to have once been an enormous cavern that collapsed thousands of years ago. At the opening of the cave there is an impressive sight.\\n\n\"Sumidero Tres Pueblos\" is a giant sinkhole measuring 650 ft (195m) wide.  The Camuy River can be seen 400 ft (120m) below from three observation platforms that are located at different points alongside the opening of the impressive crater. The sinkhole is located where the borders of the towns of Camuy, Hatillo and Lares meet.  Each town has its own platform overlooking the sinkhole.\\n\nStatistics\nThe Camuy River Cave Park is home to more than 13 species of bats, and hundreds of other insect, arachnid and frog species.\\n\nThe Río Camuy is the world\\'s third-largest subterranean river.\\n\nThe park closes once reaches its 1,500 visitors daily capacity.\\n\n16 entrances, over 220 caves, two other smaller cave systems and more than 10 miles have been mapped so far and experts still say the cave system could be much larger.\\n\nGallery\nBooks and articles\nReferences\n18°19\\xe2\\x80\\xb232\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°50\\xe2\\x80\\xb217\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.32556°N 66.83806°W ﻿ / 18.32556; -66.83806 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPaseo Atocha\n\\n\nPaseo Atocha is a pedestrian shopping mall in the Ponce Historic Zone , a historic district in Ponce , Puerto Rico . For over a century the narrow Calle Atocha was bustling retail center opened to vehicular traffic,  yet flooded with shoppers.  Congestion and pedestrian safety led the municipal government to close the two blocks of Calle Atocha from Calle Isabel to Calle Vives to motor vehicles in 1991. Several years later, the closure was expanded to include the block from Calle Vives to Calle Victoria. This last segment coincides with the western perimeter of the historic Plaza de Mercado Isabel II city market. Not the bustling commercial spot it once was, today it is still actively frequented by shoppers, though in much reduced numbers. It is visited annually by thousands of locals and tourists alike and is considered one of the city's main places of interest.  \\n\nHistory\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, Calle Atocha was the main commercial artery in Ponce. It was the first street in the city to be built with the necessary incline as to allow rainwater to run freely away from buildings and walkways.  Despite modifications undergone by many of the building owners along this stretch of Atocha Street throughout the years, a number of buildings continue to preserve the original design characteristics of Ponce's traditional architecture , while others take on the traditional character of bygone years. In 1991, as part of the Ponce en Marcha (Ponce On the Move) plan, the government of the Municipality of Ponce closed the street to vehicular traffic and converted into a pedestrian promenade.  \\n\nUses\nDuring the day, and especially on Saturdays, the street gets crowded with shoppers, both from Ponce as well as from surrounding towns. In the evenings and on Sundays the street becomes as peaceful and relaxing place. There are some benches along the mall, and it is a good place to stop, take a rest, and do some people watching .  Sunday nights, Atocha turns into a calm place, and sometimes serves as a gathering place for cultural activities.  \\n\nShopping experience\nThe promenade is a lively place, and shoppers can find almost anything they need here. There are many clothing, jewelry, electronics, souvenir, etc., stores and restaurants. Many merchants have booths or racks along the Paseo. Most of the stores have discounted merchandise.  Police are stationed at every block along the Paseo, making the promenade quite safe.  \\n\nPaseo Atocha also includes he privately-owned Casa Vives , the only historic structure listed in the United States\\' Park Service National Register of Historic Places Program located within Paseo Atocha.  \\n\nFuture plans\nIn an attempt to make the downtown area more friendly to tourists and businesses, the City planned to install a reinforced crystal ceiling and air-conditioning system over the Paseo. Construction was planned to begin in 2009.  The idea was something the city had been toying around with for the last two decades. It is expected to cost $5 million USD .  The glass ceiling is expected to make Ponce's Historic District more attractive to vacationers and locals alike. At the same time, officials hope that it will draw new people to the area, allowing businesses to extend their hours of operation, and thereby boosting the downtown economy and stimulating nightlife .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°0\\xe2\\x80\\xb246.91\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°36\\xe2\\x80\\xb248.92\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.0130306°N 66.6135889°W ﻿ / 18.0130306; -66.6135889 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPaseo de la Princesa\nPaseo de la Princesa ( English : Promenade of the Princess or Princess Promenade ), is a partially waterside 19th-century pedestrian promenade about .50 miles (0.80 km) in length, located in the historic district of Old San Juan in Puerto Rico . Constructed between 1852 and 1854 in honor of Queen Isabella II of Spain 's first-born , Princess of Asturias Infanta Isabel , the promenade runs adjacent and parallel to the southwestern section of the Walls of Old San Juan .   Lined with Victorian lampposts and benches, large trees and gardens, and varying fountains and sculptures, it hosts food and artisan vendors, musical and theatrical entertainers , and cultural restaurants and festivals.  \\n\nThe promenade starts at Bastión de la Derecha de San Justo y Pastor on the Walls of Old San Juan in Marina , the southernmost sub-barrio in Old San Juan on the San Juan Islet , passing through passing by the Antigua Prisión La Princesa ( Old La Princesa Prison ) from 1837, currently housing the Puerto Rico Tourism Company , and the popular Fuente Raíces (Roots Fountain), a large sculptural fountain overlooking San Juan Bay since 1992 that represents Puerto Rican identity , a mixture of Taino , Spanish , and Sub-Saharan African ancestry and culture, and ending in the southwestern sub-barrio of Catedral in Old San Juan at the beginning of the western section of the Walls of Old San Juan at Puerta de San Juan (San Juan Gate), formerly known a s Puerta de Agua (meaning \\'water gate\\'), which lies next to La Fortaleza , the 16th-century executive residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico , and is the starting location of Paseo del Morro (Morro Promande) , the waterfront promenade covering the rest of the western section of the defensive walls, culminating on Punta del Morro (Morro Point) at the bottom of Castillo San Felipe del Morro at the westernmost position on San Juan Islet overlooking the entrance to San Juan Bay .    \\n\nOverview\nPaseo de la Princesa is often described as one of the most scenic city walkways in the world and, as a result of its location close to the cruise ship harbor, it is often the starting point for sightseeing in Old San Juan .  \\n\nLocated on a plaza at the midpoint of the promenade, Fuente Raíces (Roots Fountain) is a 1992 sculpture fountain by Spanish sculptor Luis Sanguino  representing and celebrating the ancestral roots of the Puerto Rican identity : the European culture brought by the Spanish and other settlers, the African culture by the Sun-Saharan African slaves and the indigenous culture by the native Taino .  This plaza also hosts a small wooden dock that offers great views of San Juan Bay , El Yunque and the Sierra de Luquillo to the east, and of other municipalities, such as Cataño and Bayamón to the west.\\n\nThe only remaining city gate on the Walls of Old San Juan , the iconic Puerta de San Juan ( San Juan Gate ), originally called the Puerta de Agua ( Water Gate ) because it was the first gate to offer water access to the city of Old San Juan , is found at the end of the promenade. The gate is near La Fortaleza , Capilla del Cristo and Parque de las Palomas . There is also waterside promenade named Paseo del Morro that continues along the western defensive walls towards El Morro at the entrance to San Juan Bay .\\n\nOther landmarks and attractions are the Americas Heritage Fountain , the San Justo y Pastor Bastion , the La Concepción Bastion , and a playground for children. The promenade also hosts an open air café and a restaurant that serves traditional Puerto Rican food called Princesa Gastrobar .  Piraguas , piña coladas and platanutres (fried plantain chips) are popular drinks and snacks to buy in the esplanade.  During the weekends and festival celebrations, one can find live music, street vendors, traditional street food and temporary art exhibitions. There is live jazz on Fridays and Saturdays, and salsa music and dance on Saturdays and Sundays.  \\n\nHistory\nIn 1837, the interim prison of Antigua Prisión La Princesa (The Princess Old Prison ), originally known as Real Cárcel La Princesa (The Princess Royal Jail ), was first built in the named after Queen Isabella II of Spain , who in 1833 was proclaimed sovereign at the age of three following her father Ferdinand VII 's death. \\n\nIn 1854, Puerto Rico\\'s Governor and Lieutenant General Don Fernando de Norzagaray foresaw an expansion of the prison and the construction of its tower. The prison had capacity for about 240 prisoners and continued to operate until 1965.  \\n\nWhile the promenade itself dates to the 1850s, its location was originally used by the Spanish military as a cleared field of fire for the cannons and guns that were located outside of the Walls of Old San Juan. \\n\nThe promenade and surrounding areas fell into disrepair during the 20th century, but it was rehabilitated and restored in 1989. The Puerto Rico Tourism Company is now headquartered at the former prison. The company also installed a time capsule in 1995, located under the promenade section in front of the historic building. The time capsule was opened in 2020, and two more were installed afterwards. These capsules are stated to be opened in 2045.  La Princesa prison building also houses a small art exhibition and often hosts cultural events.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPaseo Tablado La Guancha\n\\n\nPaseo Tablado La Guancha ( English : La Guancha Boardwalk ) is a boardwalk in the La Guancha sector of the Playa barrio in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico , facing the Caribbean Sea . It was built under the mayoral administration of Rafael Cordero Santiago , Mayor of Ponce from 1989 to 2004, at a cost of 2.6 million dollars,  and inaugurated on 23 June 1998.  It receives over 750,000 visitors a year.  In September 2017 the boardwalk was damaged by Hurricane Maria and the area closest to the water was fenced off and off-limits to the public, but the rest of the facilities continued to operate uninterrupted. In January 2020, however, while still fenced off from the 2017 hurricane damage, the boardwalk\\xe2\\x80\\x94together with its adjoining recreational complex\\xe2\\x80\\x94closed when the area suffered severe damage from the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes and, as of 17 June 2020, it remained closed.  By late 2020 arrangements were made for the merchants that operated from waterfront kiosks to reopen their businesses out of provisional facilities at a temporary location away from the waterfront while reconstruction of the waterfront area takes place.\\n\nDescription and amenities\nThe Paseo Tablado La Guancha is located in Ponce\\'s sea shore. Built in the 1990s, the boardwalk overlooks the Club Náutico de Ponce and has many restaurants and bars. It also has kiosks which sell food and alcoholic beverages. \"It\\'s basically a boardwalk filled with many different local eateries. They mostly sell delicious \\'fritters\\', like what we call \\'bacalaitos\\', or fried cod fish [turnovers]. There are also \\'empanadillas\\', which are basically fried meat- or cheese-filled turnovers. Apart from the food, the boardwalk is a great place to relax and take a light stroll. At one end of the boardwalk there is a lookout tower, giving an elevated view of La Guancha. You can see many big tarpons . These are not the prettiest, and do something really weird with their mouths once in a while. Just outside the boardwalk there are fun playgrounds for kids and a cool arcade. Ponce\\'s beach is very near the boardwalk, you can even walk to it.\"  There is also a marina where visitors can rent pedal boats and kayaks to explore the bay, an open-space stage for social and other similar activities, and an observation tower from where the Cardona Island Lighthouse can be seen. A 45-minute boat ride is also available to Caja de Muertos , a small island that features the 1887 Caja de Muertos Lighthouse and several beaches .\\n\nAtmosphere\nThe Paseo Tablado La Guancha is a good place to mingle with local Ponceños . Some visitors simply contemplate the water and relax while catching a cool breeze. During weekends it becomes livelier, with much live salsa music and large crowds. Except for Mondays and Tuesdays, the boardwalk is usually quite a lively place and great for people-watching.  \\n\nRecent developments\nIn September 2017, the boardwalk was damaged by Hurricane Maria .  On 7 January 2020 La Guancha was damaged again and made inoperable by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake so that twenty-four establishments had to shut down their operations.   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading"

The mall has a food court in its second floor and several offices in its third floor.\\n\nHistory\nStarting development as early as 1972 and being scheduled for completion by 1976, it was estimated to generate at least $75 million dollars in retail sales annually during its first 3 years of operation and over $100 million thereafter.  The mall was developed and was owned at the time by Plaza Carolina Associates, a coordinated project between General Growth Properties and IBEC. Eduardo Molinari was the architect for the project.  \\n\nOn September 27, 1978, JCPenney would officially inaugurate its store at the mall. The JCPenney store, whose physical extension covered 270,000 square feet (25,000 m 2 ), was the first store to open its doors in Plaza Carolina, and according to a spokesperson, it was the largest store in sales volume that the chain had ever opened in its entire history. It would create more than 400 new jobs in the area.  \\n\nFirst having a soft opening with its anchors on the 9th, the mall finally opened on October 11, 1978.  It opened with more than 100 stores, including 3 anchor stores, and parking for 5,000 cars.  Its three main anchor stores at the time were, Sears , JCPenney , and a 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m 2 ) González Padín .  It also opened with a 2-level, 37,000 sq ft (3,400 m 2 ) Woolworth store, which would additionally open with a \"Harvest House\" restaurant.  Later, a 26,379 sq ft (2,450.7 m 2 ) Tiendas Capri was added.  \\n\nOn September 28, 1979,  a 2-level, 65,000-square-foot (6,000 m 2 ) Velasco department store opened at the mall.  It was supposed to be a high point for the chain, but it proved unsuccessful. The store was located in an area of families with modest means, and its high prices were not compatible with the economic situation of the time, which caused low sales. The store announced its closure on August 26, 1981.  It was liquidated and closed by August 29, 1981.  The first level of the store was turned into what is now known as \"La Plazoleta\", the food court in the mall, and the second level of the former store was turned into office space. One of the first spaces to open at La Plazoleta was a Tex Critter\\'s Pizza Jamboree restaurant, the first for the chain outside the United States.  \\n\nIn October 1981, Plaza Carolina celebrated its third anniversary with a special appearance by Sophia Loren on October 24. Recent additions to the center and upcoming new stores were showcased by the assistant manager Norman Meléndez. He highlighted Marki-II, a new children\\'s store in operation in the second level of the mall offering children\\'s clothing, and various children\\'s items and accessories. Preciosa, which specialized in cosmetics and perfumes, had also opened its second store, located on the lower level, just east of the sun sculpture in the center of the mall. Land of Oz, an electronic games room had just finished its third expansion. Another new store was El Criollito, located in the \"La Plazoleta\" food court, specializing in Creole foods for Puerto Rican tastes. Several other stores were also under construction including: Radio Shack , Fashion Warehouse, Value Slacks, and the Sandwich Marker, an addition to La Plazoleta. These eventually opened to the public. Part of the space formerly occupied by Velasco would be remodeled to accommodate several small commercial spaces. At the same time, the attached food court would be expanded to offer a restaurant area.  \\n\nIn August 1982, in sales per square foot, it was among the highest 10 percent of mall-type shopping centers in the entire United States. It had never gone through any economic problems since it had opened its doors; at this point, it had always increased sales, year-on-year.  \\n\nIn December 1989, it was announced that the mall would be undergoing a massive renovation to begin by January 1990. EQK Partners which had acquired the mall a year earlier planned these renovations to be completed by November 1990. Costs for these ambitious renovations were said to go over $7 million dollars, with around 200 construction workers working on the massive project. This renovation included a full facelift for the mall, with new entrances, a new fountain, and a new color scheme.  \\n\nOn November 15, 1990, Plaza Carolina was officially reinaugurated after the $7 million renovations. Among the changes, Richard Gelber, architect of the Shapiro, Petrauskas and Gelber company, in charge of remodeling project, indicated that new colors were used on facades to reflect the tropical environment of the island. New entrances were created with glazed ceramic tiles, pink stucco, diagonal candle-shaped walls, and neon lights that illuminate the interior and exterior of the center. They also installed skylights in the ceilings over the central areas with a lattice to let in natural light. A fountain surrounded by tropical plants was built in the central area that could be covered and become a stage for special events, since it had seats for the public placed in the form of an amphitheater. The decoration included the installation of glazed tiles topped with shiny metal and neon bands on the corridor columns. Reopening celebration activities for the public were announced by the marketing director, Josefina Cantellops. During this time the mall had a total of 1.1 million square feet of retail space with 170 stores, and it was primarily anchored by JCPenney , Sears , González Padín , Woolworth , Tiendas Capri, and a Pueblo Xtra .  \\n\nIn October 1995, González Padín ceased operations after a failed buyout by the retailer Dillard\\'s which was supposed to save the department store; for unknown reasons the deal never happened, causing the permanent closure of González Padín.  Over the passing years the former space of González Padín was subdivided into a mall entrance, and a Forever 21 .\\n\nIn October 1998, under the Lend Lease Corporation an agreement was made with LaSalle Partners Incorporated to acquire from Lend Lease the then current owners of the mall Compass Retail Management and Leasing operations for an estimated $180 million dollars with provisions for an earnout payment of up to $77.5 million dollars over 5 years, of which Plaza Carolina was included.  \\n\nIn 1999, the mall underwent a $25 million expansion and renovation which added over 60,000 square feet (5,600 m 2 ) in retail, a 12-screen CineVista Theatres , and a 510,000-square-foot (47,000 m 2 ) parking deck.  \\n\nIn August 2000, after its major expansion, Plaza Carolina reported that it continued to add stores to its tenant mix. Its most recent arrivals at the time included island-newcomers Rainbow , Styles, and d.e.m.o. as well as Frank Mora, which already had a local presence. Charlotte Russe and Old Navy were scheduled to open in September and November, respectively. The 3,857 sq ft (358.3 m 2 ) Rainbow store featured clothing, accessories, and footwear for women. Styles would also offer fashionable clothing and accessories for women and juniors in its 3,369 sq ft (313.0 m 2 ) store. Specializing in hip-hop style, d.e.m.o. would include the Sean John line from singer-producer Puff Daddy in its Plaza Carolina store, which covered 2,641 sq ft (245.4 m 2 ) and was the largest of the U.S.-based chain, according to Juliana Castillo, the mall\\'s marketing manager. The Frank Mora store, with 2,265 sq ft (210.4 m 2 ) of retail space, would be the only one its stores that catered to both men and women. The Old Navy store would measure 17,313 sq ft (1,608.4 m 2 ) and would occupy the site once used by Woolworth on the first level. Charlotte Russe, also to be on the mall\\'s first level, would measure about 9,000 sq ft (840 m 2 ).  \\n\nIn May 2004, Simon Property Group Inc. completed its 100 percent interest from LaSalle Partners in Plaza Carolina for $309 million dollars. At the time, the mall had maintained a 98-percent-average occupancy rate over the last five years, generating total annual sales of approximately $275 million and sales per square foot of over $450.  \\n\nIn January 2008, the CineVista Theatres shuttered due to bankruptcy.  Later in May 2017, it was announced that a new Caribbean Cinemas would be opening in Spring 2018, bringing the mall back to having a cinema.  Caribbean Cinemas previously had a presence at the mall from 1996 until 1998 when it was moved to Plaza Escorial .\\n\nIn Spring 2011, Simon Property Group announced that the plaza, a major shopping destination for 33 years, would be completely renovated beginning the Spring of 2011. Said mall renovations would include new interior and exterior features and amenities such as additional seating, updated restrooms, redesigned mall entrances, landscaping, flooring, and lighting. These renovations were completed by 2012.  \\n\nIn 2014, Sports Authority and Men\\'s Wearhouse were opened.  \\n\nIn 2016, Sports Authority closed after only two years in operation at the site due to bankruptcy.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017, the mall was heavily damaged by Hurricane Maria when it struck Puerto Rico, leaving the mall in serious disarray.  The mall was later repaired.\\n\nIn January 2020, it was announced that Best Buy would be closing on February 28, 2020, as they decided to not renew their lease.  \\n\nOn December 23, 2020, it was announced that Sears would also be closing as part of a plan to close 23 stores nationwide. The store closed in February 2021.  \\n\nIn early 2020, DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse was closed at the mall for unknown reasons.\\n\nIn October 2021, a Burlington opened in the former Best Buy.  \\n\nCurrent anchors\nFormer stores\nSee also\nReferences"

This plaza and its fountain commemorate the explorer Christopher Columbus , whose name in Spanish was Cristóbal Colón.  The plaza presents the traditional urban relationship in Puerto Rico with the church, now Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria Cathedral on one end of the plaza and the \"Alcaldia\" or Mayagüez town hall in the other.  Its location was designated in 1760 close to the city founding.  \\n\nThe plaza is paved in marble is graced by a group of lampposts in bronze that date over more than one hundred years.  Each lamp is held by an oriental odalisque , including characteristic clothes, turbans, and veils.  The plaza was designed after the Great Fire of 1841 , approximately in 1842; years later, after being paved the plaza had a fountain in the center.  The plaza has been remodeled several times including when Benjamin Cole was mayor and under the current mayor José Guillermo Rodríguez .\\n\nStatues\nFollowing the theory that Columbus disembarked in Mayagüez; in 1896 a statue of the Admiral was placed in the main plaza in the city, thus it came to be known as Plaza Colón.  The statue was made by A. Coll y Pí in Barcelona in 1843.   \\n\nIn 1944 a monument to the city founders was constructed in the plaza.  In 1944 Regino Cabassa made great efforts to get the creation of a Monuments to the founders of the city in the Plaza Colon.  At first there were some obstacles especially since the monument was to be built of bronze and because of World War II that metal was hard to come by. But finally on November 19, 1944, the monument was unveiled before Mayor Don Manuel A. Barreto.  \\n\nGallery\nNotes\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza Colón (San Juan)\nPlaza Colón ( Spanish for Columbus square or plaza ), formerly called Santiago Square , is a plaza or public town square located in Old San Juan where the easternmost city walls and main city gate (Puerta de Santiago) used to be located. The square today is a popular meeting place and is often used as a starting point for sightseeing in Old San Juan as it is located close to the main cruise ship docks, numerous restaurants, cafés and gift shops, and important landmarks such as San Cristóbal Castle , Tapia Theater , the Old Casino and the Puerto Rico Capitol .\\n\nHistory\nThe area was originally considered an important transportation and social center in San Juan. The Tapia Theater was built around this time and inaugurated in 1832.  The Christopher Columbus statue was first erected in the area in 1893 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the European \"discovery\" of Puerto Rico.  The statue of Juan Ponce de Leon that used to be located in the center of the square was moved to Plaza San Jose (next to San Jose Church ). Before its construction in 1897, the plaza used to be the eastern end of the defensive wall system that surrounded San Juan. It used to be the location of one of the main city gates, Santiago Gate . This section of the wall was torn down in the May of 1897 as it was deemed unnecessary and it was considered an obstacle to San Juan\\'s economic growth as the walled district was isolated from the rest of the modern city. The statue of Columbus atop its column at the center of the square caused people to start referring to the plaza as Plaza Colón rather than Plaza Santiago.  The square today is paved with marble tiles and lightened by adorned lamp posts which were installed during the revitalization of the area in the latter half of the 20th century.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\n18°27\\xe2\\x80\\xb258\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°06\\xe2\\x80\\xb244\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.4662°N 66.1121°W ﻿ / 18.4662; -66.1121 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza Degetau\n\\n\nPlaza Degetau , formally Plaza Federico Degetau , is the larger of two plazas at Plaza Las Delicias , the main city square in the city of Ponce , Puerto Rico . The other plaza is named Plaza Muñoz Rivera and is located north of Plaza Degetau. The square is notable for its fountains and for the various monuments it contains. The historic Parque de Bombas and Ponce Cathedral buildings are located bordering the north side of this plaza. The square is the center of the Ponce Historic Zone , and it is flanked by the historic Ponce City Hall to the south, the cathedral and historic firehouse to the north, the NRHP -listed Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño and Banco de Ponce buildings to the east, and the Armstrong-Poventud Residence to the west. The square dates back to the early Spanish settlement in Ponce of 1670. It is the main tourist attraction of the city, receiving about a quarter of a million visitors per year.  \\n\nHistory\nAccording to the traditional Spanish colonial custom, a town\\'s main square, or plaza, was the center of the town. In the case of Ponce, a Catholic church was built on the center of the plaza, thus splitting the plaza into two sections.  Plaza Degetau (the subject of this article) is the southern of the two sections (see \"Diagram of Plaza Las Delicias\" herein), with the other plaza, Plaza Muñoz Rivera , located to the north of Plaza Federico Degetau . Plaza Degetau measures 6,400 square meters.  \\n\nThe history of Plaza Degetau dates back to as far as the creation of the first Catholic chapel in Ponce in 1670.  It is also known that around 1840 Mayor Salvador de Vives planted trees as a renovation project for plaza.  It was first lit in 1864.  The plaza, as it stands today, was designed by architect Francisco Porrata-Doria in 1914.  \\n\nIn addition to the cathedral and the firehouse, Plaza Degetau at one point also contained an open dining Moorish -style kiosk that had been part of the 1882 Fair Exposition.  The kiosk was still present at the time of the American invasion of the island in 1898 as reported by American photo-journalist William Dinwiddie ,  but it was demolished in 1914.  \\n\nName\nPlaza Degetau was originally called Antigua Plaza Real (Old Royal Plaza),  and later, Plaza Mayor (Main Plaza).  In the early 20th century its name was officially changed to Plaza Federico Degetau, in honor of Federico Degetau , the first Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico to the United States House of Representatives.\\n\nFeatures\nPlaza Degetau is perhaps the best known of the two plazas and the one most often seen in pictures.\\n\nIn the center of this plaza lies the famous Fuente de los Leones (Lions Fountain). The large, round-shaped fountain is bounded by a low, marble and granite wall. The fountain\\'s wall boundary is shaped in the form of a regular octagon and built so that one of the vertices of the octagon points towards the historic Ponce City Hall. The fountain also features four lion statues and water that flows under colored lighting effects. The four lion statues are located one statue on each alternating vertex of the fountain\\'s octagonal boundary wall.\\n\nIn 1878 the spot now occupied by Fuente de los Leones was occupied by a monument to the Spanish Constitution of 1812 .  It had been erected under the direction of 1812 mayor of Ponce Jose Ortiz de la Renta , ca. 1820, but was removed in the 1870s by Carlist mayor and Spanish military officer Elicio Berriz . [ note 1 ] In 1882, the location was then occupied by \"Arab kiosk\" (a.k.a., \"Kiosko La Alhambra\"  ) built in 1882 for the 1882 Ponce Fair. The kiosk was demolished in 1914.  The current (2022) fountain was purchased in 1939 at the New York World\\'s Fair .  [ note 2 ] When originally installed, it was adorned with baby angel sculptures, but in the early 1940s the baby angels were replaced with the current (2022) lions. The lions were sculptured in 1940 by Victor Cott, a sculptor from Juana Diaz , during the mayoral administration of mayor Andrés Grillasca Salas .  The fountain, including a mechanical basement, was remodeled and restored in 1993. Its base was enlarged and a computerized lighting system was installed.  \\n\nThe fountain was the inspiration for a poem published in 2002,  that reads,\\n\nThis plaza also features a statue of native composer Juan Morel Campos . This statue was produced at the workshop of Italian sculptor Luiggi Tomassi.  \\n\nAlso in this plaza is an obelisk in honor of the firefighters who fought the \"El Polvorín\" fire (see Parque de Bombas ). The obelisk was unveiled in 1948, in time for the 50th anniversary of the frightful fire.  \\n\nIn the northwest side of the plaza and facing northwest, there is also a statue, called Blind Justice , of a woman in a long dress with her eyes covered by a cloth wrapped around the top of her head. The woman\\'s left hand holds a sword that sits inside a shaft which rests on the ground, and there are two children sitting happily by her feet: one is embracing the lower part of the sword\\'s shaft and the other child is playing with an orange tree branch. Blind Justice sits on the northwest area of the plaza and faces northwest.\\n\nA second statue, Maternity, sits on the plaza as well. This one consists of a woman sitting down and sitting two small children on her lap, one child sits on her left leg and the other one on her right leg, while the children lean against her chest. Maternity sits on the southwest side of the plaza and faces southwest. These two statues were designed by Victor Cott, a sculptor from Juana Diaz who also designed the four lions at Fuente de los Leones , Esclavo libertado and La Labradora .\\n\nLa Labradora is a third statue that used to be located on Plaza Degetau, on the southeast section of the plaza, facing southeast, but today (2018) adorns Parque Graciela Rivera . La Labradora, together with a fourth sculpture yet called El Cuerno de la Abundancia ( The Horn of Abundance ), were moved out of the plaza in the late 1940s to make room for the Monumento a los heroes de El Polvorín (1948) and the statue of Juan Morel Campos (~1950), respectively. El Cuerno de la Abundancia was located on the northeast section of the plaza and faced northeast but, in the late 1940s, was relocated to elsewhere in the city of Ponce; unfortunately, it was vandalized at the new location and was lost.  The placing of the statues as well as the relocation of the last two statues, occurred during the 16-year mayoral administration of Andrés Grillasca Salas in the 1940s-1950s.\\n\nSetting\nPlaza Degetau is bounded on the north by the Our Lady of Guadalupe Cathedral and the historic Parque de Bombas firehouse, on the south by Plaza Degetau street (also called Villa street and Comercio street), on the west by Union street, and on the east by Marina street. It is surrounded by two hotels, the Ponce City Hall , two historic banks ( Banco de Ponce and Banco Crédito ), a long-standing ice cream parlor called \" King\\'s Ice Cream \", and various boutiques and cafes.  \\n\nThe plaza has wide mosaic-tile sidewalks, well-manicured flower gardens, well-trimmed bushes and Indian laurel trees, late 1800s lamposts, and numerous marble benches. It is home to the Lions Fountain, \"one of the most beautiful fountains in Puerto Rico.\"  The fountain is made of marble and bronze. During the day, the plaza hustles with schoolchildren, shoppers, and tourists. After the sun sets, there are oftentimes live bands giving concerts to \"multigenerational families.\"  \\n\nGallery\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza del Caribe\n\\n\nPlaza del Caribe is an enclosed shopping mall located in Ponce , Puerto Rico . It is owned by Empresas Fonalledas, and is the largest mall in southern Puerto Rico.  The mall is located at the intersection of Puerto Rico Highway 2 and Highway 12 . The anchor stores are JCPenney and Macy\\'s . A former third anchor store, Sears , closed in February 2020.  \\n\nHistory\nOn December 28, 1969, the Kislak Organization advertised the development of a new 600,000 square feet (56,000 m 2 ) regional enclosed mall named \"Plaza del Caribe\" in Ponce.  \\n\nOn November 6, 1971, J. C. Penney Co. Inc. , one of America\\'s largest retail chains at the time, was to open its second major department store in Puerto Rico by November 1973. The J. I. Kislak Realty Corp. of Newark, New Jersey , and San Juan , had announced that negotiations had been concluded for a two-story,174,400-square-foot (16,200 m 2 ) department store to be built for Penney\\'s occupancy in Plaza Del Caribe, a regional shopping center that was rising on a 62-acre (25 ha) tract on Exterior Avenue in Ponce. Plaza Del Caribe, an enclosed, all-weather mall complex was scheduled to comprise more than 500,000 square feet of stores with parking provided for 3,600 cars in its initial stage. Provisions were being made for expansion, and the center was expected to reach 725,000 square feet of stores in its final stage. The center was being developed by Sabari Estates, Inc., headed by Jose Sauri Jr. of Ponce. Architects for the project were Passalacqua & Cia. Development consultant and exclusive leasing broker for Plaza Del Caribe was the J. I. Kislak Realty Corp. which maintained a Caribbean regional office in San Juan . The same broker was an exclusive leasing agent for the Plaza Las Américas in San Juan, the first regional shopping center in Latin America.  \\n\nOn May 21, 1972, it was reported that construction of the shopping center would begin work on July 1 of that year. The center was expected to have 680,000 square feet and 60 stores at the time, with a completion date set for 1974.  \\n\nOn June 25, 1975, it was announced that Plaza del Caribe, projected to cost $25 million, would begin construction in Ponce next September that year. This was reported by the firms Sabari Estates and Kislak Realty Corporation, developer and broker of the project, respectively. Final approval for the channeling of the Río Portugués, which served as the border for the new shopping center, had been granted by the Department of Transportation and Public Works and by the Army Corps of Engineers, which, according to the firms, paved the way at the time for the start of construction of the project. The Kislak organization reported that it had already signed lease agreements with Pueblo Supermarkets , J.C. Penney , F.W. Woolworth , Gordon\\'s Jewelers , González Padín , Thom McAn and Kinney Shoes stores, which would occupy premises in the shopping center. Kislak Realty president Joseph Aramanda said Plaza del Caribe was expected to provide 2,000 jobs when completed.  \\n\nOn April 15, 1976, it was reported that Plaza del Caribe Shopping Center was about to begin construction. An executive with J.I. Kislak Realty Corp., the exclusive leasing agents at the time for Plaza del Caribe, said the mall would have approximately 85 stores. Located on the Ponce highway, Plaza del Caribe would have nearly 700,000 square feet (65,000 m 2 ) of commercial space and service areas. It was to be located on about 65 acres of land. The developer of the Shopping Center was Sabari Estates, from Ponce, whose president was Dr. Francisco Sánchez Arán. Atilio Zepeda, from the Kislak Realty Corporation for the Caribbean, said that among the most important department stores that had signed a lease for the mall was J. C. Penney . \"This will be the largest mall ever built outside of the San Juan area, and we expect to have a large number of major department stores as well as other well known stores when Plaza del Caribe opens. We are currently signing new tenants,\" Zepeda said.  \\n\nOn June 30, 1990, it was reported that one of the most modern and complete shopping centers in the southern area of the Island, would serve more than 470,000 consumers in the municipalities of the region. The project was under construction on a 70-acre property on highway number 2 in Ponce and represented an investment of over $50 million. \"The city of Ponce is now experiencing a renewed effervescence. We feel very proud to share in their enthusiasm and to contribute, through Plaza del Caribe, to the economic development of Ponce, as well as the entire southern area,\" said Jaime Fonalledas , son, president of the Board of the center. Fonalledas added that even with two years to go before the opening of the center, there was already a palpable interest on the part of the business community. He reported that preliminary agreements had been reached with the main department store chains for their participation in Plaza del Caribe. The businessman also highlighted that considerations have been taken in the architectural design of the center so that it contributed to the cultural richness of Ponce and complemented the city\\'s tourist offerings.  \\n\nOn November 9, 1992, Plaza del Caribe, opened its doors to the public, and was already in the process of starting a third phase of construction. It was not disclosed what types of stores or businesses would be located in the three planned buildings, the largest of which would be 400,870 square feet. The remaining two would be 60,000 and 44,000 square feet, respectively. The projected cost of the new investment in Plaza del Caribe was also unclear. The two initial phases, the first of which began in April 1989, required an investment of $74 million. At the time, 1,500 to 2,000 jobs had been created. The three buildings would be built under the concept of a \" power center \". Something similar to this type of concept was the Toys \"R\" Us store in Plaza Las Américas at the time. Plaza del Caribe, whose main tenants were Sears , JCPenney and González Padín , opened to the public with 32 stores already ready, representing 66 percent of stores or 84 percent of leased space. It was expected that by December of that year, 87 percent of them would be open, which meant that 90 percent of the space would already be rented. In total, Plaza del Caribe would have 118 stores, including the three main anchor stores, food outlets, movie theaters and stores such as Kinney Shoes , Oak Tree, Foot Locker and LensCrafters . This mix of establishments was made to follow the tastes of consumers who preferred clothing and shoe stores. They were followed in importance by service establishments; entertainment, music, and home goods stores; and then those of gifts and jewelry.  \\n\nIn July 2003, Plaza del Caribe would have establishments such as Gap , Old Navy , Tiendas Capri, 5-7-9 , Claire\\'s , Champs Sports , Foot Locker , KB Toys , Electronics Boutique , Radio Shack , Rave, Naturalizer, Regis Hairstylists , Time Out, Zales Jewelers , and others.  \\n\nOn January 6, 2007, It was reported that Circuit City would be opening a store in Plaza del Caribe. The approximately 20,000 square foot store was expected to open by 2008.  \\n\nDuring the 2010 Christmas holiday season, the in-mall 6-screen cinema was replaced by a new 10-screen Caribbean Cinemas multiplex located on mall property but physically detached from the main mall structure. It is located immediately south of the main mall complex bounded by Autopista Luis A. Ferre (PR-52) .\\n\nOn April 15, 2012, CompUSA announced the grand opening of its second branch in Puerto Rico . The 30,000 square foot store incorporated a total consumer shopping experience through its \"Retail 2.0\" system. This system combined the best of shopping through traditional stores and online. A grand opening ceremony would be held on April 27, 2012.  The store under the nameplate at the time of TigerDirect would close by June 30, 2015.  \\n\nOn July 20, 2012, it was announced that Plaza del Caribe would soon begin a $3.5 million remodeling and expansion of its Terraza del Caribe food court and the construction of the second Zara store in Puerto Rico . The Zara store would be located in the space previously occupied by the original location of Caribbean Cinemas , and was expected to open at the end of that year. Upon completion, the food court would have some 10,500 square feet of new space and its new design would be \"modern, bright, with open spaces, and will feature spaces for larger groups of people and counter tables, in addition to the traditional food court tables,\" mall officials said. \"This year, when we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Plaza Del Caribe, we begin our preparations for the next 20 years of commitment and service to the market that has welcomed and supported us,\" said Arturo Valldejuly, general manager at the time of Plaza Del Caribe. \"We now start the complete renovation and expansion of the food court, where we will be changing the floor, acoustic ceilings, furniture, facades of the eateries and the lighting of the area,\" said Valldejuly, adding that although the construction work would begin then, it would be coordinated in a way that did not disrupt the everyday operation of the shopping center. It was expected that the project would be completed during the first half of that following year. Part of the food court project included relocating the mall\\'s emblematic \"Venus\" sculpture from the base of the central atrium stairs. where it had been located for two decades at the time to the center of the food court.  \\n\nOn May 13, 2013, a P. F. Chang\\'s restaurant would open at the mall, the 7,400 square foot structure had a capacity for 268 patrons.  \\n\nOn May 31, 2013, twelve years after making its local debut, retailer Macy\\'s , announced planned to open a new store in Ponce, in the fall of 2015. The two-level, 150,000 square-foot store would be located in Plaza del Caribe, owned by Empresas Fonalledas . Macy\\'s Ponce store would include an assortment of fashion goods for women, men, children and home that would be \"tailored to the preferences of the Puerto Rican customer,\" store officials said. Construction was expected to begin in 2014. Macy\\'s store was expected to employ a workforce of approximately 275 associates. The investment required to build the new store was not revealed.  \\n\nIn October 2013, Sports Authority , one of the largest sporting goods retailers at the time in the mainland, marked its entrance into the Puerto Rican market with the grand opening of its flagship store in Ponce. The sporting goods store, located in Plaza del Caribe, boasted 35,000 square feet of retail space and featured a wide assortment of quality sporting goods.  The store would be announced to close in 2016 due to the bankruptcy of the chain.  \\n\nOn January 24, 2014, it was announced that after more than 20 years of being founded, the Plaza del Caribe shopping center, in Ponce, would be carrying out its first expansion, in which it would add a two-story building and more than 200,000 square feet of commercial space, at a cost of more than $30 million. The expansion, had not gone without controversy due to the removal of more than 300 trees on the land where the buildings will be built. The mall would have Macy\\'s as its new anchor. This would be the second store that the chain would open on the island, the first one had opened in the year 2000 in Plaza Las Américas . In an exclusive interview with Jaime Fonalledas, owner of Plaza del Caribe, he indicated that the construction would start during the third quarter of this year, and was expected to be completed by the end of 2015. It would be carried out in the southern area of the mall, in front of where the Sports Authority and CompUSA stores were. The expansion would consist of a new two-story, 57,000 square foot building, connecting the existing mall building with the new Macy\\'s anchor store. This addition would be made on the south side, next to Banco Popular on the first level and Loft on the second. Said building would accommodate a total of between 15 and 18 commercial establishments, and on its roof it would feature a large skylight that would allow sunlight to enter and give the two levels a lot of clarity. The Macy\\'s store would have two levels and 150,000 square feet. With the expansion, more than 400 additional parking spaces would be built. \"Plaza del Caribe has been successful from day one. Macy\\'s was interested in opening a second store in Puerto Rico, and many merchants have confidence in the trajectory of this mall. Imagine, without announcing much, new tenants have arrived,\" Fonalledas commented when asked why he decided to expand the shopping center at this time. Among those tenants who had opted for Plaza del Caribe, he mentioned Sports Authority , Zara , Forever 21 , Express , PF Chang\\'s , Longhorn , and Pandora , in addition to Macy\\'s .  \\n\nOn October 22, 2015, it was reported that Plaza del Caribe had been the subject of a significant overhaul that included the construction of a new building featuring Puerto Rico\\'s second ever Macy\\'s department store, being scheduled to open on November 5 of that year. The expansion project, which entailed an investment of around $40 million also added about 60,000 square feet of space to the original mall structure, which in turn allowed the inclusion of about 18 new stores to the Ponce shopping center. Some of the retail tenants that had  recently opened or were slated to open during those next few weeks included Victoria\\'s Secret , Bath & Body Works , House of Hoops by Foot Locker and Starbucks .  The expansion project at the mall, which had begun its most intense stage two years earlier, also involved constructing a structure connecting the Macy\\'s building to the rest of the mall, as well as replacing the mall\\'s floor and roof elements, furniture and décor.The shopping center\\'s redesigned look resembled that of certain areas of Plaza Las Américas , particularly the hallways between anchor stores Macy\\'s and JC Penney\\'s .  \\n\nOn November 5, 2015, the mall would officially inaugurate its new renovations, which also included the opening of the Macy\\'s store.  \\n\nOn November 7, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing this location a part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide. The store would close by February 2020.  \\n\nMall design\nPlaza del Caribe is notable for its sophisticated design, featuring artwork scattered throughout the mall, especially in its central atrium . Exterior entrances provide access to both its first and second floors.\\n\nCurrent anchors\nFormer anchors\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza del Mercado de Ponce\n\\n\nPlaza del Mercado de Ponce (English: Ponce Market Plaza) or, formally, Plaza del Mercado Isabel Segunda (often abbreviated as Plaza del Mercado Isabel II ), is a historic marketplace building in Ponce, Puerto Rico . It was inaugurated in 1863 by Ponce Mayor Don Luis de Quixano . Designed by famed engineer Timoteo Luberza ,  it occupies a city block in the Ponce Historic Zone at the grid formed by Calle Atocha, Estrella, Leon, and Castillo streets.  It has room for 65 kiosks.  It was originally called Plaza del Capá.  \\n\nHistory\nThe building was erected from plans by Timoteo Luberza in 1863, who modeled it after Les Halles , the market of Paris in France. At the time it was built, it was the largest and most modern marketplace in Puerto Rico.  It has undergone four major additions and/or remodelings since then: in 1903, 1941, 1980-89, and 2006.  \\n\nIn 1903 it was enlarged according to the Neoclassical design of architect Manuel V. Domenech .   A meat storage was also added.  Even by the early 1900s, Plaza del Mercado had enjoyed many years of heavy use and, by 1926, Plaza del Mercado Isabel II was so overcrowded that the city of Ponce built a second plaza, Mercado de las Carnes (\"Meat Market\"), to relieve the overcrowding at Plaza del Mercado.  \\n\nIn 1941, it was again enlarged per plans by Ponce-born architect Pedro Mendez Mercado .   During the 1941 remodeling, the original structure, which was not art deco , was enhanced with an art deco facade.  \\n\nStarting in 1981, and for the next 26 years, Plaza del Mercado shopkeepers operated out of a new building at the grid formed by Calle Guadalupe, Salud, Estrella and Mayor streets, two blocks east of the historic Plaza del Mercado Isabel II. The new building, called the Plaza del Mercado Juan Bigas building, was inaugurated in 1981 to replace the aging, but historic, Plaza del Mercado Isabel II building.  It cost $10 million to build. It is the building with the largest footprint in Ponce. Inside of it are some of the ruins of the old Teatro Apolo.  (Teatro Apolo was located at the corner of Calle Salud and Calle Guadalupe.  ) On 28 June 2010, Governor Luis Fortuño signed the Senate Resolution Number 191, transferring ownership of the Plaza del Mercado de Ponce Juan Bigas building to the Ponce Municipal Government.  The Juan Bigas building had sat unused since the 1990s when the shopkeepers moved back to the remodeled Isabel II building. On 7 April 2011, the municipal government announced it would invest $10 million to remodel the Juan Bigas building and turn it into a municipal services center, dubbed \" Ponce Servicios \", hosting various municipal services offices.  The remodeling of the old Plaza del Mercado Juan Bigas building to be used for municipal government services will occur at a cost of $6.828 million.  A 27 July 2011, news report stated work on the Bigas building would commence in October 2011 at an expected cost of $15 million.  A 26 June 2013 news report indicated that renovations had been completed and the first two floor of the facility would reopen by the end of July 2013. The agencies due to occupy the structure are: the Oficina de Permisos (Office of Permits), Ordenación Territorial (Office of Territorial Planning), Vivienda Municipal (Office of Municipal Housing), the Archivo Histórico de Ponce , Office of the Federal Ryan White Program and the Banco Municipal (Municipal Bank). The name of the facility is Ponce Servicios.  The facility reopened as \"Ponce Servicios\" in August 2013.  \\n\nIn 1980, the building was once more remodeled. The 1980 remodeling lasted 9 years - until 1989.  Its Art Deco style was further enhanced, after the design of architect Pedro Méndez Mercado. At this point the structure was turned from a fruits-and-vegetables market plaza into a handcrafts shopping plaza.   Air conditioning was added to Plaza del Mercado Isabel II in 1984 when the Pitusa supermarket moved in.  \\n\nIn 1992 Plaza del Mercado Isabell II was turned into a multi-use building that included parking, businesses, and private office space. This 1992 reconstruction was part of the Ponce en Marcha project.  It was designed by architect Miguel A. Carlos and built by Vissepo Construction. In 1993 the design and building project received the Award for Building Excellence of the Puerto Rico Association of General Contractors and the Association of Pre-mixed Concrete Manufacturers.  \\n\nThe building was restored once more in 2006 at a cost of $4 million.  In August 2007, the Juan Bigas Building shopkeepers moved back to the historic Plaza del Mercado Isabel II building to occupy it once more as a fruit-and-vegetables market place.   \\n\nUniqueness\n\"The phenomenon of this building, unique in Puerto Rico, is that despite its enlargements, its interior still preserves the original structure. Through its remodelings, its facade has shown several architectural styles, including neoclassical and art deco.\"  \\n\nToday\nToday Plaza de Mercado is also used as a venue for a variety of festivals and other similar gatherings.  However, in October 2010, structural and air conditioning problems were found with the newly rebuilt structure.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza del Norte\n\\n\nPlaza del Norte is a 698,581 sq ft (64,900.3 m 2 )  shopping center located in Hatillo, Puerto Rico currently owned and managed by Curzon Puerto Rico. It is the largest shopping center in northwestern Puerto Rico , with over 130 stores and fast food restaurants.\\n\nHistory\nOn May 14, 1991, the placement of the first stone was celebrated beginning construction on the Plaza del Norte shopping mall.  \\nIn Spring 1992, being developed my HT Ventures, SE, Plaza del Norte inaugurated to much fanfare, featuring three main anchors, a 61,880 square-foot JCPenney , a 90,000 square-foot Sears ,  and a 110,580 square-foot Walmart store which was expected to create approximately 240 jobs for area residents. Due to success, it would later on receive renovations in 1995.   \\n\nIn December 2002, Plaza del Norte attracted visitors from all over the Island with its unique architectural design, traditional fountain, and its mix of shops in its L-shaped design. Sears, JCPenney, Walmart, and Pueblo Xtra were all the perfect combination to attract customers and were excellently complemented by over 120 other stores such as Pitusa , Bakers Shoes , Blockbuster , Contempo Casuals , Footaction , GNC , Gordon's Jewelers , Kay Bee Toys , Journeys , Kress , Pacific Sunwear , Payless Shoe Source , Radio Shack , The Disney Store , Toys R Us , and many others.   \\n\nOn August 5, 2004, it was reported that PMI Inc., owners of Plaza del Norte at the time, had pumped $250,000 into an institutional advertising campaign for the shopping mall. Designed by Sajo Garcia & Partners, it had kicked off in July of that year and would run for two years. With the title Revista (magazine), the campaign was opened by a television spot whose concept would be tailored later on to each shopping season. It would include print and radio ads, billboards, and banners inside the mall.  A women\\'s magazine appeared in the ads highlighting the fashionable products and clothes that were available at Plaza del Norte. To further promote its stores, the magazine gave tips on the latest trends in fashion and advertised where those products can be found. According to Raquel Matias, marketing director of Plaza del Norte, the campaign\\'s target market was modern, professional, active, and cheerful women who were ever fashion-con-scious. \"The participation of our retailers was vital [for the campaign\\'s production],\" said Matias, \"since all clothes, footwear, and accessories used were provided by store owners and managers.\"  Plaza del Norte was managed by PMI. Its 670,000 square foot property was home to J.C.Penney , Sears , Wal-Mart , Pueblo Supermarkets , Cine Vista Theaters , and others. Sales per square foot averaged $420 a year while food court sales per square foot averaged $1,020 a year.  \\n\nIn 2005, the mall was acquired by DDR Corp. from a $1.15 billion portfolio deal with Caribbean Property Group (CPG) which included the mall.  \\n\nIn May 2006, the mall anchored by Walmart , JCPenney , Pueblo Supermarket , Sears , and a CineVista Theatres was the dominant shopping center in the trade area due to its size and prominent location. The tenant mix within the balance of the shopping center featured a food court, restaurants, and a selection of specialty stores including The Gap , 5-7-9 , Foot Locker , Kids Foot Locker , Lady Foot Locker , Champs Sports , Zales , Rave, and Motherhood Maternity , which combined to generate very strong sales per square foot.  \\n\nOn January 11, 2007, it was reported that the clothing store Gap would be leaving Plaza del Norte on January 26 of that month after another disappointing year for the fashion retail giant, which was widely rumored to be on the verge of being sold at the time. This left seven remaining Gap stores in Puerto Rico in addition to Gap Inc. stable mates Banana Republic and Old Navy , with two and five stores respectively. In addition, Gap Inc. would continue to operate three Gap and one Banana Republic outlets on the island.  \\n\nOn March 1, 2007, it was reported that CV Entertainment Group had shut down its 6-screen CineVista Theatres multiplex in Hatillo\\'s Plaza del Norte, one of several high-profile tenants that exited or were about to leave the shopping center owned by stateside Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Developers Diversified Realty (DDR) at the time. In addition to the previously reported closing of Gap , sources said 1-2-3 and Infinito, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection along with sister stores Geraldine, Jackie\\'s, Ranger and Fashion Bazaar, were also leaving one of Puerto Rico\\'s largest malls. On the bright side, sources say Marshalls would soon replace the vacant Pitusa , another casualty at Plaza del Norte. According to DDR\\'s website, 61,874 square feet, almost 10%, of the mall was now vacant. Sources said rent and common area maintenance charges soared at DDR-owned malls since the REIT purchased 15 Puerto Rico malls for US$1.15 billion in late 2004.  \\n\nIn November 2008, Circuit City would open a store at Plaza del Norte, this being right on the heels of its bankruptcy at the time. The store would last until 2009, when the remaining three Circuit City stores including this one would ultimately close.  \\n\nIn February 2010, the mall was now additionally anchored by an OfficeMax . It also had other stores such as Aeropostale , Aldo, Gordon\\'s Jewelers , Foot Locker , La Gran Via, Kress, Marianne/Marianne Plus, Pacific Sunwear , Payless ShoeSource , RadioShack , Sunglass Hut , The Children\\'s Place , The Room, and Traffic Shoes, which all combined to generate very strong sales results.  \\n\nIn 2011, a TJ Maxx store opened at the mall.  \\n\nIn 2011, DDR Corp. announced a significant interior and exterior renovation of the mall, including a 10,000-square-foot expansion and renovation of the existing JCPenney store, which now occupies part of the JCPenney wing, including the former Circuit City , which closed in 2009. The project included the addition of a Rooms To Go , the combination of three small retail-space units to accommodate a PetSmart , several other new stores and outparcels, a new Caribbean Cinemas movie theater and new carts and kiosks through the entire mall. The project was completed in mid-2013.   \\n\nIn early October 2015, Walmart left the mall for a Supercenter.  \\n\nIn 2017, the DDR Corp. would spin off its Puerto Rican shopping centers to RVI ( Retail Value Inc. ) due to struggles they had after the Hurricane Maria , making Retail Value Inc. the new owner of the mall at the time.  \\n\nIn November 2019, with an investment that exceeded $3 million, the first Econo supermarket in the municipality of Hatillo was opened at Plaza del Norte in the majority of the space of the former Walmart store.  \\n\nOn October 30, 2020, a new Burlington Coat Factory store opened in the remaining space of the former Walmart , opening into the mall with an interior entrance.  \\n\nIn February 2021, it was announced that the Sears store at Plaza del Norte would begin liquidation sales and it would be closing by April of that year.  \\n\nIn August 2021 Developers Diversified ( DDR Corp. ) came back to the PR retail landscape with a $550 million deal with RVI which Plaza del Norte was included in, making DDR the owner of the mall once again.  \\n\nIn 2023, a Chick Fil-A would open in the mall premises alongside an O\\'Reilly Auto Parts .   \\n\nOn May 10, 2023, it was reported that Curzon Puerto Rico, an affiliate of Curzon Advisers, was now the owner of one of the largest shopping center portfolios in Puerto Rico, formerly owned by Developers Diversified ( DDR Corp. ) which had acquired it again in 2021. In this portfolio of 9 shopping centers, Plaza del Norte was included, making Curzon Puerto Rico the new owners of the mall.  \\n\nCurrent anchors\nFormer anchors\nFormer stores\nGallery\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza del Quinto Centenario\nPlaza del Quinto Centenario ( Spanish for \\'Square of the Fifth Centenary\\'), also Plaza del V Centenario , popularly referred to as Plaza del Tótem (\\'Totem Square\\'), is a modern square in Old San Juan , Puerto Rico, inaugurated in 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the European discovery and Spanish conquest of Puerto Rico and the Americas and the first European settlement of San Juan. The square is located between the Ballajá and Mercado neighborhoods of the San Juan Antiguo barrio of San Juan, Puerto Rico . It is located next to the Ballajá Barracks , the Puerto Rican National Gallery and the San José Church , close to El Morro and the San Juan National Historic Site .\\n\nHistory\nAt the time of the Spanish settlement of San Juan, the site of the Plaza del Quinto Centenario originally belonged to the Catholic Dominican Order , which established a monastery during the 16th century. The main structure of the monastery still stands today, and it serves as the headquarters of the National Gallery operated by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture . Throughout the 19th century, the lot was owned by the Spanish Army , which established the Ballajá Barracks , and later during the first half of the 20th century it was home to the US Army \\'s Fort Brooke. The site and its surrounding buildings were abandoned during the second half of the 20th century, and by the late 1960s the entire area was in a rapid state of urban decay . After the institution of the San Juan National Historic Site as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and in an attempt to revitalize the area in 1986, the Puerto Rico State Office of Historic Preservation began a series of projects aimed at restoring the historic heritage of the neighborhood and reviving the economic, cultural and tourism industries in the area.  \\n\nAs its current name describes, the modern square was built and finished in 1992 in time for the celebration of the 5th centenary (500th anniversary) of the European discovery of Puerto Rico and the Americas, during a period of extensive renovation and redevelopment of the Ballajá neighborhood along other important historic sites in Old San Juan. The square hosted a series of cultural programs including traditional arts and crafts, cultural performances and a carnival. It also hosted the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra , and a celebratory concert honoring Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández Marín , and other important figures of the cultural history of Puerto Rico. Some of the musical performers included Rocío Jurado , José Feliciano , Celia Cruz , Ruth Fernandez , Ednita Nazario and Danny Rivera .  \\n\nThe Plaza del Quinto Centenario today is one of the main staging locations for the annual San Sebastián Street Festival during the month of January.  The square was also the site for the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the official founding of the city of San Juan on September 12 of 2022, officiated by Mayor Miguel Romero Lugo .  \\n\nDescription\nThe main feature of the square is the \\'Teluric Totem\\' ( Tótem Telúrico ), which lends its name to the Plaza del Tótem (\\'Totem Square\\'), the name popularly and locally used for the Plaza del Quinto Centenario. The \"totem\" is actually an art sculpture created by Puerto Rican ceramist Jaime Suárez, and it is made from broken fragments of ceramic vases and other types of clay pottery from the Americas,  which allude to the pottery fragments of the indigenous Taino found in archaeological sites throughout Puerto Rico. As such, this sculpture represents the historic but violent first meeting between the original native inhabitants of Puerto Rico and the European colonizers.  The totem has a base or pedestal built from black granite, and the entire sculpture rises to 40 feet (12 m) in height. The square at the base of the totem portrays a wind rose pointing at the cardinal directions. A similar sculpture by the same artist can be found in front of the Federico Degetau Federal Building in Hato Rey .  \\n\nThe square is bound by sculptures representing the Agnus Dei , and the Lamb of God , one of the symbols of San Juan and the main feature of the escutcheon of the coat of arms of Puerto Rico . The art designs and steps setup, and their arrangement in the square, represent the 500-year history period of the history of Puerto Rico since the European settlement in 1492, and each level of the square represents a centennial or 100 years in the history of the island. The southern end of the square is also marked by needle-shaped columns which point towards the North Star .  The Plaza del Quinto Centenario is bound by Norzagaray Street to the north, del Cristo Street to the east, Dr. Francisco Rufino de Goenaga Street to the south, and Morovis Street to the west, and it hosts an extensive parking garage underground.   \\n\nGallery\nReferences\n18°28\\xe2\\x80\\xb205\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°07\\xe2\\x80\\xb209\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.46794°N 66.11905°W ﻿ / 18.46794; -66.11905 \\n"

The mall was opened in 1998; it was later acquired in 2005 by DDR Corp. out of a $1.15 billion portfolio deal with Caribbean Property Group (CPG), which included the mall.  And is now owned by Curzon Puerto Rico. \\n\nHistory\nIn 1998, developed as a joint venture between BY Ventures, SE, and Walmart ,  Plaza del Sol would open with more than 50 stores to much fanfare including a 16,000 square foot Group Usa, a 16,000 square foot Old Navy , a 20,000 square foot Pep Boys , and a 9,000 square foot Mikasa store.

One thing that helped was the opening of El Meson Express . During its first month, the eatery registered sales of $100,000; that\\'s a record-breaker,\" said Castro. \"Overall, food court sales in August were 5.7% higher than in the same month in 2002.\" She noted that average sales per square foot at the food court were $1,074. \"These sales are a good indicator of how much traffic we receive,\" said Castro.

The mall\\'s movie theater had reported 20.2% higher sales over August 2002. \"In June they increased 23.8%,\" said Castro. She attributed the sales gain to the blockbuster movies launched during summer. Castro said Walmart , among the first to open at Plaza del Sol in 1998, reported that sales had increased 7% or $4 million from 2001 to 2002. The shopping center\\'s overall sales in August had jumped 1% over the same month that past year. \"Average sales per square foot are $508,\" said Castro.  \\n\nIn April 2004, it was reported that Johnny Rockets of Puerto Rico Inc, the at the time new local franchisee of retro-style restaurant chain Johnny Rockets , was opening an eatery in Bayamon\\'s Plaza del Sol that week, the first of three it planned for the island in 10 years.  \"We will have a soft opening April 23 from 3:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m., said Craig Doyle, then operations manager of Johnny Rockets of Puerto Rico.

Doyle said the soft opening would also help management pick which employees will be shift leaders and certified training managers.  \\n\nIn August 2004, it was reported that Plaza del Sol would begin construction on a multistory parking lot, it would be adding 400 parking spaces to the 3,400 the mall already had. Two hundred of the 400 new spaces were expected to be ready by Christmas of that year.  \\n\nIn November 2004, it was reported that Developers Diversified Realty (DDR) had announced it had entered into an agreement to purchase 15 Puerto Rican retail real estate assets, totaling nearly 5.0 million square feet from Caribbean Property Group, LLC (\"CPG\"). The transaction had a total value of approximately $1.15 billion, which represented a 7.4% cap rate on a pro-forma basis without the benefit of straight-line rents. The transaction was expected to close during the first quarter of 2005, subject to the company\\'s due diligence and standard closing conditions. This transaction included Plaza del Sol, which was one of the many shopping centers acquired by DDR through the deal, making DDR owners of the shopping mall. The deal would officially be completed on January 27, 2005.   \\n\nIn January 2005, it was reported that after years of eyeing the local market, electronics mega retailer Best Buy had finally decided to open shop on the island. The first store would be located at Bayamon\\'s Plaza del Sol. About nine more stores were planned to open later.  Best Buy\\'s store in Plaza del Sol would be located right above the mall\\'s 30,000 square foot Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB) box and would have more than 65 employees. This is in line with the plans the shopping mall\\'s new owner at the time, Ohio-based Developers Diversified Realty (DDR), had reported. DDR said it could expand the mall vertically instead of horizontally to increase its value, as space to grow was limited.  Besides adding a second story to BBB to house Best Buy, sources close to the mall said that up to three additional stories could be added to Plaza del Sol to provide more retail space. \"Ever since it was first built, Plaza del Sol was designed with aggressive expansion in mind,\" said the source. In fact, before the sale to DDR, Plaza del Sol had already said it planned to add a multistory parking lot. The construction of Best Buy in Plaza del Sol was part of the retailer\\'s 2005 plans to invest $700 million in property and equipment, and to open some 73 stores nationwide and in Canada.  \\n\nIn 2017, DDR Corp. spun off its Puerto Rican shopping centers to RVI ( Retail Value Inc. ) due to struggles they had after the Hurricane Maria , making Retail Value Inc. the new owner of the mall at the time.  \\n\nIn August 2021, Developers Diversified ( DDR Corp. ) came back to the PR retail landscape with a $550 million deal with RVI which Plaza del Sol was included in, making DDR the owner of the mall once again.  \\n\nIn September 2022, it was announced that Bed Bath & Beyond would be closing as part of a plan to close 150 stores nationwide.  \\n\nOn May 10, 2023, it was reported that Curzon Puerto Rico, an affiliate of Curzon Advisers, was now the owner of one of the largest shopping center portfolios in Puerto Rico, formerly owned by Developers Diversified ( DDR Corp. ) which had acquired it again in 2021. In this portfolio of 9 shopping centers, Plaza del Sol was included, making Curzon Puerto Rico the new owners of the mall.  \\n\nOn February 6, 2024, it was reported that Burlington would be replacing the space left by Bed Bath & Beyond at the mall, a store opening for the Burlington was scheduled for May 17.  \\n\nAnchor Stores\nFormer Anchor Stores\nRenovations\nIn 2011, after the acquisition from DDR Corp. It was announced that during the next six years they would be redeveloping the mall to add more retail space and also to change the design it was given since it was first built. The mall added 35,500 sq ft (3,300 m 2 ), moving the food court upstairs and reusing the space below for new tenants.  Phase two of Plaza Del Sol\\'s redevelopment will include more parking spaces and the construction of approximately 137,000 square feet (12,700 m 2 ) of new GLA to accommodate the expansion of a key anchor as well as construction of additional junior anchor boxes.  \\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza de San José\n\\n\nSt. Joseph\\'s Square ( Plaza de San José in Spanish) is a 19th century square located in the centre of the city of Pontevedra ( Spain ), in the first urban expansion area, near the Campolongo neighbourhood.\\n\nOrigin of the name\nThe square is named after the demolished St. Joseph\\'s Chapel on the southeast side of the square.  \\n\nHistory\nThe square was formed at the end of the 19th century at the junction of the streets Marquis of Riestra , Oliva and Augusto González Besada. It is located in the former St. Joseph\\'s Field, which owes its name to the chapel, now disappeared,  which was located on the site currently occupied by the Pontevedra Savings Bank building . In the first half of the 19th century, in the St. Joseph\\'s Field there was an oak grove that formed alleys under the shade of which a livestock fair was held (cattle, pigs, horses and sheep) on the first and fifteenth of each month.  \\n\nThe Baroque Chapel of St. Joseph was built in 1712. It was a medium-sized building whose fa\\xc3 7ade featured the image of St. Joseph in a niche in the upper part of a circular pediment above which were the coats of arms of the Gago and Montenegro families, among others. Its construction is attributed to Pablo Payo Gago de Mendoza y Sotomayor. Important weddings and funerals were celebrated here. It was demolished in the early 1940s because it interfered with the urban development of the city centre.  \\n\nThe square was also the site of the Baroque pazo of the Gago de Mendoza and Montenegro families, which dates from the 15th century.  The pazo was on the north side of the square, and its centre was located on the site now occupied by the Café Moderno .  Part of the structure remains to the left of the pazo house at the beginning of Oliva Street . In the 1980s, a new floor was added and the original battlements were moved to the top. It had a central tower of three storeys and two lateral towers of two floors with pointed battlements in the centre of which were six-pointed stars inscribed in a circle. The area that is now the square was used centuries ago as the pazo\\'s parade ground. It is the birthplace of the three Gago de Mendoza brothers, distinguished sailors.  \\n\nOn 12 April 1888, the Méndez Núñez Hotel (demolished in the 1980s) was inaugurated on the west side of the square. It had a restaurant and a meeting room. When it closed, it became a bus stop.  The hotel was born during the first hotel boom caused by the arrival of the railway in the nearby Station Square .  In 1932, the editorial office of the literary magazine Cristal was located in the attic of the hotel and was visited by Federico García Lorca .  \\n\nIn 1902, the building of the Café Moderno was finished, commissioned by Bernardo Martínez Bautista, an emigrant who became rich in Cuba, on the site of the former pazo of the Gago de Mendoza and Montenegro families. In 1903, the Café Moderno was inaugurated on the ground floor with a distinguished atmosphere, a meeting point for meetings and film screenings, and the paving of the square was carried out by the master builder Mr. Miranda.  In 1904, the busy square was the setting for a film screening of Ali Baba.  In the first decades of the 20th century, the square had a newstand in its centre and became a cultural epicentre and meeting place for Galician intellectuals.  \\n\nIn December 1943, the renovation of the paving and pavements of the square was approved, as well as the sewage system.  In 1944, the Pontevedra Savings Bank acquired a building under construction on the site of the former St. Joseph\\'s Chapel for its provincial headquarters and inaugurated the new building in 1948.  \\n\nThe square was called Plaza de San José until 1931 when it was called Plaza de Pablo Iglesias. On 28th December 1936, the square was renamed Plaza de San José  and in democracy it was called Plaza de Calvo Sotelo before it reverted to its traditional name of St. Joseph\\'s Square on 25 April 1996.\\n\nThe square was completely redeveloped in 2001 and transformed into a semi-pedestrian area.   \\n\nIn 2006, the Tertulia Monument was installed in the centre of the square,  as a tribute to the Galician intellectuals linked to the Café Moderno in the first decades of the 20th century.  \\n\nDescription\nThe square has an irregular triangular shape and the five streets of Marquis de Riestra , Oliva , Rosalía de Castro, San José and Augusto García Besada converge here. It is one of the focal points of the city\\'s first urban expansion .\\n\nThe square is paved with alternating grey and sepia-coloured tiles  and is semi-pedestrian, with a single lane of traffic in the northern part that channels traffic from Marquis de Riestra Street to Augusto González Besada Street.    \\n\nThe square is dominated to the north by the Café Moderno building , and to the southeast by the Pontevedra Savings Bank building . In the middle of the square, on a base of polished black granite, stands the Tertulia monument , created in 2006 by the sculptor César Lombera to commemorate the meetings held here by Galician intellectuals.  Above the building of the Pontevedra Savings Bank overlooking the square is the statue of Teucer , the mythical founder of the city, also created in 2006 by the sculptor Cándido Pazos.  \\n\nThe square has a total of sixteen trees: five Chinese magnolias , three Siberian crab apple trees and three red apple trees, both grafted onto native apple varieties, as well as five apple trees grafted onto Asian apple trees.  \\n\nOutstanding buildings\nOn the northwest side of the square are the remains of the Baroque pazo of the Gago de Mendoza and Montenegro families, which currently has two floors. Its pointed battlements stand out in the upper part, decorated in the centre with six-pointed stars inscribed in a circle.  \\n\nOn the north side of the square and next to the old pazo of the Gago de Mendoza family is the Café Moderno building , with an eclectic stone fa\\xc3 7ade and the most important art nouveau interior in the city. It has three floors, housing the Café Moderno on the ground floor. The fa\\xc3 7ade has wrought iron galleries and geometrically shaped ornamental elements.  \\n\nOn the southeast side of the square is the central building of the Pontevedra Savings Bank . It is a majestic stone building with four floors and a ground floor. The large hall, which can be accessed from the main entrance, connects the different areas of the building.  \\n\nGallery\nReferences\nSee also"

        "page_content": "Contents\nMercado de las Carnes\n\\n\nMercado de las Carnes (English: Meat Market ), also known as La Plaza de los Perros  (English: Dogs\\' Plaza ), but formally, Plaza Juan Ponce de León (Juan Ponce de León Plaza), was the first building in Puerto Rico to mix social and architectural elements via the pedestrian mall concept.  The historic Art Deco architecture structure is located in Ponce, Puerto Rico , and dates from 1926.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.  The Plaza was rebuilt in 1992, under the administration of Mayor Churumba .  It is located in the alley connecting Mayor and Leon streets, in the block between Estrella and Guadalupe streets. The Plaza and the alley are one and the same.\\n\nHistory\nPonce\\'s Plaza de los Perros (English: Plaza of the Dogs), receives its name from the packs of stray dogs that gathered there to feed on the discarded meat scraps. A product of the rapid urban growth experienced in the city during the early 20th century, the Plaza was built in 1926 to relieve the overcrowded farmer\\'s market (\"Plaza del Mercado\") and provide an adequate market place for perishable meat products.  \\n\nSignificance\nLocated across the street from the historic Plaza del Mercado (Farmer\\'s Market) the Plaza de los Perros serves as an urbanistic and commercial complement to the market place. Occupying a long, narrow lot, previously belonging to two back-to-back structures, the meat market connects two of Ponce\\'s busiest commercial streets, Mayor and Leon, providing mid-block circulation to the main market by means of the pedestrian mall concept so popular today. Of significance is the adaptation of such innovative concepts to traditional social and architectural elements (the farmers\\' market and Moorish detailing), representing the contemporary modernistic trends in architecture. The double-function of such a traditional space was an innovation in Ponce and in Puerto Rico as a whole.  \\n\nOf great importance is that the building\\'s design bears the signature of Rafael Carmoega , one of the most established Puerto Rican architects of the 20th century. A graduate of the Cornell University School of Architecture and subsequent director of the Architectural division of Puerto Rico\\'s Department of the Interior, Carmoega also designed the Capitol Building , the University of Puerto Rico Main Campus at Rio Piedras , the School of Tropical Medicine , and the Mayaguez City Hall , all listed on the National Register , in addition to other significant buildings. In his interest to preserve Hispanic traditions in the wake of the recent change of sovereignty from Spain to the United States , Carmoega utilized the Spanish Baroque and Neo- Mudejar vocabularies in his designs, emphasizing the use of glazed, mosaic tiles in many buildings. The Plaza de los Perros is a fine example of this latter style, incorporating glazed mosaics, horseshoe arches, and galleries in a mosque -like space for commercial usage.  \\n\nPhysical appearance\nThe old \"Mercado de las Carnes\", or Meat Market, occupies a narrow through-lot connecting Mayor and Leon streets at the center of the block between Estrella and Guadalupe streets.  In plan, the concrete, wood, and sheet-metal structure consists of an elongated quadrangle created by galleries opening onto an attenuated interior court. The neo- mudejar and Art Deco decorative facades appear to be independent of the actual utilitarian structure inside, as they shift slightly in opposite direction off the central court axis to accommodate the mall.  \\n\nThe east and west facades are identical, each consisting of a rectangular mass of approximately 20 feet (6.1 m) in height and 30 in width, which defines the major fa\\xc3 7ade element. This rectangle is divided into five ground-storey bays: a series of three central bays flanked by slightly narrower wall areas. The bays are defined by a series of four vertical buttress-like piers which extend slightly above the ridge of the building.  \\n\nThe three central bays form the frontispiece of the facade, each of similar dimensions and created as an access to the interior court. Each bay contains a horseshoe arch approximately one-half the height of the facade and almost the full width of the bay. Above each arch, a decorative spandrel panel contains glazed mosaic tiles in intricate Moorish patterns. Within each bay, a horizontal band stretching between the concrete piers separates the spandrel area from the parapet above. The parapet is completely solid above the central bay, whereas the parapets of the flanking bays are articulated with open, semi-circular concrete forms. At this level, the concrete piers are decorated with vertical rectangular panels of glazed multi-colored mosaic tiles.  \\n\nThe bays flanking the frontispiece are solid and without articulation, although the southern bay has been punctured at ground level by wide, wooden doors as access to a street-side refreshments stand. A concrete cantilever shades the entrance and a vertical sign above announces the name of each business.  \\n\nAt the interior court, a series of simplified, square, Tuscan columns creates a gallery enclosing individual market areas within each bay. The stoa-like galleries are sheltered by a wood and sheet-metal roof pitched inward toward the court. Additional continuous wood and sheet-metal eaves , stemming from the colonnade and suspended by link-chains from the architrave provide shelter within the court for those doing their shopping.  \\n\nThis property has remained basically unaltered all elements described contribute to the structure\\'s value. The only alteration is the refreshments stands\\' sign and the covering of the upper part of the stand\\'s arch which are non-contributing elements.  \\n\nEffect of 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes\nThe roof of the structure was damaged due to the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes and Plaza Juan Ponce de León had to be closed for repairs. As a result, vendors had to vacate their shops and remove their merchandise. Provisional repairs were announced to take approximately two weeks, after which merchants could then move back in. Municipal government plans were to prepare plans for a more permanent restoration of the roof at a later date.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza Las Américas (Puerto Rico)\nPlaza Las Américas is a shopping mall in Hato Rey, San Juan, Puerto Rico , located at the intersection of Routes 18 and 22 . \" Plaza \", as it is known to many Puerto Ricans , was the first indoor shopping mall built in Puerto Rico.  It is the largest shopping mall in the Caribbean and the second largest in Latin America .  Anchor stores are JCPenney , Macy\\'s , Sears , Sears Brand Central, Forever 21 , Old Navy , Caribbean Cinemas and Marshalls . Previously, there was a Kmart store near the mall.\\n\nHistory\nIn 1918, siblings Jerónimo, Rosa, Gerardo, and Jaime Fonalledas acquired 527 acres (2.13 km 2 ) of land previously known as \"Las Monjas\". This land was property of Don Pablo Ubarri Capetillo, the Count of Santurce.  By 1920, little by little cane harvesting was eliminated with the intention of using the land for the creation of a milk company, eventually known as \" Vaquería Tres Monjitas \".  \\n\nIn 1950, the metropolitan area of San Juan was growing rapidly. The planning board began to build the project and ordered the development of the lands. It is then that the Fonalledas brothers came up with the idea of establishing a regional shopping center in the \"Las Monjas\" property. The planning board included a space of 15 acres of land for a shopping center in its development plan.  \\n\nOn March 8, 1963, site preparation was to begin soon for the first regional shopping center in Puerto Rico , it had been reported by J. I. Kislak Inc., of Newark, N. J. , named by the Fonalledas brothers of San Juan , developers of the project, to direct the planning, leasing, promotion, and financing of the first stage of the center. To be known as Plaza Las Américas, the retail facility would have approximately 900 feet of frontage on Franklin D. Roosevelt Avenue, directly opposite the city\\'s new $5 million municipal stadium. Initial plans called for construction of an $8 million first section, which would contain approximately 550,000 square feet of retail store space. This section would cover about 50 acres in the development. Parking space would be provided for 4,200 cars. The center had been planned to give the largest possible number of local merchants an opportunity to solve their needs for expansion, as well as their parking and traffic problems. One of two major department stores, including a local one, would form the hub of a 55 store development. According to the Kislak realty firm, merchants at the Plaza Las Américas shopping center would provide the widest variety of products and services ever assembled in Puerto Rico at one location. The shopping center was being designed by Lathrop Douglass, New York architect, in cooperation with Sacmag of Puerto Rico Inc., a leading architectural and engineering firm in San Juan at the time. Douglass and his associates had designed more than 40 large shopping centers throughout the United States .  \\n\nOn January 26, 1964, Macy\\'s , New York department store, was reported seriously considering opening a store in the Plaza Las Américas, which would be the largest shopping center on the island when completed. Construction had just started and it would be an estimated two years before completion. Representatives from Macy\\'s arrived on the island that  week to confer with officials of the shopping center. If satisfactory leasing terms could be arranged there was a strong possibility Macy\\'s would open up there. This would be its first store outside of the continental United States .  \\n\nOn January 18, 1965, it was reported that the J. C. Penney Company , second largest department store chain in the United States at the time, had signed a lease for a major retail unit in Plaza Las Américas shopping center, in San Juan , Puerto Rico . Announcement was made by the J. I. Kislak  Organization which was representing the owners of the planning, leasing, financing, and promotion of the center. Slated for construction to start October, 1965, Plaza Las Américas would occupy a 120-acre site fronting approximately 1,000 feet on Franklin D. Roosevelt Avenue, directly opposite the Municipal Stadium, in the geographic center of the city. The new store would comprise 170,000 square feet of floor space, and would be the largest department store ever built in Puerto Rico , as well as one of the largest in the Penney chain In its first stage, Plaza Las Américas would have 550,006 square feet of floor space, and would feature a completely enclosed, air-conditioned, all weather mall, for the comfort and convenience of shoppers. Investment for the entire project is expected to reach $3 million, which would also include an area devoted to high-rise apartments. Lathrop Douglas was the architect, in, cooperation with Sagmag, of Puerto Rico . The Kislak firm reported that approximately 70 stores will be located in the center, and that negotiations were currently underway with a retailing chain for another major department store, which would complement the Penney unit. In addition, Kislak said, firm commitments had already been obtained from representative local concerns for a substantial number of stores in the retail hub. Owners of the property were Jeronimo and Jaime Fonalledas, of San Juan . They were represented at the signing by their local counsel, Jaime Saldana, and by Arthur Levin, of New York . The J. C. Penney Company was represented by Everett Moore, then vice-president, and by Elting Smith, the chain\\'s counsel. Negotiations for Penney were conducted by Ralph P. Betts. The 1,700-store at the time Penney chain, founded in 1902, expected to reported sales in excess of $2 billion this year.  \\nOn March 18, 1966, it was reported that A Newark based firm had provided mortgage financing for the largest regional shopping center in Latin America. The J. I. Kislak Organization reported that its Mortgage Division has arranged an $11,000,000 mortgage for 25 years with The Equitable Life Assurance Society on Plaza Las Américas, a 596,000 square foot retailing complex being built in the Hato Rey section of San Juan, Puerto Rico . Scheduled for completion in the fall of 1967, Plaza Las Américas covered a 55nacre tract at Franklin D. Roosevelt Avenue and Las Americas Express, opposite the municipal stadium. The Kislak Organization was the development consultant and leasing broker for the owners, the Fonalledas family, of San Juan . Major tenant of the new shopping hub would  be the J. C. Penney Co. , with. a 277,000 square foot department store, one of the largest in its nationwide chain at the time. The F. W. Woolworth Co . would also have a 48,000 square foot variety store. More than 30 stores by this point were leased. Among them were units of the Pueblo Supermarkets chain, First Federal Savings and Loan Association , Commonwealth Theatres , Thom McAn Shops , Singer Sewing Machine Co. , and many other large San Juan retailers.  \\n\nOn July 15, 1967, it was reported that Plaza Las Américas, Inc. held its first meeting of tenants and architects that day at the site of the shopping center that was being built in Hato Rey . All tenants were invited. It was the first time that Plaza Las Américas had invited to see the progress of the construction. The huge shopping center, which would have space for approximately 75 tenants. The site was 50 acres of land with parking facilities for approximately 4,000 cars. Plaza Las Americas would have 750,000 square feet of air-conditioned retail space including the 3 J.C. Penney floors. One of the main aspects of Plaza Las Américas was its air-conditioned gallery. Approximately 14 acres of land would be occupied with buildings that would house the stores. J. I. Kislak Organization were the exclusive leasing agents for Plaza Las Américas. Peter Jacobson, the center\\'s project manager, said tenants were invited along with their architects and decorators to see how construction was going. According to Jacobson, Plaza Las Américas would be finished by the fall of 1968. The purpose of this meeting, according to Jim Vickers, manager at the time of J. I. Kislak, was to show tenants and their architects the many advantages of an enclosed gallery. This was a new business concept that had never been used in Puerto Rico . All the stores would be open to the gallery, offering the buyer absolute comfort and protection from inclement weather and traffic, and at the same time a pleasant atmosphere that invited shopping. Vickers said that Plaza Las Américas would have a Spanish motif in its architecture. Sacmag of P. R. were the architects for the project. In addition to J.C. Penney , the Kislak Organization was negotiating with other major local department stores to occupy approximately 10% of all leasable space. Among the tenants and officers who attended the meeting were Don Jerónimo and Jaime Fonalledas, main owners of Plaza Las Américas: representatives of J.C. Penney ; Joseph Aramanda, Senior Vice President of the J.I. Kislak Organization; John Kelly, Kislak VP and executives of the 75 tenants that would occupy the site. Jacobson explained that Plaza Las Américas was employing 400 men in the construction work, but he expected that in the following 60 days the number would rise to 700. He reported that the gallery would have a park with water fountains and notably an area where children can play. \"This will be one of the largest and most modern shopping malls. Plaza Las Américas will have a wide variety of stores, from large department stores to a movie theater. It will be a city within a city,\" Jacobson said. Among the many local firms that would occupy Plaza Las Américas were: Pueblo , Lema, Velasco , Clubman, Tartak, La Favorita, Bird\\'s, Naveira, and the First Federal Savings and Loan Association .  \\nOn October 28, 1967, The J. I. Kislak Organization of Newark, N. J., announced that González Padín , Puerto Rico\\'s oldest and best known department store chain at the time, had signed a multi-million dollar lease for a 2-story, 76,500 square foot building in Plaza Las Américas, the air conditioned regional shopping center being built. The $35 million shopping hub, to be the largest on the island, was scheduled to open in fall of 1968. This was the second major department store brought by the Kislak realty firm, the center\\'s exclusive leasing broker, to Plaza Las Americas. Kislak had previously announced that the J. C. Penny Company would have a 3-story, 277,000 square foot store there.  \\n\nOn November 30, 1967, it was reported that it was expected that by August 1968 the gigantic commercial project that would bear the name of Plaza Las Américas would be inaugurated, in Hato Rey . The mall was being built at a cost of $35 million. This would be the most modern and complete shopping center in Latin America, and only comparable with some in the big cities of the United States , revealed the general manager of the project, Mr. Peter Jacobson. Construction, which was on track and expected to be completed according to plan, began in April that year. Plaza Las Américas already had 90 percent of its space, said Mr. Jacobson, with 72 commercial companies that have separate premises. These included two theaters owned by Commonwealth Theaters , the largest of the 80 spaces J.C. Penney , a Pueblo grocery store, a Velasco branch, another González Padín , Tartak, Petrie, Woolworth , and two banks: a branch of First Federal and another of First National City . The project had 800,000 square feet of floor space, said Mr. Jacobson, and free parking space for 4,000 vehicles. A few of the mall\\'s outstanding facilities were, gardens, fountains, benches, terrazzo floor and other facilities, through which you would be able to reach all the shops and establishments in the shopping mall. The only one comparable at the time to this promenade is one that joined a commercial sector in the city of Montreal, said Mr. Jacobson. The architects who planned the plaza tried to preserve the traditional Spanish structure in the arcades, vaulted ceilings and wooden beams in the low ceilings. Plaza Las Américas was of the type known as a \"regional shopping center\". The owners were Puerto Ricans, the Fonalledas family. For the construction, the initial loan was granted by the First National City Bank and the long-term loan by the Equitable Life Insurance Co. It was being built by the company Sacmag. It had three accesses: one by the Las Américas Expressway and another by Roosevelt Avenue and the third by the side street that was being built together with the project. The idea of this shopping center, said Mr. Jacobson, was that the person upon entering it was able to find where to carry out all their errands, from recreation, restaurants, shops, beauty salons, banks, laundries, etc. All day the doors would be kept open, closing only at night, said Mr Jacobson, as access to the shops was by through the walk. It was 1,500 feet long and by 40 feet wide and consisted of three sections, one long and two more cross sections. The highest and most spectacular points of the covered promenade would be in front of González Padín and J. C. Penney stores, according to Mr. Jacob. He added that the inauguration of Plaza Las Américas was to be held in August.  \\nOn September 12, 1968, the Plaza las Américas shopping mall would officially inaugurate. The large complex of buildings, comprising a fully air-conditioned commercial space, occupies an area of 54 acres, with free parking facilities for 4,000 cars. And it was, definitively, a contribution of the Puerto Rican initiative to the growing social and economic development of the country at the time. With 850,000 square feet of construction, Plaza Las Américas, in its first stage, housed in its then modern structure that followed the harsh lines of colonial architecture in its exterior design, 79 establishments, including a branch of González Padín , Mueblerías Tartak, First Federal Savings, Joyería Naveira, Farmacias González, Velasco , Pueblo Supermarkets ,  and other important local firms, eighty percent of which were Puerto Rican . Likewise, in the Plaza Las Américas Shopping Center, which opened that day, J. C. Penney\\'s opened in Puerto Rico, a store with a space of 278,000 square feet, considered the largest establishment built by the chain in any of the markets where it operated. With the name of Plaza Theaters 1 and 2, the cinema opened as a two twin movie theater, in fact, the second of its kind in Puerto Rico at the time, in which they would present weekly premieres to the delight of the public. In Plaza Las Américas, the concept of providing the public with extensive facilities had been developed, not only so that they could benefit from an extensive selection of products and services, which could be purchased from a single stop in the center, but also so that they could enjoy the same throughout the day. These facilities included the Center Gallery, fully air-conditioned, magnificently decorated with tiled ropes ornamented with a profuse variety of tropical plants, seating areas, and the pleasant atmosphere that reigned throughout the establishment; nine establishments where food and refreshments were sold; the twin theaters with a capacity for 1,600 people, banking and savings facilities, pharmacies, and all kinds of \\'boutiques\\' were also featured in this massive shopping destination. Plaza Las Américas was considered the most spectacular shopping center in Latin America and Puerto Rico , standing out, both for its design and its facilities, among the most modern and attractive in the United States at the time.  The following year, the architectural design of Plaza Las Américas would win the URBE Award for Best Commercial Architecture  \\nOn September 13, 1968, it was reported that on Inauguration day around 35,000 people arrived at the newly opened Plaza las Américas at the time.  \\nOn July 17, 1969, it was reported that during the month of August of that year, Plaza Las Américas would have another service that would increase the benefits enjoyed by the many consistent customers of the largest shopping center in Latin America at the time. This would be the Shell service center, which would be located on the center grounds and would sell gasoline, oil and car accessories. Diagnostics of a mechanical nature would also be offered.  \\n\nOn September 10, 1969, with a cocktail party attended by prominent figures of Puerto Rican commerce and banking, the first anniversary of the commercial complex of Plaza las Américas was celebrated. The event was attended by a large number of representatives of the 79 commercial establishments located in Plaza las Américas the at the time largest shopping center in Latin America. Miss Rosita Fonalledas, one of the founders of Plaza Las Américas lit the symbolic candle and cut the cake on the first anniversary of the shopping complex. Miss Rosita Fonalledas was accompanied at the event by her other three siblings: Geronimo, Jaime, and Gerardo. Mr. José Antonio Gorbea, administrador of the commercial complex said that \"Plaza Las Americas has been more successful than expected.\" He pointed out that none of those originally established in the shopping complex had suspended their operations. He further stated that the two banks that reside there have also had a good year of operations. For his part, Mr. Manuel Fernández. President of the Plaza Merchants Association stated that \"the Puerto Rican community has supported us in this first year of operations.\" He indicated that \"all the merchants have informed us that they have had higher sales than they expected in their first year of being here.\" Another who expressed his opinion, Mr. Gordon Peterson, General Manager of the store J.C. Penney at the time noted that \"we are extremely pleased with the operation of our establishment in Plaza Las Americas.\"  \\n\nIn March 1970, Woolworth\\'s would open its first Harvest House Grill in Puerto Rico at the mall, accompanying the Woolworth\\'s Restaurant which had been a staple at the mall up to that point.   \\n\nOn June 10, 1975, it was reported that the management of the Sears store chain had set the goal of opening two new stores in Puerto Rico for the year 1978, as was announced during a telephone interview by Robert B. Gibson, then President of Sears Roebuck de Puerto Rico, Inc. According to Gibson, Sears management at the time was in negotiations with the management of Plaza Las Américas, Inc., owners of the Plaza las Américas shopping complex, for the construction of a new Sears store in the shopping center. The store would be similar in size to the ones Sears that operated at the time in Hato Rey and Bayamón , and would be located in an extension of Plaza las Américas, towards the north side of the mall. The new store would be approximately 300,000 square feet of retail, office and warehouse space, covering approximately 135,000 square feet of retail space.  \\n\nOn December 7, 1975, one of the main corridors of Plaza Las Américas anchored by González Padín was decorated with Christmas motifs and decorations, reflecting the joy of the season. To the left, in the background, you could see the tall and colorful Christmas tree that was placed in the aforementioned corridor.\\n\nOn November 26, 1976, a new Baskin Robbins Ice Cream store would open next to the Plaza Theatres.  \\n\nOn September 3, 1978, on Plaza las Américas 10th anniversary new plans for expansion would be announced. Plaza la Américas, had proposed to enlarge its image and grow to become the largest commercial Regional Center in Latin America. To do this, the following would be done step by step. The center expansion project, which had begun recently, entailed the ambitious plan to provide the people of Puerto Rico with the largest and best number of conveniences within a single area. Hence its impressive growth rate: from 840,000 to 1,400,000 square feet. To offer the most varied selection of merchandise, the number of stores would increase from 76 to 185; and among others, it would have the largest Sears store in Puerto Rico, in a 280,000 square foot building. Regarding the parking area, there will be a total of more than 5,500 parking spaces, including a parking building with space for eight hundred mobile cars. Parking in this building would be free. The building would have a panoramic elevator, interior stairs and covered bridges for pedestrians, which would connect directly with the central galleries of the expansion, on each of its levels. Two independent ramps would facilitate the entry and exit of cars to the parking building, which would be partitioned off by the parking area. J.C. Penney\\'s . In addition to the additional parking areas, the concept of the access roads to the center had to be completely changed, as well as the parking areas themselves. At the same time, the lighting in the parking lot was being remodeled, for which the existing light poles would be replaced by ones that were one hundred feet high, similar to those used on highways. This represented a significant advance, since in addition to projecting more effective lighting, it constituted a more efficient measure for the conservation of electrical energy. There would be a third level of 44,000 square feet, which would be dedicated exclusively to the sale of all kinds of food and entertainment. This area would remain open at night, so that everyone who attends the two theaters that will open there, as well as its amusement rooms, could fully enjoy the international food restaurants that would remain open every night of the week. A gigantic skylight would illuminate this entire area, which would also have various fast food service stands. Once the expansion was complete, it would not be possible to distinguish between the original central gallery and the new ones, since all the architectural elements used in the expansion would also be used in the existing areas. The roofs would have skylights at intervals, allowing light from outside to come in nicely. The floors, made of ceramic tiles in natural colors, would have shades that would vary by section to avoid monotony. There would be countless seating areas, with comfortable benches and attractive ornamental plants. Two ornamental fountains would be located, one in front of González Padín and the other at an intermediate point between J. C. Penny\\'s and Sears . A modern gazebo specially designed to make them look more attractive would be provided. The gazebo would be located in front of J. C. Penney\\'s , and would be raised two or three feet above ground level, so that it would be more visible to all.  \\nOn December 28, 1978,  the president of Sears Roebuck de Puerto Rico, Inc. at the time, R. B. Gibson, announced the final closing of the Sears store in Hato Rey had already begun. Gibson said that all the merchandise in the Hato Rey store would be sold \"because we don\\'t want to move any merchandise to our new store in Plaza las Américas.\" The liquidation would include not only the merchandise, but also the shelves, office equipment and articles shop decorations. \"The decision to close Hato Rey and move to Plaza was a very difficult one to make, as our Hato Rey store has always been one of the most successful stores in the entire organization; however, the continued increase in sales of said store required moving to Plaza Las Américas, where we will be able to serve our customers with approximately fifty percent more sales space,\" added Gibson. The Hato Rey Sears store was inaugurated on November 2, 1962.  \\n\nOn February 11, 1978, it was reported that the honorable Mayor of San Juan, Dr. Hernán Padilla would be cutting the ribbon for the opening of the new Sears store at Plaza Las Américas during the ceremony that would take place on Monday, February 12 at 9:30 am.  \\n\nOn September 23, 1979, on Plaza las Américas 11th anniversary. Plaza las Américas would have 183 stores in total and an office building, after the expansions which would be completed the following year. The first step of the expansions was already a reality in the new stores integrated in an extension of the first level and in a second level. The expansion meant a total investment of $22 million for the center, which was added to the $15 million original investment. Of that $22 million, $2 million went toward redecorating the interiors of the entire mall to integrate with the expansions to create an integrated center in terms of appearance and unify the architectural theme. This included installing new flooring, new roofs, painting the complex, paving and redistributing the parking lot, removing poles and replacing them with a new, more efficient lighting system.  New fountains designed and manufactured by Crystal Fountains were also being installed. One of them was the tallest in proportion to the confined space built by that renowned firm. Doing a bit of history, Mr. Joseph H. Martin, general manager of Plaza Las Américas, commented that the shopping complex was inaugurated on September 12, 1968, with 76 stores in 747,000 square feet on a 55-acre property. The expansions, which had since been envisioned, now utilize a 75-acre site and 1,228,000 square feet of space. Precisely for having planned expansions for the Plaza, the original building was located on the corner of the land. Another department store was expected to be added to the set of stores. Of vital importance that an expansion had to include was the integration of specialty stores to complement the general merchandise stores, so that gaps could be filled. For this reason, when granting space in the Plaza, a very careful selection was made, with the idea that the public manages to get all those peculiarities that are difficult to find in general stores. Another need that was seen as part of the expansion plan, according to Mr. Martin, was the reorganization of the sites for meals and entertainment. There was not enough variety, apart from the fact that they had to be placed where there could be easy access to them at times when the stores were not open. That\\'s where the idea of the third level came from. A food and entertainment center called \"La Terraza\". It would be an area with tables and chairs around which there will be several fast food outlets. You could choose between Italian, Chinese food, sandwiches and other varieties. People would buy and go to the tables to enjoy it. Two additional cinemas, a game room, a fishmonger, a butcher and two restaurants would be located on the same floor. At the other extreme, the facilities that belonged to the Cervantes Restaurant would soon be available to turn that corner into another food and entertainment center.  In terms of parking, Plaza increased its capacity from 4,000 to 5,900 spaces. Its new parking building also provided 1,050 spaces. The culmination of the Plaza\\'s expansion program would be the 11-story tower whose plans were complete and construction was to begin early the following year. \"An office tower on this shopping center provides a work climate that is difficult to duplicate in a conventional commercial sector. It has the unbeatable advantages of Express, parking, shops, food, and we are convinced of its success,\" said the general manager of Plaza las Américas.  Since services could not be missing in an expansion plan of this magnitude, Plaza would now have a Care Center Daytime for children by Mrs. Annabel Ubarri. Mothers and fathers would be able to buy in peace after leaving the children in those facilities that had access through the second level of the shopping center. Two additional services that Plaza would offer would be, in the first instance, a photocopying center; and a Center for Government Agencies where customers can carry out simple transactions for the Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, the Telephone Company and the Fluvial Sources Authority. Finally, in the long term, this super regional shopping center plans to use six acres to its west to develop a small shopping center where a series of services difficult to find in Puerto Rico , but very necessary, which would be established. It was expected that the primary tenant at that facility would be a home care facility. The interior design of Plaza Las Américas would be the work of the architects Orval Sifontes and Nikita Zukov, while the construction works were in charge of Bird Construction, Pavarini Construction, Desarrollos Metropolitanos and ORM Construction.  \\nOn August 19, 1981, on the first floor of the mall being located in front of Velasco , Command Performance would inaugurate a salon in Plaza las Américas.  \\n\nOn January 27, 1983,  La Terraza would be the focus of the plans for Plaza Las Américas that year, according to the mall\\'s then Marketing Director, Miss April Hough. She made known the interest of the administration of Plaza Las Américas in promoting La Terraza for the conveniences that its food facilities represent for the public, which were open from 8 am some and from 10 am others, until 10 pm seven days a week. That is why a year earlier they had animated the place with live music and this year they were organizing a varied series of activities. For March, in terms of activities in the mall, they were already working in coordination with the Women\\'s Affairs Commission to organize activities aimed at celebrating Women\\'s Week, from March 6 to 12. As for stores, others would soon open their doors in addition to two that opened in December, T. Shirt Place and Euromodas. On the other hand, Empresas Fonalledas owners of Plaza las Américas, had long-term plans. One was to open another mall in Ponce , under the name of Plaza del Caribe and they had also recently acquired the Arecibo Mall in Arecibo . Another plan, for eventual development, was the construction of an 11-story office tower on top of Plaza las Américas (which would be considered as a 7-story structure). Around the surrounding grounds, Miss Hough replied that they were receiving proposals of what could be done there. In Plaza Las Américas they were optimistic about the sales of 1983, judging by the month of January that \"it\\'s been very good.\"  \\nOn March 11, 1984, Plaza las Américas would be called an \"all-consuming passion\". The 15-year-old operation at the time had been a huge financial success. Its $240 million in annual sales had put it among the top 2% of the 35,000 shopping centers around the world. J.C. Penney\\'s plaza store was the chain\\'s nationwide sales leader.  Elderly retired men sat on the mall\\'s benches, reading and animatedly discussing teenagers parading around a large fountain that spurted to the ceiling; and families with tots in strollers often occupy most of the 960 tables on the huge third floor \"food court\", where Burger King , Orange Julius and 17 other eateries vie for the fast-food dollar.  \\nOn November 21, 1985, amid immense hullabaloo, illuminations, and Christmas decorations, the seasonal decoration of Plaza Las Américas was lavishly inaugurated. To artistically celebrate such a great event, the management of the shopping center designed a program spectacular in which the orchestra of the Escuela Libre de Música, directed by Randolfo Juarbe, took part, as well as student choirs and the little violinists who studied at the Julio Sellés Solá school directed by the Professor Mario Rosa. The contagious notes of the traditional Christmas carols and Puerto Rican Christmas bonuses were heard in the Immense area of the Plaza, at about 7 at night forming a great choral mass, which was joined by the voices of many of the excited parishioners who watched spellbound events. The Plaza\\'s beautiful Christmas decorations were coordinated by Timi\\'s, and spanned all three levels of the enormous building. In front of the J.C. Penney , on the permanent dais where usually assembly is carried out exhibitions, the decorators created a snowy forest, in which tiny beings were found. The decoration in the galleries and corners of the shopping center, however, followed a different trend. In several sections there were trees on high platforms, surrounded by wooden gates, decorated with countless objects and garlands of multicolored lights. Numerous gift boxes, splendidly decorated with ribbons and festive paper, decorated the foot of each tree, which could be white or green. Through corridors and stairs, luminous spikes, multicolored bombs brightened the passage of concurrent. Each store collaborated by decorating their front of the store according to the merchandise that was sold, be it toys, clothing, dolls, porcelain, jewelry, crystals. The public thoroughly enjoyed the show, demonstrating it with the incessant applause that forced the orchestra to continue playing. Since the week earlier, Plaza Las Américas, aware of the number of people who flocked to said center, had started a very special valet service (at a cost of $2.00) to park your car and avoid the huge traffic jams that formed there. When requesting the service, they would give you a coupon that would allow you to claim your car when you had finished shopping.  \\n\nOn September 10, 1986, on the occasion of the celebration of the Eighteenth anniversary of Plaza Las Américas, the idea of designing an emblem that would reflect the theme of the celebrations arose. The emblem would be used on the different banners, posters and advertisements that would decorate the majestic shopping center. Thus, Abner Gutiérrez, creative director of Image Developers Group, was in charge of bringing this idea of the emblem to life at the time. He designed a stylized woman\\'s face, which highlighted the feminine style required for the theme. To achieve this, he used the parameters established by Plaza\\'s management: celebration of the 18th anniversary, theme News of fashion, with an emphasis on the feminine. \"Taking the parameters into account, I decided to develop a female face, which would represent a universal woman. I designed a face because fashion includes clothing, shoes, makeup, etc., and I did not want to tie the design to a specific fashion.\" Gutierrez explained. He added that the design was so universal that it managed to place women as the centerpiece of fashion, not fashion as something that governs women. Regarding the design style, Gutiérrez indicated that it is of the art-deco type, because that period (art-deco) had a great impact on the development of fashion at a popular level. In detail, the design was a stylization of a woman\\'s profile with thick lines. The lines are thick, he clarified, because the type of use that will be given to the emblem is prevented, for example, reproduction on posters and press advertisements. In view of this possibility, Gutiérrez explained, it was necessary to develop a simple but visually strong design that, regardless of the type of reproduction to which it was subjected, would maintain and reflect the theme of women. The colors of the design are pink and gunmetal gray. \"Pink because it is definitely a color associated with women and gunmetal because it is a neutral color that is very popular among fashion designers and creates a very nice combination with pink,\" explained Gutiérrez. Along with the design of the emblem, Gutiérrez prepared in his studio the art that would be used in the different pennants and posters that would adorn Plaza Las Américas in its great celebration.  \\n\nOn June 27, 1987,  Plaza Las Américas was considered the commercial emporium of Puerto Rico, and even of the Caribbean, the shopping center would be greatly strengthened with the prompt construction of a super modern eleven-story office tower according to Roberto Trápaga, from Plaza Leasing, Inc., the developer of the project, which would be known as One Plaza Tower. The realization of this project responded to the visionary plans of the originators of Plaza Las Américas, who anticipated the growth and success of Plaza as a shopping center, and estimated that in the near future it would be necessary to expand the structural services of the complex. That future had arrived, and the answer to those needs of the dynamic Puerto Rican society was One Plaza Tower. \"The world of shopping centers is something more than the unification of several stores. For this purpose, the concept that a center should be characterized by its mixed uses has been developed. This concept has been successful. And also, it has not been conflictive regarding the use of entertainment facilities. and services\", explained Trápaga. With the construction of One Plaza Tower, Plaza Las Américas would become a faithful example of the concept of mixed uses, according to Trápaga, since apart from including the current facilities, it would add a building that would house all kinds of community service offices. \"When you have such a continuous transit of people, the integration of different commercial aspects is more than necessary.\" he said. One Plaza Tower further complemented the evolution of Plaza Las Américas. \"We knew that in the future we would have to build an office tower. In this sense, and with a very accurate vision of the future, what is currently the square was built and integrated into the complex, so that in the future it would serve as a structural base for an office tower (One Plaza Tower)\", he emphasized. One Plaza Tower would be an integral part of the Plaza, with access to all its facilities: shops, restaurants, banking institutions, travel agencies, post offices, etc. According to Trápaga, the tower would be a first-class building with the most conveniences, advanced location, 6,000 parking spaces (free), complete fire protection (smoke detectors, alarms, sprinkler system, smoke extractors) and capacity for a helicopter to land. The project which was to be finished by the end of 1988, had a cost of approximately $18 million dollars.  As for the building, the entrance will be through the parking lot or the third level (La Terraza); the floors would be numbered from 4 to 14, not including 13, from floors 5 to 14 there would be 16,200 square feet for rent. Floors 4 and 15 would have approximately 15,265 rentable square feet.  \\n\nOn November 11, 1989, it was reported that Toys \"R\" Us , the largest toy store in the world at the time, was building its largest physical plant in the world on the grounds of Plaza las Américas, reported Guillermo Alvarez, director of Toys \"R\" Us in Puerto Rico . The store, the largest of 541 in the world, would be located in a 67,000 square foot building that was currently in the completion phase of its construction. \"Right now we are working on the finishes, as well as paving the parking lot that covers a space of 31 square meters,\" said engineer Edris Méndez, project manager for F & R Construction, the general contractor firm that was in charge of the project. The area designated for the Toys \"R\" Us store would be shared in the future with a Pueblo Xtra supermarket. \"The format of this new store, which we will open on December 1, will be the same as 95% of the Toys \"R\" Us stores in the world,\" Alvarez said. What made it the biggest is that there would be a huge warehouse area with a total of 37,000 square feet. The remaining area would be conditioned for sales.  \\n\nOn July 22, 1990, it would be reported that a Maternity Exclusive store inaugurated its new facilities on the first level of Plaza Las Américas. Nereida and Gerardo Márquez, owners of Maternity Exclusive, gave the guests a rich reception, where prominent personalities from the Plaza Las Américas business, and from the artistic environment such as Charityn and her then husband Elín Ortiz were present.  \\n\nOn August 16, 1990, it was reported that Plaza las Américas would be expanded to accommodate new stores, exhibition areas, and five new cinemas, according to documents submitted to the Planning Board. This expansion was in addition to the proposed construction of an 11-story office tower on the third floor of Plaza las Américas, which was long planned by this point. The proposed project consisted of the construction of two additional floors above the Velasco store with an area of approximately 72,000 square feet. The second of the new levels would be used to house new shops and display areas. The new cinemas would be located on the third level, which would have a total capacity of 2,039 seats. The expansion of the Velasco building and the remodeling of the third level of the shopping center was being designed by the designers Méndez, Brunner & Asociados. Despite several calls to the offices of the owners of Plaza las Américas, Las Empresas Fonalledas, it was not possible to know the total cost of this project or additional details of it. A source alleged to the project explained that the three cinemas that were currently located on the third level of the Plaza at the time would be eliminated and the space would be used to add fast food establishments in the La Terraza area. Likewise, in the space occupied by the Plaza III, Plaza IV and Plaza V cinemas, a community hall would be built for business meetings and public service. \"The Community Room will be used for public services such as blood donations, taxpayer orientation, etc,\" indicated the memorandum on the project submitted to the Planning Board. The project would also require an increase of 366 parking spaces. The project was in the permitting stage and precisely on the 7th of that month, the Planning Board held public hearings on the petition that was presented by representatives of Méndez, Brunner Asociados.  \\n\nIn 1992 to 1994, an expansion to Plaza las Américas would be done which included an extension of the food court La Terraza, of which the number of restaurants was increased from 19 to 24. The movie theater which was expanded from 5 to 10 screens, and the construction of La Torre de Plaza finally being completed at a cost of $15 million which added 146,000 square feet of rentable space to the retail complex.  \\nOn March 21, 1994, Burdines with undergoing negotiations at the time expected to start construction on its first Puerto Rico store, at Plaza Las Américas, in the following year. It would be the department store chain\\'s first foray outside of Florida and an initial step into Latin America , said Carey Watson, company spokesman for Burdines .  \\n\nOn October 25, 1995, Pier 1 Imports announced an agreement with Sears Roebuck de Puerto Rico to open six Pier 1 stores inside Sears department stores on the island. The new Pier 1 stores would have 2,000-3.000 square feet of sales space. The first two were scheduled to open in November of that year in the Sears store at Plaza las Américas, and in the Sears Homelife store at the Galerías Paseos shopping mall in San Juan .  \\n\nOn October 31, 1995, González Padín would announce the closure and liquidation of all its stores due to economic issues. The closure began on the 30th, with the closure of its main store, the one in Plaza las Américas, and the dismissal of the many employees who worked there. This would also include Velasco , which was owned by González Padín . The chain would completely close by December of that year.  \\n\nIn 1996, a 246 million dollar renovation was announced. Which consisted of the construction of a new 4-level (300,700 square foot) J. C. Penney . Which was being built on the west side of the existing store. And the repurposing the old Penney\\'s building once moved out as 3 levels of inline store and restaurant space.  \\n\nIn 1998, the J. C. Penney store at Plaza las Américas would re-inaugurate in a new building at the mall replacing the original at the time 30-year-old store, then becoming the largest store in the chain and being No. 1 in sales and profit that year.  \\nOn April 8, 1998, it was announced by company officials of the J. C. Penney store at Plaza las Américas, that a 70,000 square foot expansion would be opening, bringing the size of the store to 350,000 square feet. The four story expansion would be accessible by a tunnel from the existing store. J. C. Penney\\'s had higher average sales in Puerto Rico than in its stores in the United States that year. It had five stores in Puerto Rico and planned to open two more in 1999 in the towns of Caguas and Humacao .  \\n\nOn April 23, 1998, it would be reported that Kmart in November of that year would be inaugurating a store in Plaza Las Américas, which would be the largest store of the chain on the Island with 144,000 square feet.  \\n\nOn July 30, 1998, it was reported that Plaza las Américas, was about to grow even more. Over the next two years, the mall would add about 600,000 square feet to its current size at the time and about 100 new stores, including the first two-story Big Kmart in the United States and its territories, as well as the first Macy\\'s store to be established in the island. All this for nothing more than about $239 million. Upon completion it was estimated Plaza las Américas would have a total of 1.9 million square feet of retail space. The new establishments, according to the management of the center, would create at least 3,000 new jobs.  \\n\nOn August 18, 1998, it was reported that Federated Department Stores, Inc. , said it had reached an agreement to build a Macy\\'s store in San Juan, Puerto Rico , making for the retailer\\'s first international store. The store, was to begin construction at Plaza Las Américas, later that year, would open in the early fall of 2000. It would occupy three stories and 260,000 square feet. The store would be part of Cincinnati based Federated\\'s Macy\\'s East division. The division operated 87 stores in 15 states in the eastern United States .  \\nOn February 17, 2000, it was reported that Borders Group Inc. , the at the time $2.6 billion American bookstore chain, had chosen the Spanish-speaking U.S. Caribbean island of Puerto Rico for its first \"bilingual\" superstore.  In its cavernous two-story 28,750 square foot space in San Juan\\'s Plaza Las Americas, Borders was building the prototype for a planned push into Latin America. It was a breath of fresh air for Puerto Rico\\'s readers of English, who in the absence of chain bookstores had made do with woefully inferior selections. An opening date was scheduled for February 19th.   \\n\nOn June 8, 2000, it was reported that on the south mall area of Plaza las Américas, where Borders Books and Music was located, would also feature a two-level, 31,000 square foot Old Navy that summer, replacing part of the former space left by González Padín in 1995. Also opening in that summer would be a 13-screen multiplex. Plaza las Américas would also be adding a variety of restaurants on its first floor. Before the year\\'s end, the mall would feature about 10 restaurants on the south side of the mall, which would be a combination of popular priced local and stateside concepts. In that following year, the third floor of J. C. Penney\\'s previous site would be connected through a covered canopy to La Terraza. J. C. Penney\\'s third floor would also feature a 55,000 square foot entertainment and restaurant area.  \\n\nOn June 9, 2000, it was reported that Furniture and home accessories retailer The Bombay Co. would open its doors in Plaza Las Americas in November of that year, said Rodolfo Criscuolo, the company\\'s local licensee. The 2,750 square foot store was to be opened as part of the company\\'s first expansion outside the mainland U.S. it was expected to be among the chain\\'s five best-selling stores, according to a company spokesman.  \\n\nOn October 25, 2000, the first day of business at the first Macy\\'s department store outside the mainland United States had management beaming. Added Thousands of people strolled through the store on its opening day in San Juan\\'s premier mall, Plaza Las Americas. The party atmosphere at what was already a household name to many Puerto Ricans marked a milestone in the island\\'s highly desirable and fiercely competitive retail market. It was the newest of Macy\\'s 186 U.S. stores at the time and was molded to fit the tastes, weather and culture of the Caribbean . Macy\\'s chose Puerto Rico as the place for its overseas debut because so many of the residents were familiar with the chain, particularly its New York and South Florida stores, and because Plaza Las Américas had a reputation as one of the best retail malls in the northern hemisphere. The new Macy\\'s in San Juan had less to do with tourists and more to do with locals. The customers milling about the three-story, 260,000 square foot store found the designer labels and kitchen department they were accustomed to on the mainland, but also a mix of colors and fabrics they  wouldn\\'t find in other Macy\\'s stores. Louder, vibrant colors displaced some of the grayer tones in women\\'s clothing, while the winter colors in men\\'s clothes came in short sleeves. Two local high-end department stores, Velasco and González Padín , had closed down some years ago by this point. J.C. Penney and Sears , long focused on fashion in Puerto Rico . Now Macy\\'s had joined them, filling in a void in the market.  \\n\nOn October 4, 2001, it was reported that in those next two months, Plaza las Américas would be adding seven new establishments to its roster. These were Zara , Margarita\\'s, Oriental Palace, The Sony Store , The Bombay Co. , Ciao Mediterranean, and Constellations.

Constellations, also planned to open during that month, and would occupy 1,029 square feet.  \\n\nOn December 6, 2001, Plaza Las Américas had recently inaugurated a new commercial hallway where the original J. C. Penney used to be. This hallway already featured at the time Margarita\\'s Restaurant, an art exhibit by local artists, and various temporary tenants. Among them were Supershine, Collector\\'s World, Kiosko SALO, Gone Fishing, Chateau Rouge, Mr. Pretzel\\'s, Candy World and Abracadabra. The mall also welcomed new tenants such as Zara , Steve Madden , Bombay , and Naranja. In the following days both Oriental Express and Quicksilver were expected to open.  \\n\nOn March 1, 2003, it was reported that Farmacias El Amal would be opening a store in Plaza las Américas around April of that year, according to Lorraine Vissepo, communications director at the time of Empresas Fonalledas , owners of the mall. The store,  the chain\\'s 57th location on the island, would be the first full-service pharmacy in Plaza las Américas since January 1998, when Farmacias Gonzalez an original opening day tenant was closed to allow for the mall\\'s expansion.  \\n\nOn September 25, 2003, Lorraine Vissepo, communications director at Empress Fonalledas, the parent company of Plaza Las Américas, announced that new stores would be opening for business at the mall, with another under construction. She added that the shopping center\\'s performance in terms of sales and traffic remained positive. \"There\\'s a lot of movement in the mall; sales have continued to be satisfactory,\" she said. The stores opening or expanding were Reinhold Jewelry, McDonald\\'s , Adolfo Dominguez, and Cohen\\'s Fashion Optical. Church\\'s Fried Chicken was under renovation, according to Vissepo. She explained that Reinhold was expanding to include space vacated by Thekes bookstore. After the expansion was complete, the jewelry store would occupy a total of 3,663 square feet.

Adolfo Dominguez, a Spanish fashion boutique, would occupy 1,194 square feet and would be located on the mall\\'s first floor between Macy\\'s and J.C. Penney . Meanwhile, Cohen\\'s Fashion Optical would occupy the space previously used by women\\'s apparel store Nostalgia; it measured 1,386 square feet.  \\n\nIn 2004, a former Western Auto store on the premises of the mall was converted to a Sears Auto Center .\\n\nIn September 2005, the longstanding Plaza Theatres, which was by then operated by CineVista Theatres would close.  On October 1, 2005, CV Entertainment Group, the owner company of CineVista Theatres , announced an investment of US$6 million to transform the closed movie theater at the food court of Plaza Las Américas into a multimedia entertainment center that as of April 2006, would be known as Galaxy Lanes. It would include a mega bowling alley with 32 lanes, two restaurant areas, two bars (seating 500 people), 16 giant projection screens in the bowling area, a 20\\'x20\\' mega screen in the mezzanine area, multiple plasma monitors, wireless Internet connection, a dance floor and a DJ; a stage for live performances, pool tables, VIP rooms for parties, and a cabin for live radio and TV broadcasts. \"We are talking about a 40,000 square-feet multimedia entertainment center,\" said CV Entertainment Group Marketing & Operations VP Osvaldo Gonzalez.  \\n\nOn May 10, 2007, it was reported that Plaza las Américas, was in the midst of finalizing negotiations with New York based retailer Pottery Barn to open its first store on the island sometime in 2008.  \\n\nOn May 31, 2007, Maxine Clark , founder and chief executive bear of Build-a-Bear , announced the popular stuffed-animal chain had landed a coveted spot at Puerto Rico\\'s premier shopping center, Plaza Las Américas. The Build-a-Bear store, which was under construction, was expected to open sometime late June to early July of that year featuring its collection of Build-a-Bear customized stuffed animals plus some customized items for the local market for a local flair. The store would be located on the mall\\'s first floor, a couple of doors away from The Gap . In a market where there was practically no entertainment or educational  activities for children, \\'tweens\\' (ages 12-16) and for parents and children, Build-a-Bear was poised to become a bare necessity. The Plaza store was the first one of three to four locations expected to open on the island, each with a minimum investment of nearly $1 million and 35-40 full-time and part-time employees. \"It was well worth the wait,\" said Clark during an exclusive interview, referring to the six-year wait to find the ideal location at Plaza Las Américas. \"I knew we wanted to be in the Puerto Rico market, but you have to start with the best location. Plaza Las Américas affords us the opportunity to truly showcase our concept and I\\'m confident our family-oriented concept will win over the people of Puerto Rico. Island customers are warm and friendly people, very congruent with the in-store experience at Build-a-Bear.\"  \\n\nOn April 10, 2008, it was reported that New York based West Elm was set to begin operations at its first Puerto Rico store in Plaza Las Américas. During an exclusive interview, Dave DeMattei, president of west elm, confirmed, if successful, the Plaza store could be the first of several to open around the island. The store would have 20,000 square feet with 10,000 of those for selling space.  \\n\nOn March 5, 2009, it was reported that European giant retail beauty chain Sephora , which had revolutionized the U.S. cosmetic market since 1998, was finally coming to Puerto Rico . Sephora representatives, who in the past had shown no interest in the local market, had been in conversations with Plaza Las Américas leasing management for awhile. The Puerto Rico store was part of the chain\\'s multimillion dollar 2009 expansion plan. In 2001, there was an initial approach from the Plaza Las Américas team to Sephora, but to no avail; it was still too early in Sephora\\'s mainland expansion plan. In 2008, during the annual ICSC ( International Council of Shopping Centers ) convention, it was confirmed Sephora had in fact accepted an invitation from  Plaza Las Américas to explore a scenario whereby the company would come to Puerto Rico. Still, Plaza officials kept a tight lid on the matter. But the wait was over. Construction of the first Sephora store was underway in the lower level at Plaza Las Américas, near Radio Shack and West Elm . To accommodate the beauty retailer, Plaza Las Américas had to relocate the former fast food corridor in that area to make room for the new store. The arrival of Sephora on the island, a brand that was already known by many Puerto Rican customers who frequently traveled to the U.S. mainland, would certainly shake up the cosmetic and fragrance business category on the island, which was estimated to generate $100 million in annual sales.  \\n\nOn April 23, 2009, it was reported that Plaza Las Américas was preparing for the arrival of Los Angeles based Forever 21 , which would occupy the former Galaxy Lanes space in the mall\\'s third level which had closed in 2008.  The Puerto Rico store would be the chain\\'s first in Latin America . Slated to open that summer. The multi-level 40,000 square foot Forever 21 location at Plaza Las Américas, adjacent to Plaza\\'s La Terraza food court, was the latest flagship addition to the fashion chain with other international flagship operations in Canada , Korea , China and Singapore . It would generate 100 new jobs.  \\n\nOn June 9, 2011, it was reported that San Francisco based furniture and home retailer Pottery Barn (PB) likely would be closing its Plaza Las Américas store before  that year\\'s end. Pottery Barn\\'s exit, however, left space for the mall to relocate Foot Locker to PB\\'s 21,000 square foot location on the main level. Meanwhile, Foot Locker\\'s space would be transformed into a much sexier store to be occupied by Victoria\\'s Secret , according to Plaza Las Américas sources.  \\n\nOn July 18, 2011, it was reported that after 40 years in business, giant book retailer Borders Group would exit the market entirely and sell off its entire inventory. Borders filed for Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Law in February of that year and in Puerto Rico announced that same month the closure of its stores in Carolina and Mayagüez , and the subsequent liquidation. The Plaza Las Américas store was also reported to be closing its doors.  In January 2012, it was reported that Plaza las Américas had retained control of the former Borders space. The mall was now in a position to negotiate a future rental agreement of the 34,000 square-foot prime location.  \\n\nOn October 7, 2011, the magical world of the Disney Stores returned to the Plaza Las Américas shopping center after having closed its doors several years earlier. Dozens of eager people gathered at the mall to be the first to enjoy the store that was inaugurated that day. Boxer Tito Trinidad , along with his family, was in charge of opening the store.  \\n\nOn May 23, 2012, it was reported that Plaza Las Américas invested $12 million in remodeling the mall\\'s north entrance facade. The remodeling work began on May 23, 2012, and was completed by mid November 2012, just before the holiday season. In addition, between July-August 2012, expansion began on the multistory parking, located in the southern area of the mall. The expansion extended the five floors of multistory to add over 300 parking spaces. All parking areas of the mall were also repaved while new landscape gardens designs where developed in front of the main entrance.  \\n\nOn December 18, 2012, Plaza Las Américas confirmed that it signed an agreement for the establishment of The Cheesecake Factory in the shopping center. The establishment would have approximately 10,000 square feet and be located next to the new entrance, near Avenida Chardón. Construction of the restaurant was expected to begin in early 2013 and would open its doors to the public during the third quarter of the year. The investment was estimated at around $8 million.  \\n\nOn February 28, 2013, it was reported that Karen Millen would be opening their first store in Puerto Rico at the mall. Plaza Las Américas would also usher in its first Starbucks Coffee shop in the following months, to be located in a 943 square foot space between JCPenney and Macy\\'s .  \\n\nOn April 4, 2014, Sports Authority would open a store at Plaza las Américas.  It would later on close in March 2016 due to the chains bankruptcy.  \\n\nOn May 16, 2016, it would be reported that new stores would arrive at Plaza Las Américas with the announcement of the opening of Zapaventura, BienLatino, a second Starbucks store and Olive Garden .

The new Starbucks store, of approximately 1,500 square feet, would be located in front of the North fountain, right next to the Banco Santander branch and Olive Garden , of approximately 7,700 square feet, would be on the third level of the Central Atrium, in front of the Restaurant Land of Fire. Franklin Domenech, General Manager at the time of Plaza Las Américas, pointed out that \"the most visible remodeling works of Plaza las Américas concluded last year with the restoration of the skylight of the north fountain and the north panoramic elevator, the facade of La Terraza and the connecting corridor between The Terrace and the third level of the Central Atrium, where Walgreens is. Now we are remodeling the elevators of La Torre de PLAZA and soon the remodeling of the area in front of Banco Santander and Red Lobster will begin,\" he concluded. Rafael Ruiz-Comas, Director of Corporate Leasing added that \"this year the Tiffany and A\\'gaci stores have already opened and we expect more activity in new stores during the second half of 2016 to continue strengthening our commercial offer, starting with these four new stores that we are announcing today and that are owned by Puerto Rican businessmen and investors\". Mr. Ruiz Comas also informed that in the hallway where Banco Santander was located, first level near the North fountain, a transformation would soon begin with the start of construction of the first Red Lobster in Puerto Rico , the construction of Starbucks and the expansion of the Playero store and the Pearle optician .

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza Las Delicias\n\\n\nPlaza Las Delicias is the main plaza in the city of Ponce , Puerto Rico .  The square is notable for its fountains and for the various monuments it contains. The historic Parque de Bombas and Ponce Cathedral buildings are located within the plaza, which actually consists of two squares: Plaza Muñoz Rivera on the north end, and Plaza Degetau on the southern end. The square is the center of the Ponce Historic Zone , and it is flanked by the historic Ponce City Hall to the south, the early 19th-century Teatro Fox Delicias to the north, the NRHP -listed Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño and Banco de Ponce buildings to the east, and the Armstrong-Poventud Residence to the west. The square dates back to the early Spanish settlement in Ponce of 1670. It is the main tourist attraction of the city, receiving about a quarter of a million visitors per year.\\n\nHistory\nAccording to the traditional Spanish colonial custom, a town\\'s main square, or plaza, was the center of the town. In the case of Ponce, a Catholic church was built on the center of the plaza, thus splitting the plaza into two sections.  The Plaza Las Delicias square is, thus, actually made up of two plazas.  The north section of the square is named Plaza Luis Muñoz Rivera ( Luis Muñoz Rivera square ), while the south section is called Plaza Federico Degetau ( Federico Degetau square ). Plaza Las Delicias measures 8,800 square meters.  \\n\nThe history of Plaza Las Delicias dates back to as far as the creation of the first Catholic chapel in Ponce in 1670.  It is also known that around 1840 Mayor Salvador de Vives planted trees as a renovation project for Plaza Las Delicias.  It was first lit in 1864.  \\n\nIn addition to the cathedral and the firehouse, Plaza Las Delicias at one point also contained an open dining Moorish -style Arab kiosk that had been part of the 1882 Fair Exposition.  The kiosk was still present at the time of the American invasion of the island in 1898 as reported by American photo-journalist William Dinwiddie ,  but it was demolished in 1914.  \\n\nPlaza Luis Muñoz Rivera\nPlaza Luis Muñoz Rivera is the smaller of the two plazas. It is situated to the north of the Ponce Cathedral, and was originally known as Paseo de La Alameda ,  and was at a time also called \"Plaza Las Delicias\" itself,  but today it is known as Plaza Luis Muñoz Rivera.  It is so named to honor the prominent poet, journalist, and politician by that name born in Barranquitas and whose statue stands prominently in the center of this plaza. The statue is the product of the foundry of Italian sculptor Luiggi Tomassi.  in Pietrasanta, Italy.  The Muñoz Rivera statue is made in bronze and was unveiled in 1923. Luis Yordán Dávila , mayor of Ponce at the time, was one of the main proponents of the monument.  In addition to the statue of Munoz Rivera, this section of Plaza Las Delicias also has two fountains.\\n\nPlaza Muñoz Rivera is bounded on the north by Plaza Muñoz Rivera street (also called Reina street and Isabel street), on the west by Union street, on the east by Atocha street , and on the south by the Ponce Cathedral and Parque de Bombas . Two hotels, various banks, several boutiques, a five-story drugstore building (now home to the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico School of Architecture ), and the historic Fox Delicias theater surround this smaller plaza.\\n\nPlaza Federico Degetau\nPlaza Federico Degetau is the larger of the two plazas. It was designed by architect Francisco Porrata-Doria in 1914.  It is located south of the cathedral and the firehouse. It was originally called Antigua Plaza Real (Old Royal Plaza).  This section of Plaza Las Delicias is perhaps the best known and the one most often seen in pictures.\\n\nIn the center of this plaza lies the famous Fuente de los Leones (Lions Fountain). The large, round-shaped fountain is bounded by a low, marmol and granite wall. The fountain\\'s wall boundary is shaped in the form of a regular octagon and built so that one of the vertices of the octagon points towards the historic Ponce City Hall.  The fountain also features four lion statues and water that flows under colored lighting effects.  The four lion statues are located one statue on each alternating vertex of the fountain\\'s octagonal boundary wall.  The fountain was purchased in 1939 at the New York World\\'s Fair .

        "page_content": "Contents\nPlaza Muñoz Rivera\n\\n\nPlaza Muñoz Rivera , formally Plaza Luis Muñoz Rivera , is the smaller of the two plazas at Plaza Las Delicias in the city of Ponce , Puerto Rico . It is located on the north side of Plaza Las Delicias, north of the larger southern Plaza Degetau . The square is notable for its fountains and for the Luis Muñoz Rivera statue . The historic Parque de Bombas and Ponce Cathedral buildings are located immediately to the south of Plaza Muñoz Rivera. The square is at the center of the Ponce Historic Zone , and is flanked by the Armstrong-Poventud Residence to the west, the Teatro Fox Delicias to the north, and Catholic University of Puerto Rico School of Architecture to the east. The square dates back to the early Spanish settlement in Ponce of 1670. It is the main tourist attraction of the city, receiving about a quarter of a million visitors per year.  \\n\nHistory\nAccording to the traditional Spanish colonial custom, a town\\'s main square, or plaza, was the center of the town. In the case of Ponce, a Catholic church was built on the center of the plaza, thus splitting the plaza into two sections: Plaza Muñoz Rivera to the north (the subject of this article) and Plaza Degetau to the south.  Plaza Las Delicias square is, thus, actually made up of two plazas. The north section of the square is named Plaza Luis Muñoz Rivera (Luis Muñoz Rivera square), while the south section is called Plaza Federico Degetau (Federico Degetau square). Plaza Muñoz Rivera measures 2,400 square meters.  \\n\nThe history of the plaza dates back to as far as the creation of the first Catholic chapel in Ponce in 1670.  It is also known that around 1840 Mayor Salvador de Vives planted trees as a renovation project for the plaza.  It was first lit in 1864.  An 1874 map of downtown Ponce shows that this northern plaza (see map/diagram \"Diagram of Plaza Las Delicias\") was already called \"Las Delicias\" while the southern plaza (today\\'s Plaza Degetau ) continued to be called \"Plaza Mayor.\"  When referring to either plaza it is common to just say \"Plaza Las Delicias\". For example, it may be said that the Feria de Artesanías de Ponce is to take place at Plaza Las Delicias, when in effect it takes place at Plaza Degetau;  or to say that Fiestas Patronales are taking place at Plaza Las Delicias when in effect they are centered mostly at Plaza Muñoz Rivera.\\n\nName\nPlaza Luis Muñoz Rivera is situated to the north of the Ponce Cathedral and was originally known as Paseo de La Alameda or, simply, Alameda,  but today it is named after the famed Puerto Rican statesman Luis Muñoz Rivera. It is so named to honor the prominent poet, journalist, and politician by that name born in Barranquitas and whose statue stands prominently in the center of this plaza. The statue is the product of the foundry of Italian sculptor Luiggi Tomassi  in Pietrasanta, Italy.  The Muñoz Rivera statue is made in bronze and was unveiled in 1923. Luis Yordán Dávila , mayor of Ponce at the time, was one of the main proponents of the monument.  In addition to the statue of Munoz Rivera, this section of Plaza Las Delicias also has two fountains.\\n\nLocation\nPlaza Muñoz Rivera is bounded on the north by Plaza Muñoz Rivera street (also called Reina street and Isabel street), on the west by Union street, on the east by Atocha street , and on the south by the Ponce Cathedral and Parque de Bombas . Two hotels, various banks, several boutiques, and the old 3-story Forenza building (now home to the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico School of Architecture ) surround this plaza. It is surrounded by hotels, banks, the Casa Armstrong-Poventud , the Teatro Fox Delicias , and various boutiques and cafes.  \\n\nSetting\nThe plaza has wide mosaic-tile sidewalks, well-manicured flower gardens, well-trimmed bushes and Indian laurel trees, late 1800s lampposts, and numerous marble benches.  The fountain is made of marble and bronze. \\n\nIt is surrounded by a multitude of other historic sites such as Paseo Atocha and the Casa Saurí (now Ponce Ramada Hotel), among others.

It opened in 1982 and is anchored by Marshalls Megastore , Caribbean Cinemas , TJ Maxx , Best Buy , Golden Corral , Pueblo Supermarkets , Chili\\'s Grill & Bar , Walgreens , and PetSmart .\\n\nHistory\nThe 350,000 square foot Plaza Río Hondo at the time was first owned and developed by the firm Wilder-Manley Associates, and represented an investment of $25 million. The mall was also managed by the firm Wilder-Manley of Puerto Rico, Inc., a subsidiary of WMA.   \\n\nOn March 31, 1982, the first group of stores at the mall first opened, of which included Pueblo Supermarkets .  The second few group of stores opened at the end of July of that year. This included Barker\\'s , Woolworth , La Giralda, and many more.   \\n\nIn July 1982, Barker\\'s one of the stores anchoring the mall inaugurated being the chains 16th store on the island.  \\n\nIn November 1982, the mall had inauguration events including things such as fashion shows, exhibitions, and music. These events took place starting on the 5th of that month and ending in December of that year.  The mall opened with 70 stores of which included Barker\\'s , Woolworth , Pueblo Supermarket , Walgreens , Kinney Shoes , Gordon\\'s , Marianne , La Favorita, Centro Disco, Thom McAn , Hallmark , Almacenes Rodríguez, Flagg Shoes, Madison, Preciosa, Butler Shoes, Lerner\\'s, Almacenes Karlo, RadioShack , Baker Shoes , Zales , Rahola, Tiffany Bakery, Land of Oz, Lee Borinquen, Taco Paco, Burger King , Golden Skillet , Almacenes González, La Giralda, and many more. It also featured on opening free parking for over 2,000 cars.  \\n\nOn October 20, 1983, after the acquiring of 5 Barker's stores on the island by the Kmart Corporation ,  a new Kmart store would inaugurate at Plaza Río Hondo in the former Barker's space.  \\n\nOn March 26, 1985, a Ponderosa Steakhouse opened at the mall.  \\n\nOn July 3, 1986, the Rio Hondo Cinemas a 6-screen cinema opened owned by the Caribbean Cinemas chain. It opened with premieres such as Stallone Cobra , The Karate Kid Part II , Off Beat , Poltergeist II: The Other Side , and Psycho III .  \\n\nIn November 1994, it was reported that the then 394,400 square foot mall would remodel and expand under the ownership of Manley Berenson.  Originally, Plaza Río Hondo had a \"large box\" look. The owner characterized the mall as looking like a factory. The goal of this renovation was, to quote the owner, \"to break out of the box.\" The new look which brought forth the remodeling of both the exterior and interior of the mall, consisted of a river theme throughout the whole mall featuring bright, tropical colors, suggesting the tropical landscape and seascape of Puerto Rico. This encouraged the tenants to renovate their own spaces. The center was re-merchandised to meet the needs of all kinds of consumer budgets. Among the new stores were Bostonian, Payless Shoe Source , a bookstore, a GNC Nutrition store, an upscale men\\'s clothing store, and kiosks for cellular telephones, candy and jewelry. Plaza Río Hondo remained open for business during its fast-track construction schedule, which allowed the renovation to be substantially complete for the 1994 Christmas season. These renovations would be fully complete by February 1995. By then the 425,000 square foot mall, would be anchored by a 92,000 square foot Kmart , a 36,000 square foot Woolworth , a 19,700 square foot La Giralda, and a 9,000 square foot Walgreens as a junior anchor.  \\n\nIn 1996, the International Council of Shopping Centers awarded Plaza Río Hondo with the \"International Design and Development Award\" for its layout and style, this was given to the mall after the major renovations it had in 1994 into 1995.   \\n\nIn 1997, the Woolworth store at the mall closed after the chain went under that year.  \\n\nIn late 1998, management Yebba Realty Ventures at the time purchased the lease from F.W. Woolworth Company of their 36,680 square foot store at the mall for $800,000 with the intention of expanding the premises to accommodate the addition of two new junior anchor stores Marshalls and Tiendas Capri.  \\n\nIn April 1998, management at the time Yebba Realty Ventures believed that Plaza Río Hondo required additional food services within the mall. Shortly after the acquisition a long-time tenant, with considerable lease term remaining and a store occupying some 20,000 square feet at the center of the mall began to experience financial difficulties, management immediately entered into negotiations to purchase the lease, which they were able to do for $600,000. A 12-unit food court plus 2 outside facing retail bays were complete at a total cost of approximately $3,645,000. The first year net income generated from the food court was approximately $1,112,280. The total cost of the lease buy-out and food court construction was approximately $4,245,000 thereby equating to a yield on investment of 26.2%. Again applying a 10% cap rate to the net operating income stream, Management created additional net value of $6,877,800. Beyond that, the food court increased the business at the mall.  \\n\nIn 1999, after the redevelopment of the former Woolworth store, both Marshalls and Capri would inaugurate that year. Marshalls, having the highest grossing opening day in the history of the chain on a sales per square foot basis at the time.  \\n\nIn 2001, Yebba Realty Ventures sold the mall to Caribbean Property Group (CPG) for a purchase price of $16,683,080 million dollars.  \\n\n\\nOn June 17, 2004, it was reported that Plaza Río Hondo would soon become home to a Marshalls MegaStore (featuring HomeGoods inside Marshalls store) and CompUSA\\'s flagship store in Puerto Rico , said Martha Hermilla, the mall\\'s marketing manager. \"This year, we are adding a 55,000 square foot space for a Marshalls Mega Store. The space currently occupied by a regular Marshalls will be occupied by CompUSA, which intends this to be its flagship store on the island,\" said Hermilla. Apparel & domestics retailer Marshalls\\' megastore would be a freestanding building on an outparcel beside the Pueblo supermarket . Occupying 33,000 square feet, the regular Marshalls at Plaza Rio Hondo would close. Computer retailer CompUSA\\'s store at Plaza Rio Hondo would be the company\\'s second on the island. The first, occupying 22,000 square feet, was in Guaynabo\\'s Plaza Caparra. Also planned to kick off at Plaza Rio Hondo that year was an expansion of the mall by some 20,000 square feet and the refurbishment of its interiors. \"It is going to be a major renovation,\" said Hermilla. Although she said all construction was to begin in those following few months, she couldn\\'t say when the projects would be completed. Plaza Rio Hondo, at the time occupied 461,989 square feet and had more than 90 stores. The mall\\'s sales per square foot averaged $450; the food court generated per square foot sales averaging of $770. Including Plaza Rio Hondo, PMI Inc. managed 17 properties in Puerto Rico with more than 28,000 parking spaces, more than 5.3 million square feet of gross leasable space, and more than 800 merchants.  \nOn August 19, 2004, it was reported that The Children's Place had plans to open a store at the mall by December of that year.  \\n\nIn December 2004, the mall had more than 90  establishments at the time such as a Big Kmart , Marshalls , Tiendas Capri, Walgreens , Pueblo Xtra , Rave, Rave Girls, 5-7-9 , Tiendas Kress , Click, Marianne, Clubman, Champs Sports , Foot Locker , KB Toys , Payless Shoe Source , GameStop , Radio Shack , Blockbuster , Time Out, GNC , Pearle Vision Center , Zales , Claire's , Rainbow , and others. It would also feature food options such as Burger King , Kentucky Fried Chicken , Ponderosa , Soft & Creamy, Subway , Taco Bell , and others.  \\n\nIn 2005, the mall was acquired by DDR Corp. from a $1.15 billion portfolio deal with Caribbean Property Group (CPG) which included the mall.  \\n\nOn August 4, 2011, TJ Maxx would open a 30,000 square foot store at the mall, replacing the space formerly occupied by a Tiendas Capri.   \\n\nOn January 24, 2012, that the Anna\\'s Linens chain, had plans to open a store in Plaza Río Hondo, the store would occupy a space of 5,600 square feet and the opening was anticipated to be that year.  \\n\nIn 2014, DDR Corp. announced a full remodel of the mall, the changes included new facades and architectural elements that would allow in natural lighting, and the inclusion of expanding the variety of retailers inside of the mall.  \\n\nIn 2017, DDR Corp. spun off its Puerto Rican shopping centers to RVI ( Retail Value Inc. ) due to struggles they had after the Hurricane Maria , making Retail Value Inc. the new owner of the mall at the time.  \\n\nOn November 6, 2019, it was announced that the Kmart store at the mall would be closing in February 2020.  \\n\nIn August 2021, Developers Diversified ( DDR Corp. ) came back to the PR retail landscape with a $550 million deal with RVI of which Plaza Rio Hondo was included in, making DDR the owner of the mall once again.  \\n\nOn May 10, 2023, it was reported that Curzon Puerto Rico, an affiliate of Curzon Advisers, was now the owner of one of the largest shopping center portfolios in Puerto Rico, formerly owned by Developers Diversified ( DDR Corp. ) which had acquired it again in 2021. In this portfolio of 9 shopping centers, Plaza Río Hondo was included, making Curzon Puerto Rico the new owners of the mall.  \\n\nOn January 29, 2024, it was reported that the Aliss department store, located at the mall had begun the process of closing its operations, which would end on that January 31. Regarding Aliss\\' departure from Plaza Río Hondo, Martha E. Hermilla, the senior marketing director of  Curzon Puerto Rico, clarified that it had been a decision by the landlord. However, the company already had a tenant for the space. According to Hermilla, Golden Corral would be occupying the former 13,156-square-foot location of a Grand Stores department store, expanding it to 15,406 square feet. Therefore, Grand Stores would be relocating to the former 7,875 square foot location that Aliss occupied, expanding it to 10,125 square feet.  \\n\nCurrent Anchors\nFormer Anchors\nReferences"

The site was included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000 for its historic importance.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Polvorín was built on orders of Field Marshal Alejandro O\\'Reilly , who visited the island in 1765 to gauge the status of the island defenses on a request of King Charles III . Among O\\'Reilly\\'s recommendations was the construction of five ammunition storage (or polvorín ) to support the other artillery structures on the island. Some accounts state the specific construction date as 1770  and others as 1776.  \\n\nWhen the Spanish-American War ended in 1898, United States took control of the island. From that time until the 1930s, the Polvorín de Miraflores was used as a quarantine station under the administration of the United States Public Health Service . Ship passengers and immigrants were inspected here and, if necessary, were isolated from the population.\\n\nSince the 1940s, the building was repurposed as a chapel for the Isla Grande Naval Base. As a result, some changes were made to the structure, like the replacement of the chimney with a bell tower. The structure was then renamed Santa Bárbara Chapel.\\n\nWhen the Naval Base closed in 1971, the structure was handed to the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture . During this time, it was used as the setting for the San Juan Ballets and the San Juan Children\\'s Choir. Since 1984, it became part of the National Register of Historic Places .\\n\nEventually, the building was taken by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works and the property was used for the storage of vehicles.   With time, the property became abandoned and deteriorated. Recently, the structure was handed to the Convention Center District which prompted the removal of the abandoned vehicles from the property.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The company was located at the intersection of PR-123 and PR-500 , in Barrio Magueyes .  It was founded in 1941  by Antonio Ferré Bacallao, a Puerto Rican industrialist of Cuban origin.  In 1963, the company became the first Puerto Rican company to go public and be listed in the New York Stock Exchange .  \\n\nPonce Cement was part of the Empresas Ferré enterprise from 1941 to 2002. In 1950, Empresas Ferré purchased another cement enterprise, the Puerto Rico Cement Company, then owned by the Government of Puerto Rico.  In 2002, Ponce Cement, Inc., was sold to Cemex , a Mexican business concern that is both the world\\'s largest building materials supplier and the third largest cement producer, of which Ponce Cement is now a subsidiary.  The plant continues to operate at the same location, and continues to sell its products to the Puerto Rico market, but with the change in ownership, the company is no longer named Ponce Cement, Inc. ; it is now Cemex, Puerto Rico .  The new owners did keep the Cemento Ponce product label.  \\n\nHistory\nThe municipality of Ponce was the perfect place to establish a cement plant, as the type of soil needed for cement production is abundant in the region.

        "page_content": "Contents\nPonce City Hall\n\\n\nThe Ponce City Hall  is a historic city hall in Ponce, Puerto Rico . It is located it the center of the city, on Calle Degetau , across from Plaza Degetau in the Ponce Historic Zone . The building serves as the seat of the executive branch of government of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce, including the office of the mayor of Ponce . Built in 1840, it is the oldest colonial building in the city.  The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1986 as Casa Alcaldía de Ponce-City Hall.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Ponce City Hall has one of the most unusual histories of any city hall throughout the world, because it was a jail until the end of the 19th century.  Rooms currently used as offices were jail cells before, and the courtyard of the City Hall was the place where executions took place.  The last public hanging on the island happened in its courtyard.  It has been visited by four U.S. presidents , and three of them actually gave a speech from the City Hall\\'s front balcony: Theodore Roosevelt , Herbert Hoover , and Franklin Roosevelt . George H. W. Bush visited, as well.   \\n\nDesign and construction\nConstruction of the building started in 1844 and was completed in 1847. Engineering and architectural design for the building was directed by Francisco Gil Capó under the oversight of Mayor Salvador de Vives .  The facade is said to be constructed of \"simple but elegant lines.\"  Its large front facade clock was acquired in England in 1877 at the time the city was given its city charter by Queen Isabel II of Spain.  The interior has two courtyards designed in the typical architecture of the time and a spacious stairway leads to the main hall of the Municipal Legislature and the office of the mayor.  \\n\nSignificance\nBy 1848, the population of the Spanish settlement at Ponce had grown sufficiently to merit recognition as a city by Queen Isabel II. The construction of the City Hall coincides with this decree, thus qualifying the building as a landmark to the founding of Ponce.  \\n\nAs the first governmental structure in the city, the building incorporates elements designed to display its authoritative role. In fact, the design is contemporary to the 1848 addition to the Royal Palace ( La Fortaleza ) in San Juan and displays defensive, military characteristics, such as the buttressed street wall, similar to those of the Fortaleza. Most importantly, the vocabulary utilized is purely the Neoclassical Isabelino of the Spanish 19th century, representative of the works performed by the Royal Corps of Engineers of Spain and satisfying the demands of the growing aristocratic population of Ponce.  \\n\nAccording to the Laws of the Indies, established in the 16th century to regulate the colonization of towns in the Americas, a settlement was to be planned around a central plaza, with the Holy Catholic church facing westward and the town hall or \"Cabildo\" (seat of government power) either opposite or adjacent, emphasizing the major and joint role of the church and state in Hispanic society. Located at the southern fringe of the plaza, at the center of the block between Calle Marina and Calle Cristina, the City Hall dominates the street wall between buildings of similar character and demonstrates faithfully the Spanish concept of the urban plaza. Although the interior has been altered during the 20th century in response to the growing needs of the municipal government, the exterior has maintained its individual and contextual integrity. Along with the Catedral de Nuestra Senora de la Guadalupe in the town plaza , the Ponce City Hall forms an essential element of the urban concept of plaza in Ponce, a Spanish colonial town flourishing during the 19th century.  \\n\nPhysical appearance\nThe building is an attached, plastered masonry structure at the south side of the Plaza Degetau, occupying a lot at the center of the block between Calle Marina and Calle Cristina. The building\\'s neoclassical austerity and strong symmetrical character are typical of 19th-century Spanish civil architecture.  \\n\nThe main facade consists of two stories, divided into five bays: a three bay central section flanked by and only slightly projecting single-bay section on either side. At the ground level, a very distinctive feature of the City Hall is the continuous, projecting water table which creates the appearance of a fortification wall. The central entrance consists of a wide rectangular void, framed by an elliptical archivolt molding. This composition is emphasized by a frontispiece consisting of flanking pairs of banded pilasters supporting decorative brackets which, in turn, support a balustered balcony accessed through the second level. The single bay sections have smooth rustication only at the ground floor, terminating at a continuous string course which divides this level from the upper.  \\n\nAll openings other than the main entrance and the second and fourth bays at ground level are articulated with full-height, wooden , double doors with louvre panels. The central entrance houses decorative, wrought-iron railings and its flanking windows begin at a height of approximately four feet. At the upper level bays, baluster rails create balconettes . Planar surrounds frame the window openings, extending above to incorporate separate architrave moldings.  \\n\nA continuous cornice and parapet extend across the facade. A pedimented frontispiece composed of a clock , flanked by pairs of small pairs of Tuscan pilasters , capped by an entablature and supported at either side by a scroll element emphasizes the central bay above the running cornice. In addition, a weathervane rises up above the pediment, further strengthening the symmetrical quality of the facade.  \\n\nUses\nIn addition to government offices, the Ponce City Hall today is the common departing location for a number of other activities and events, including the famous annual Ponce Carnival .  \\n\nLocation\nIt fronts onto the Plaza Las Delicias , the town square of Ponce, which contains the historic Parque de Bombas and the Ponce Cathedral .  The street it is on is called Calle Degetau .\\n\nIn 1986 the property was bounded to the North, 27.16 meters long, by Villa and Comercio streets; to the South, 27.10 meters long, by Luna Street; to the West, 75.00 meters long, by the properties of Moscoso Brothers and a lot owned by Mario Mercado Succession (Estate); and to the East, 79.10 meters long, by the properties Sanchez Frasquero Succession (Estate) and a lot owned by Ponce Municipal Government.  \\n\nToday\nIn 1905 the Ponce City Hall stood above all other surrounding structures.  Today\\'s Ponce City Hall complex includes the adjacent buildings of Moscoso & Co. and El Cometa . The Legislature of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce occupies the old El Cometa building which during the 20th century was home to one of Ponce\\'s largest general stores . The Moscoso addition is used by executive offices of the mayor. The original city hall building is now (in 2010) bounded west by the old Moscoso building which has since been incorporated as Ponce Municipal Government offices, and bounded east by the former El Cometa building which has since also been incorporated by the Municipal Government to become the headquarters of the Legislature of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce. Casa Alcaldia de Ponce holds a painting of Regent Queen of Spain María Cristina de Habsburgo-Lorena .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPonce High School\n\\n\nThe Ponce High School is public educational institution in Ponce, Puerto Rico , offering grades nine through twelve.  The school\\'s main building is a historic structure located on Cristina Street, in the Ponce Historic Zone .  From its beginning the school has secured a unique place in Puerto Rico\\'s educational history. Of over 3,000 schools erected in Puerto Rico in the first quarter of the twentieth century, Ponce High was the largest, \"at a time enrolling more students than all the other Puerto Rico high schools combined\", and for many years enrolling more students than any other high school in Puerto Rico.  The cost of the building in 1915 dollars was $150,000 USD ($4.52 million in 2023 dollars  ).  The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 4 August 1987.  The school has the only diamond-level DECA chapter in Puerto Rico.  The Ponce High School building is \"among the most important public buildings ever built in Puerto Rico.\"  The school is the oldest continuously-operating high school in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nHistory\nThe history of the institution dates back to January 1899. On 25 January 1899 a historic fire took place on the lot currently occupied by the High School.  The fire is known as the \"Fuego del Polvorín\" (the Fire of the Ammunition Depot). At that time the lot was used as a U.S. Army ammunition depot. Today a register marks the location of the fire.  In November 1899, the new American government authorized the establishment of a public secondary school in Ponce modeled after the American school system. In 1903 the Roosevelt Industrial School was built on land where the US military had its munitions depot that caused the fire.  Five years after El Polvorin , in the 1904-1905 timeframe, a two-story building with 12 classrooms was built to accommodate the Ruiz Gandia Grammar School in the same spacious El Polvorin lot. The first class of Ponce High School students formed in 1902.  As new facilities were completed, the students were moved to them. For the 1907-1908 school year another building was built called the McKinley building, and the Ponce High students occupied said facilities as well. Construction of the now-historic Ponce High School building on Cristina Street started in 1915 and the building was inaugurated in 1920.  \\n\nLocation\nThe school is located in barrio Tercero . It faces Cristina street to the north and is bounded on the south by Comercio street ( PR-133 ), on the west by Salud street, and on the east by Trujillo street. Its location is only two blocks from Plaza Las Delicias . It is also diagonally across from the Ponce Free School of Music , the old location of Liceo de Ponce ( Liceo Ponceño ), an early 20th-century girls-only school. It is also one block from Teatro La Perla .\\n\nConstruction and appearance\nThe main and most historical of the buildings faces north. In the back of this building is a large yard paved with concrete.  This backyard contains several other large school buildings.  The main building follows the neoclassical architectural style. The front entry consists of a raised portico and a lobby area. \\nThe school library is located on the first floor and the auditorium is on the second floor.\\n\nAt both Eastern and Western sides of the lobby, and at both levels, L-shaped arcaded hallways lead to the classrooms. Two semi-enclosed patios are thus defined between the library-auditorium wing (much higher and wider) and the identical classroom wings facing East and West. Three sets of stairs are symmetrically laid out in the scheme: one of secondary importance at either side of the lobby; the most public one next to side entrances at the L-shaped circulation wings. A third set of stairs faces the patios and is the only one not to connect to the building\\'s basement where more classrooms are found.  \\n\nThe most continuous side of the E-shaped structure constitutes the front facade ; it is articulated to best reflect and express the internal organization in plan. Sophisticated neoclassical details, although integral to the building\\'s public \"face\", are not used with such insistence anywhere else on the building, except for the lobby, which includes some mouldings, cornices and relatively simple pilaster inlays. Set back from the street, the front facade is enhanced by two small green parterres adjoining the concrete-iron fence and sidewalk. The elevation includes Doric columns and pilasters running two stories high, identical pediments at each end and an escutcheon -like crowning piece with a clock. The latter is dead center over the entrance portico . Concrete flat roofs, an extended parapet and a wide horizontal cornice tie together all the elements, therefore underlining the horizontal continuity of the structure. Fenestration consists mainly of wood louvered windows with glass. Some have been substituted by contemporary metal louvered windows, which are found all over the rest of the building.  \\n\nA most significant feature of Ponce High School is its two-story high, elongated auditorium, which also contains a generous stage area and a U-shaped wood mezzanine supported from the concrete ceiling. Its original lighting fixtures were removed and replaced by fluorescent ones. Classrooms are well lit and ventilated; there are many openings. Walls are plain, having been painted over and over throughout the years. The original wood floor finish is still retained in the library, the auditorium, and many of the classrooms; some have been substituted or changed to concrete. Hallways and stairs are paved in concrete. Vinyl flooring is used at offices. Glazed concrete tile is found at the lobby, where the original iron grilles, of geometrical design, are still in use.\\n\nTwo small lean-to wood and zinc structures were added a few years ago. The auditorium was adapted to air conditioning features, with acoustic ceiling and related fixtures having been added. In spite of it all, and probably, because of the school\\'s imposing scale, well balanced proportions and well-kept classical detailing, the integrity has not yet been lost.  \\n\nSignificance\nPonce High School is one of the five best school buildings built in Puerto Rico at the beginning of the 20th century and one of the most impressive. Between 1900 and 1925 over 3,000 schools were erected on the Island; only four included fully equipped auditoriums (not just assembly rooms) in their design: San Juan\\'s Central High, Luis Muñoz Rivera School in Salinas, Arecibo\\'s own Luis Muñoz Rivera School and Ponce High School. In that sense, these are the most representative examples of school building ideas being developed at the time in the United States by architects of renown, such as Haussander and Perkins of Chicago, Snyder of New York, Cooper of Boston and, especially, William B. Ittner of St. Louis.  \\n\nGiven the date of erection (earlier than for most other public schools built on the Island) Ponce High School emerges, as one of the earlier American government-sponsored construction efforts at such a large scale on the Island. Strikingly significant is the fact that with the choice of building vocabulary (strongly reminiscent of Mc Kim, Mead & White\\'s Pennsylvania Station in New York) the use of the neoclassical style for educational structures was introduced in Puerto Rico. Ponce High School is today one of the most dignified and imposing structures in the city, a fact underlined by its architectural style, scale and overall architectural merits.  \\n\nArchitect\nSo far, the name of the architect for Ponce High School remains a mystery, although many facts point to Adrian C. Finlayson as its designer.  Mr. Finlayson was, at the time, architect of the Insular Government\\'s Interior Department, and was responsible for many other structures of similar use, size and style. As such, he is a key figure on Puerto Rico\\'s architectural development.  Most historians, however, coincide that Finlayson was in fact its architect.  \\n\nSetting\nIts setting \\xe2\\x80\\x94 on a block surrounded by other schools also of architectural merit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 adds to the school\\'s important urban role. The site itself is a historic one, where the U.S. Army barracks were once located, before a fire ravaged the premises. The event is widely remembered in Ponce.  \\n\nPartial list of principals\nAlumni\nSome of the Puerto Rico\\'s most important public figures attended this school: three of Puerto Rico\\'s governors graduated from there. Its auditorium sponsored drama events that were later acknowledged as definitive for the formation of a Puerto Rican theatrical tradition. The auditorium at Ponce High molded those beginnings. In conclusion, the architecture of Ponce High stands out among the Island\\'s built legacy for historic, stylistic, conceptual and symbolic reasons.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPonce Historic Zone\n\\n\nThe Ponce Historic Zone  is a historic district in downtown Ponce, Puerto Rico , consisting of buildings, plazas and structures with distinctive architectures such as Neoclásico Isabelino and the Ponce Creole , a local architectural style developed between the 19th- and early 20th-centuries.  The zone goes by various names, including Traditional Ponce ( Ponce Tradicional ),  Central Ponce ( Ponce Centro ),  Historic Ponce ( Ponce Histórico ),  and Ponce Historic District ( Distrito Histórico de Ponce ).  Although not yet listed in the National Register of Historic Places , the Ponce Historic Zone was added to the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones ( Registro Nacional de Sitios y Zonas Históricas ) on February 2, 1989.  \\n\nLocation\nThe historic zone is located in what is commonly called Ponce Pueblo - the central downtown and oldest area of the city. While there are several roads that lead to it, the most common point of entry is via PR-1 , which becomes the Miguel Pou Boulevard, and then into the one-way Isabel Street, leading to the center of Ponce at the Plaza Las Delicias .  \\n\nIn addition to Plaza Las Delicias, with its unique Parque de Bombas and Nuestra Señora de la Guadalupe Cathedral , the zone includes landmarks such as Ponce City Hall , Armstrong-Poventud Residence , Ponce High School , and Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro . Numerous other attractions in this historic area are listed in the NRHP , such as Banco de Ponce , Casa Paoli , and Casa de la Masacre .  Others, such as Teatro Fox Delicias , Teatro La Perla , Plaza de Mercado , Hotel Meliá , and Paseo Atocha are not listed but possess significant historical value.  Street corners in most of this zone have chamfered corners , typical of Barcelona, Spain .\\n\nA map of the area covered by the Ponce Historic Zone is available (in 2011) from the government of the municipality of Ponce.  \\n\nHistory\nCarmelo Rosario Natal has linked the origins of the Ponce Historic Zone to an event that took place on 8 June 1893. On that date, La Gaceta de Puerto Rico, the insular government\\'s official periodical, published an edict of the Governor of Puerto Rico, Antonio Daban y Ramirez de Arellano, that mandated municipal authorities throughout the Island to divide, for fire control purposes, a town\\'s urban center into three zones: stone-built, build with fire resistant materials, and built with combustible materials. No structure could be built, rebuilt or restored within a minimum of 50 meters from the town\\'s central square unless it was stoned-built or it was to be upgraded to a stone-built structure.  According to Rosario Natal, those were the roots of what almost 70 years later would be called the Ponce Historic Zone.\\n\nOn 20 June 1960, governor Luis Muñoz Marín amended the law regarding historic zones, making it possible for Ponce to be included in such category.  On 6 June 1962, the Zone was officially designated as such, and initially included only the center core of the city, but it was later expanded to include a much larger area.  On that date (6 June 1962) the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña , with the concurrence of the Puerto Rico Planning Board , approved a resolution creating the Zone. The Zone included a list of 22, mostly contiguous areas, including specific buildings, structures, plaza, streets and sectors that were to be preserved. It also included an area in barrio Playa , including the ruins of the old Fuerte de San José .  \\n\nIt was not long before the creation of the Zone was opposed by local developers and the real estate service industry. Ismaro Torruella, president of the Municipal Assembly, who was originally one of the supporters of the creation of the Zone, succumbed to mounting pressure from local developers, business people and realtors and, by 1962, now favored the elimination, or at least the limitation, of the Zone. \"The evidence on this matter is clear. Torruella and his colleagues wanted to make sure the public hearing [of 10 March 1965] was controlled by them.\"  Opposing groups sought to make their voices known to the townspeople at large, not just to the Municipal Government and the ICP , and formed \"Comite de Ciudadanos para el Progreso de Ponce\" (Citizens Committee Ponce\\'s Progress). This committee included prominent businessmen such as Juan Eugenio Candal , Jose Maria Rovira , Gustavo Armstrong , Jose Moscoso , Tito Castro , among several others. To counter this group, supporters of the Historic Zone created their own \"Comite Ponceño Pro Buen Progreso\" (Ponce Citizens\\' Committee for Fair Progress).\" The debates went on for years with many public hearings taking place. Professional urban planning, traffic, and architectural studies, among others, also took place and recommendations were provided. One study categorized the architectural styles in the Historic Zone into seven groups: Neoclassical European , Spanish Colonial , Ponce Creole , Criollo Pueblerino , Criollo Residencial Pueblerino , Neoclassical Creole , and Neoclassical Superior .  \\n\nOn 17 November 2005, then-Governor of Puerto Rico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá , signed Executive Order Number 72, approving the historic Ponce center as a Historic Center of First Order.  \\n\nPlan Ponce en Marcha\nIn the 1990s an intensive $440 million   revitalization project called \" Plan Ponce en Marcha \"  (\"Ponce on the Move Plan\") has increased the city\\'s historic area from 260 to 1,046 buildings.  The Ponce en Marcha project was conceived in 1985 by then governor Rafael Hernández Colón during his second term in La Fortaleza . A significant number of buildings in Ponce are listed in the National Register of Historic Places .  The nonprofit Project for Public Places  listed the historic downtown Ponce city center as one of the 60 of the World\\'s Great Places , for its \"graciously preserved showcase of Caribbean culture\".  The Ponce en Marcha project has given even more form to the definition, establishment, and development of the Ponce Historic Zone. The plan is the result of litigation between the Government of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce and the Government of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nThe Ponce en Marcha plan projects involve several departments of the Government of Puerto Rico:   \\n\nStructures within the historic zone are classified into four categories:  \\n\nThe historic zone itself consists of three distinct sub-zones:  \\n\nIn August 2003, Mayor Cordero favored a measure to exclude Belgica, Claussells, and Cantera \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all poor, low-income communities \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from the historic zone.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n"

It is located at 7843 Calle Nazaret, Urbanizacion Santa Maria .  The structure was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 4 June 2012.  \\n\nHistory\nThe history of the Ponce YMCA dates back to 1917 when the YMCA was organized in San Juan. In 1919 efforts and surveys were made to start YMCA work in Ponce. In 1934, Manuel Bueno became General Secretary of the Puerto Rico YMCA, the first native Puerto Rican to hold the post. Hurricanes in September 1928  and again in 1931, prevented the Ponce work to move forward once more, as money that had been obtained for the International YMCA Committee had to be used by the San Juan YMCA to help towards repairs to the San Juan YMCA building after these storms. In 1934, however, the YMCA of Puerto Rico became self-supporting.  \\n\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s, however, made it very difficult once more to move forward with plans to build a YMCA building in Ponce. The General Secretary, for example, received no salary for six months. As a result of these difficulties, affiliation with various statewide YMCA organizations was sought in 1944, and again in 1947. The Ponce YMCA was founded in 1947, partly as a result of these affiliations.  Its architect was Pedro A. de Castro Gaya, the son of architect Pedro Adolfo de Castro .  On 10 September 1953 the new Ponce YMCA building broke ground. It was inaugurated on 22 February 1955.  \\n\nNational Register of Historic Places\nThe Ponce YMCA was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 4 June 2012.  Its listing was made possible in part for its interior mural by Rafael Rios Rey titled \"El Hombre\" (English: Man).  \\n\nCurrent use\nThe building has been in continuous use since its inauguration, and sees heightened activity during the summer months with the addition of summer camp programs. During the year it caters to children and adolescents. Over 400 children use its programs.  It also holds regular summer camp programs.  The Ponce YMCA oftentimes works in conjunction with the Ponce Region Boy Scout movement in order to help the boys\\' programs with growth.  The building is heavily used for its sports facilities.  The Ponce YMCA executive director in 2019 was Maritza Correa.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

It also has campuses in Arecibo and Mayagüez , as well as a satellite extension in Coamo . It is also home to a School of Law and a School of Architecture .  The university also founded a medical school, Escuela de Medicina de Ponce , in 1977, but in 1980 became an independent entity that eventually became the Ponce Health Sciences University .\\n\nThe Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico was founded in 1948 as Universidad Católica de Santa María ,   but its name was changed to Universidad Católica de Puerto Rico with the graduation of its first class in 1950.  On 25 January 1991, the name was changed again to its current name, after Pope John Paul II bestowed the title of pontifical on the university.  \\n\nHistory\nThe university was founded in spring of 1948 by James E.

It was founded as the Catholic University of Santa María.  \"The name Santa María was chosen to honor the Mother of God and to implore her protection and help.\"  Its first president was Monseñor Vicente Murga.  The original campus consisted of a few classrooms provided by the Capuchin Friars (OFM) and the Sisters of Saint Joseph , catholic clergymen and nuns, respectively, in the Colegio San Conrado in Ponce, a catholic primary educational school. During 1949, the university acquired 118 cuerdas (115 acres) from the Government of Puerto Rico (administered by Autoridad de Tierras ). This plot of land was located south of the city center proper and was, at the time, part of the Ingenio La Reparada sugar cane plantation, and being used to feed Central Mercedita sugar mill.

        "page_content": "Contents\nPrimera Iglesia Metodista Unida de Ponce\n\\n\nThe Primera Iglesia Metodista Unida de Ponce (English: First United Methodist Church of Ponce. Officially, Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church ) was the first structure erected in Puerto Rico by the celebrated architect Antonin Nechodoma .  Constructed in 1907, the building houses a Methodist congregation and is located on Villa street in Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the city\\'s historic district .  The structure was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 29 October 1987.  \\n\nBackground\nUnder the Spanish colonial government (1508  - 1898) religious worship in Puerto Rico was prohibited in other than Catholic churches. With the 1898 change in sovereignty from the Spaniards to the Americans, Protestant churches began to be built. Now (2019) known as Primera Iglesia Metodista La Resurrección , this church was built in 1907 on land that was previously owned by the Vendrell Toro family, a prominent family in Ponce.  In 1962 the church served as the first site of the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico at Ponce ,  until more spacious quarters were established at the intersection of Calle Estrella and Calle Castillo. Today (2019) the church continuous to hold regular worship services. The building is open, free of charge, Tuesday to Friday mornings for the general public; Saturday visits are possible if arrangements are made in advanced.  \\n\nPhysical appearance\nThe First United Methodist Church of Ponce is a magnificent example of early 20th-century eclecticism, integrating Neo-Gothic , Spanish Revival , Spanish Baroque , and byzantine elements.  It is constructed entirely of rusticated, reinforced-concrete with gabled wood and corrugated sheet metal roofs. In volume, the church consists of a gabled single-nave, parallel to the street and subdivided into three sections. A large, central cross-gable creates the main facade at Calle Villa, facing north.  \\n\nOn Calle Villa, the cross-gable is articulated by a Spanish-baroque style rope pediment. Flanking this gabled, central transept are two square-plan towers, a shorter turret on the west and a taller bell-tower on the east, both resting upon the intersections of the main nave and cross-gable. The main gable is divided into three bays: a wide, central bay with a large, wide, four-centered gothic arch stained-glass window and two flanking bays with similar but smaller and narrower stained-glass windows. Above the central bay, a stained glass Spanish-renaissance oculus (consisting of a square with semicircular projections at each of its four sides) occupies the area within the pediment.  \\n\nThe east bell-tower consists of a two-story rusticated base and step-backs to an onion-shaped cupola above the belfry . At the ground level, an entry vestibule is created by an open, four-centered archway. At the second story, still within the tower\\'s rusticated base-section, a series of four narrow, stained-glass strip windows provide a distinct, modernist, element. The first segment of the step-backs of the tower contains two smaller strip windows, and the following, taller set-back houses the church-bell behind narrow arches, one on each of the four sides, supported by Corinthian columns. The onion-cupola caps the composition.  \\n\nThe smaller, west tower is completely rusticated and terminates in a rope pediment, at a level slightly lower than the base of the opposite tower. At the ground level there is a vestibule similar to that of the other tower and above, a circular opening with an oculus within. The main nave extends only one bay beyond the towers. These bays are identical to the smaller stained-glass bays of the main gable. A series of low buttresses supports all major walls, one at each extreme of. each wall.   The side gables of the main nave repeat, exactly, the articulation of the facade of the main cross-gable.  \\n\nA rusticated concrete and wrought-iron gate surrounds the property, articulated by square pillars at approximately 20 foot intervals, and spanned by an approximately 2 foot high rusticated concrete base and bar-like wrought-iron railings above.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Ponce is a very good example of Antonin Nechodoma \\'s religious architecture . This Czech architect was one of the first non-Hispanic designers to work in Puerto Rico. A colleague of Frank Lloyd Wright under Louis Sullivan in Chicago, Nechodoma developed the Puerto Rican Bungalow style for residential housing, which spread rapidly throughout the Island during the 1920s and 1930s. Nechodoma was the architect of at least three Protestant churches and many magnificent prairie -style upper-class residences. Most of Nechodoma\\'s buildings have been demolished because of later developments. Most of his surviving structures are now considered landmarks .  \\n\nNechodoma designed his projects between 1907 and 1928. As the original plans of the church are dated 1907, historians believe that the Methodist Episcopal Church of Ponce was the first structure erected in Puerto Rico by the celebrated architect .  \\n\nThe materials used to construct the church are of importance in the history of construction in Puerto Rico. Reinforced concrete , the principal material, was seldom, if at all, used at this early date in Puerto Rico. Contemporary concrete buildings exhibited a lack of understanding of the then-new material, evidenced by extremely thick walls and excessive use of iron beams (traditional means of construction were applied to modern materials). These characteristics are not found in the construction of this building. Nechodoma used the concrete in an elegant and even decorative fashion, demonstrating his knowledge of North-American construction techniques and his distance from the local building customs. The building looks as if it is made of stone and not concrete.  \\n\nThis church is also important in Puerto Rico\\'s religious history , as it was one of the first non-Roman Catholic churches built after the change of sovereignty in 1898, when the United States established rule. Until then, the only non-Catholic church allowed by Spanish colonial authorities to practice in Puerto Rico had been the Anglican church , organized by British residents. The Methodist Church is an example of the freedom of worship instated after the United States occupation of the island . State Historian Felix Julian del Campo and State Architectural Historian Hector F. Santiago consider it the most prominent non-Catholic structure in the city of Ponce.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPuerta de Tierra, San Juan\nPuerta de Tierra is a subbarrio (subdistrict) occupying the eastern portion of the Islet of San Juan and the barrio of San Juan Antiguo in the municipality of San Juan , Puerto Rico . The name Puerta de Tierra ( Spanish for land gate ) derives from the former eastern gated entrance to the walled city of San Juan where Plaza Colón (formerly Santiago Square, named after the Puerta de Santiago ) is today. With a population of 2,924 as of 2010, this is the most populated area of San Juan Antiguo. On October 15, 2019, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places .  \\n\nHistory\nBefore the arrival of the Europeans to Puerto Rico, Puerta de Tierra (along with Old San Juan) formed part of a smaller islet which was populated by the Taíno . Remains of a small indigenous fishing village have been found where the Puerto Rico National Guard Museum stands today, however most archaeological sites in the area have been destroyed and lost during the construction of the Muñoz Rivera Avenue and surrounding buildings.  \\n\nThe Spanish began the colonization of Puerto Rico in 1508 when Juan Ponce de León founded Caparra , the first permanent settlement in the island, located in the southern part of the Bay of San Juan (today part of Guaynabo ). This Spanish village was abandoned in 1519 when the Spanish founded the settlement of Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista (modern-day Old San Juan) across the bay. The area where Puerta de Tierra is located became critical for the settlement and the defense of the Islet of San Juan as it represented the closest part of the islet to the main island of Puerto Rico. This area, later referred to as El Boquerón , was separated from the main island by the San Antonio strait (today known as the San Antonio Channel). The first bridge across the San Antonio Channel was built by enslaved Taínos between 1520 and 1521 as entrusted by the Order of Saint Jerome (or Hieronymites).  \\n\nOne of the first witch-hunts in the New World occurred in Puerta de Tierra in 1594 when bishop and inquisitor Don Nicolás Ramos accused a group of people of African descent of celebrating pagan rituals just outside of the settlement of San Juan. The accused were tortured and forced to reject their beliefs, although three women who did not comply were burned at the stake by orders of the Holy Inquisition .  \\n\nConstruction of the fortified wall system of San Juan began in 1634. Although the area outside the city walls occupying the east side of Old San Juan was almost uninhabited prior to the 19th century, this area represents the first urban expansion of San Juan during the colonial period. Some of the settlers of the area around this time were freed families originating from the British, Dutch and Danish colonies in the Caribbean. While most residences were wooden huts and bohíos , this represents the first eastward demographic expansion of the colonial city of San Juan. Most of the huts were located along the eastern walls and the Puerta de Santiago (Santiago Gate). Due to the fact that this was the main entrance by land to the fortified city, the gate was referred to as Puerta de Tierra .  \\n\nThe area was further settled after the eastward expansion of the batteries of Fort San Cristóbal in 1771 and the construction of the Camino Real (today the Ponce de León Avenue ) later in 1810. The area was attacked by the British during the 1797 Battle of San Juan under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby and Sir Henry Harvey , during the Coalition Anglo-Spanish War . The British invasion was thwarted by the local Spanish militia and regiments of Afro-Puerto Ricans after an unsuccessful siege of San Juan. This event led to the re-fortification of El Boquerón in the eastern end of Puerta de Tierra. Remnants of these military installations can still be seen today in the Luis Muñoz Rivera Park . By 1838, Puerta de Tierra had a population of 168 residents, mainly of African descent .  \\n\nAlthough the military installations in San Juan were modernized in 1865, the eastern portion of the walls were no longer deemed necessary due to the eastward expansion of the city and were consequently partially demolished. The 1867 Virgin Islands earthquake destroyed the remaining eastern military installations in the area, and a new road and railway station were built with the name of Paseo Virgen de Nuestra de Señora de Covadonga and the Covadonga Terminal, respectively. The Paseo Covadonga exists today under the name of Covadonga Avenue.  The San Juan streetcar system was developed along the Camino Real in 1880, during a time when the southern coast of Puerta de Tierra began to be industrially developed as piers and docks were installed along the San Antonio Channel. During this time, Puerta de Tierra became the most populated area in the Islet of San Juan, which is reflected through the construction of a new parish church ( Church of San Agustín ), bullfight arenas, schools and new streets. Although the area was quickly developing, most of the residential structures were unplanned, something that also happened along the northern walls of the city in La Perla .  \\n\nThe United States took control of Puerto Rico from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 . In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Puerta de Tierra was 5,453. Puerta de Tierra was badly damaged during the path of the San Ciriaco hurricane (also known as the 1899 Puerto Rico Hurricane ).  \\n\nPuerta de Tierra went through large changes during the beginning of the 20th century. Barriada Miranda was the first formally established public residential area in the zone in 1903 along the Camino Real , now called the Carretera Central . Politician Luis Muñoz Rivera suggested in 1907 that the territorial capitol of Puerto Rico should be built in the largest of the empty parcels of land where the eastern city walls used to be, next to the Tapia Theater . The first public elementary school, José Julián Acosta School, was also built here in 1907. The portion of this road that passed through Puerta de Tierra was popularly known as the Broadway of Puerto Rico by the media due to the large number of theaters and cultural performing institutions being built at the time. Tres Banderas Theater, for example, was the first cinema to be established in the area in 1910. Some of the first non-Catholic Christian institutions were also established here in the 1910s such as the first Methodist church and the first Lutheran church in San Juan.  \\n\nThe 1928 Okeechobee hurricane (known locally as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane ) caused approximately 300 deaths in Puerta de Tierra. This and other disasters such as disease outbreaks negatively affected the development of the area in the first half of the 20th century. Puerta de Tierra and its docks were also the site of large and important workers\\' protests during this time. The Second World War , however, brought an increase in the industrial activity in the area. The first use of condominiums as public housing in the United States also occurred during this time in Puerta de Tierra, the first of which was the Condominio San Luis , and multi-level housing soon replaced wooden single-family houses.  \\n\nCityscape\nPuerta de Tierra conforms the eastern portion of the Islet of San Juan and it is connected to the mainland by bridges ( Dos Hermanos and San Antonio ) and a causeway. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, El Boquerón and El Condado to the east, the San Antonio Channel to the south and Old San Juan immediately to the west. Puerta de Tierra is the site of many of Puerto Rico \\'s government buildings, including the Capitol of Puerto Rico . With a 2000 census population of 4,135 and a land area of 0.60 sq. miles (1.55 km\\xc2\\xb2), Puerta de Tierra is the largest and most populous subbarrio of San Juan Antiguo barrio .  \\n\nIn October 2017, Puerta de Tierra won an award from the International Union of Architects , a non-governmental body based in Switzerland which represents the world\\'s architects. Puerta de Tierra was awarded \"best public spaces\".  \\n\nNational Register of Historic Places\nOn October 15, 2019, Puerta de Tierra was officially added to the National Register of Historic Places . According to Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Dia , Bibiana Hernández had worked for decades to have Puerta de Tierra added to the US National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and was overjoyed at the news. Many people such as artist and community spokesman, Jesús \"Bubu\" Negrón , have worked along with Arleen Pabón-Charneco, a Puerto Rican architect and author of the NRHP nomination forms, to bring more visibility to the area.\\n\nThe community expressed concerns saying the area was starting to experience gentrification. This designation now makes the entire Isleta de San Juan (San Juan Islet) a historic district, along with the Old San Juan Historic District (which is also on the small isle) and the designation should make it easier to prioritize its care with federal funds for these purposes. There were already thirteen structures in Puerta de Tierra on the NRHP, including El Falansterio , Brambaugh School and the José Celso Barbosa Graded School .  \\n\nThere is a phrase seen on murals around Puerta de Tierra that says Aquí vive gente (\"People live here\") and the community has been planning to create a museum about Puerta de Tierra.  \\n\nAttractions\nGovernment Service Sites\nNotable people from Puerta de Tierra\nGallery\nSites in and around Puerta de Tierra:\\n\nSee also\n\\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPuerto Rico\n\\n\n\\n\nPuerto Rico [ i ] ( Spanish for 'rich port'; abbreviated PR ),  officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , [ b ] [ j ] is a self-governing Caribbean archipelago and island organized as an unincorporated territory of the United States under the designation of commonwealth . Located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami , Florida , between the Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Lesser Antilles , it consists of the eponymous main island and numerous smaller islands, including Vieques , Culebra , and Mona . With approximately 3.2 million residents , it is divided into 78 municipalities , of which the most populous is the capital municipality of San Juan .  Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government ,  though Spanish predominates.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was settled by a succession of peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago;  these included the Ortoiroid , Saladoid , and Taíno . It was claimed by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 and colonization by Juan Ponce de León in 1508.  Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries. An influx of African slaves and Spaniard settlers, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the island. Within the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain .   By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of indigenous , African , and European elements.   In 1898, following the Spanish-American War , Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States .   \\n\nPuerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, and can move freely between the island and the mainland .  However, Puerto Ricans who do not reside in a U.S. state are disenfranchised from federal elections  and generally do not pay federal income tax .   [ k ] In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico sends a nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress , called a Resident Commissioner , and participates in presidential primaries ; as it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress , which governs it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 . Congress approved a local constitution in 1952, allowing U.S. citizens residing on the island to elect a governor . Puerto Rico\\'s current and future political status has consistently been a matter of significant debate.   \\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, the U.S. government , together with the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company , launched a series of economic projects to develop Puerto Rico into an industrial high-income economy. It is classified by the International Monetary Fund as a developed jurisdiction with an advanced, high-income economy ;  it ranks 40th on the Human Development Index . The major sectors of Puerto Rico\\'s economy are manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals , petrochemicals , and electronics) followed by services (namely tourism and hospitality).  \\n\nEtymology\nPuerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port\".  Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen , a derivation of Borikén , its indigenous Taíno name, which is popularly said to mean \"Land of the Valiant Lord\".    The terms boricua , borinqueño , and borincano are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage,   and derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively.  The island is also popularly known in Spanish as La Isla del Encanto , meaning \"the island of enchantment\".  \\n\nColumbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of Saint John the Baptist , while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico (\"Rich Port City\").  Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city. [ l ] \\n\nThe island\\'s name was changed to Porto Rico by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 .  The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises (also Porto in Italian, French, and Portuguese). The name was changed back to Puerto Rico in 1931 by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila .  [ m ]    \\n\nThe official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\"), while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico .  \\n\nHistory\nThe history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC. At the time of Christopher Columbus \\'s arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Taínos . The Taíno people\\'s numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare.  \\n\nLocated in the northeastern Caribbean, Puerto Rico formed a key part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World . The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.\\n\nIn 1593, Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names. The smallest of the Greater Antilles , Puerto Rico was a stepping-stone in the passage from Europe to Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the northern territories of South America. Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the Spanish-American War , Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World; they served as Spain\\'s final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents. Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 . The decree was printed in Spanish, English and French in order to attract Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers. Free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church .  \\n\nIn 1898, during the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S.\\n\nThe Foraker Act of 1900 established a civil government, ending rule by American generals and the Department of War .  A U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Ortega v. Lara , 202 U.S. 339, 342 (1906), [ n ] involving the Foraker Act and referring to the island as \"the acquired country\", soon affirmed that the U.S. Constitution applied within its territory and that any domestic Puerto Rican laws which did not conflict with it remained in force.  \\n\nThe Jones Act of 1917, which made Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens , paved the way for the drafting of Puerto Rico\\'s Constitution and its approval by Congress and Puerto Rican voters in 1952. However, the political status of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth controlled by the U.S., remains an anomaly.\\n\nIn 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the U.S. government to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.  In November 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with the general elections.   The first question, voted on in August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution. 54% voted against the status quo, effectively approving the second question to be voted on in November. The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association .  61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and 5.49% for independence.  [ failed verification ] \\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 5278: PROMESA , establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rican government. This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations. In particular, the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government\\'s constitutional power to \"make all needful rules and regulations\" regarding U.S. territories; The president would appoint all seven voting members of the board; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico\\'s legislature, governor, and other public authorities.  \\n\nPuerto Rico held its statehood referendum during the 3 November 2020 general elections; the ballot asked one question: \"Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State ?\" The results showed that 52 percent of Puerto Rico voters answered yes.  \\n\nGeography\nPuerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands, including Vieques , Culebra , Mona , Desecheo , and Caja de Muertos . Of these five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round. Mona, which has played a key role in maritime history, is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources .  There are many other even smaller islets , like Monito , located near Mona,  and Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan , both located on the San Juan Bay . The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra , which are connected to the main island by bridges.   \\n\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 5,320 square miles (13,800 km 2 ), of which 3,420 sq mi (8,900 km 2 ) is land and 1,900 sq mi (4,900 km 2 ) is water.  Puerto Rico is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island but smaller than Connecticut . The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 110 mi (180 km), and the maximum width from north to south is 40 mi (64 km).  Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles . It is 80% of the size of Jamaica ,  just over 18% of the size of Hispaniola and 8% of the size of Cuba, the largest of the Greater Antilles.  \\n\n\\nThe topography of the island is mostly mountainous with large flat areas in the northern and southern coasts. The main mountain range that crosses the island from east to west is called the Cordillera Central (also known as the Central Mountain Range in English). The highest elevation in Puerto Rico, Cerro de Punta 4,390 feet (1,340 m),  is located in this range. Another important peak is El Yunque , one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest , with an elevation of 3,494 ft (1,065 m). \nPuerto Rico has 17 lakes, all man-made, and more than 50 rivers , most of which originate in the Cordillera Central.  Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south, since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions.\\n\nPuerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks, overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks .  Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old ( Jurassic ) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm.\\n\nPuerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American Plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis . These seismic events, along with landslides , represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The 1918 San Fermín earthquake occurred on 11 October , 1918 and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale .  It originated off the coast of Aguadilla , several kilometers off the northern coast, and was accompanied by a tsunami . It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses, damaging infrastructure, especially bridges. It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4 million in property damage. The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party . On 7 January 2020,  the country experienced its largest earthquake since 1918,  estimated at magnitude 6.4.  Economic losses were estimated to be more than $3.1 billion.  \\n\nThe Puerto Rico Trench , the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic, is located about 71 mi (114 km) north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates.  It is 170 mi (270 km) long.  At its deepest point, named the Milwaukee Deep , it is almost 27,600 ft (8,400 m) deep.  The Mona Canyon , located in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, is another prominent oceanic landform with steep walls measuring between 1.25 and 2.17 miles (2.01 and 3.49 km) in height from bottom to top.  \\n\nThe climate of Puerto Rico in the K\\xc3\\xb6ppen climate classification is mostly tropical rainforest . Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near 85 °F (29 °C) in lower elevations and 70 °F (21 °C) in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season , which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March. The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances. The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects, adding to the climatic variation. Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas.\\n\nBetween the dry and wet seasons, there is a temperature change of around 6 °F (3.3 °C). This change is due mainly to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean , which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal water temperatures during the year are about 75 °F (24 °C) in February and 85 °F (29 °C) in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was 110 °F (43 °C) at Arecibo ,  while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40 °F (4 °C) in the mountains at Adjuntas , Aibonito , and Corozal .  The average yearly precipitation is 66 in (1,676 mm).  \\n\nPuerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season , similar to the rest of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean. On average, a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones , which are more prevalent during periods of La Niña than El Niño .  A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico, on average, every five years. A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island, on average, every seven years. Since 1851, the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane (also known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane in Puerto Rico) of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane.  \\n\nIn the busy 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Puerto Rico avoided a direct hit by the Category 5 Hurricane Irma on 6 September 2017, as it passed about 60 mi (97 km) north of Puerto Rico, but high winds caused a loss of electrical power to some one million residents. Almost 50% of hospitals were operating with power provided by generators.  The Category 4 Hurricane Jose , as expected, veered away from Puerto Rico.  A short time later, the devastating Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday, 20 September, near the Yabucoa municipality at 10:15 UTC (6:15 am local time) as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 155 mph (249 km/h), powerful rains and widespread flooding causing tremendous destruction, including the electrical grid, which would remain out for 4-6 months in many portions of the island.    \\n\nIn 2019, Hurricane Dorian became the third hurricane in three years to hit Puerto Rico. The recovering infrastructure from the 2017 hurricanes, as well as new governor Wanda Vázquez Garced , were put to the test against a potential humanitarian crisis.   Tropical Storm Karen also caused impacts to Puerto Rico during 2019.  \\n\nClimate change has had large impacts on the ecosystems and landscapes of the US territory Puerto Rico. According to a 2019 report by Germanwatch , Puerto Rico is the most affected by climate change. The territory\\'s energy consumption is mainly derived from imported fossil fuels .   \\n\nThe Puerto Rico Climate Change Council (PRCCC) noted severe changes in seven categories: air temperature, precipitation, extreme weather events, tropical storms and hurricanes, ocean acidification , sea surface temperatures, and sea level rise .  \\n\nClimate change also affects Puerto Rico\\'s population, the economy, human health, and the number of people forced to migrate.\\n\nPuerto Rico is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Puerto Rican moist forests , Puerto Rican dry forests , and Greater Antilles mangroves .  Puerto Rico has two biosphere reserves recognized by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme : Luquillo Biosphere Reserve represented by El Yunque National Forest and the Guánica Biosphere Reserve .\\n\nSpecies endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 amphibians / reptiles , recognized as of 1998. Most of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island.  The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí , a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, from which it gets its name. Most coquí species (13 of 17) live in the El Yunque National Forest ,  the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. Forest Service system, located in the northeast of the island. It was previously known as the Caribbean National Forest. El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic to the island. It is also home to 50 bird species, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon .\\n\nIn addition to El Yunque National Forest, the Puerto Rican moist forest ecoregion is represented by protected areas such as the Maricao and Toro Negro state forests . These areas are home to endangered endemic species such as the Puerto Rican boa ( Chilabothrus inornatus ), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk ( Accipiter striatus venator ), the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk ( Buteo platypterus brunnescens ) and the elfin woods warbler ( Setophaga angelae ). The Northern Karst country of Puerto Rico is also home to one of the remaining rainforest tracts in the island, with the Río Abajo State Forest being the first focus for the reintroduction of the highly endangered Puerto Rican parrot outside of the Sierra de Luquillo.   \\n\nIn the southwest, the Guánica State Forest and Biosphere Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals, including 48 endangered species and 16 that are endemic to Puerto Rico, and is considered a prime example of the Puerto Rican dry forest ecoregion and the best-preserved dry forest in the Caribbean.  Other protected dry forests in Puerto Rico can be formed within the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge complex at the Cabo Rojo , Desecheo , Culebra and Vieques National Wildlife Refuges , and in the Caja de Muertos and Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserves .  Examples of endemic species found in this ecoregion are the higo chumbo ( Harrisia portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican crested toad ( Peltophryne lemur ), and the Mona ground iguana ( Cyclura stejnegeri ), the largest land animal native to Puerto Rico.  \\n\nPuerto Rico has three of the seven year-long bioluminescent bays in the Caribbean: Laguna Grande in Fajardo , La Parguera in Lajas and Puerto Mosquito in Vieques . These are unique bodies of water surrounded by mangroves that are inhabited by the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense .   However, tourism, pollution, and hurricanes have highly threatened these unique ecosystems.  \\n\nGovernment and politics\nPuerto Rico has a republican form of government based on the American model , with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States.   All governmental powers are delegated by the United States Congress , with the head of state being the president of the United States . As an unincorporated territory , Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S. Constitution.  \\n\nThe government of Puerto Rico is composed of three branches. The executive is headed by the governor , currently Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia . The legislative branch consists of the bicameral Legislative Assembly , made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber; the Senate is headed by a president , currently José Luis Dalmau , while the House is headed by the speaker of the House , currently Tatito Hernández . The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years, with the last election held in November 2020 . The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , currently Maite Oronoz Rodríguez . Members of the judiciary are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.\\n\nPuerto Rico is represented in the U.S. Congress by a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives, the resident commissioner , currently Jenniffer González . Current congressional rules have removed the commissioner\\'s power to vote in the Committee of the Whole , but the commissioner can vote in committee.  \\n\nPuerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico .   Residents of Puerto Rico, including other U.S. citizens, cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, but can vote in primaries . Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state or Washington, D.C. can vote in presidential elections.\\n\nPuerto Rico has eight senatorial districts , 40 representative districts , and 78 municipalities ; there are no first-order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government. Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios , and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term. The municipality of San Juan is the oldest, founded in 1521;  the next earliest settlements are San Germán in 1570, Coamo in 1579, Arecibo in 1614, Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692. Increased settlement in the 18th century saw 30 more communities established, following 34 in the 19th century. Six were founded in the 20th century, the most recent being Florida in 1971.  \\n\nSince 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The three parties stand for different political status. The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island\\'s status with the U.S. as a commonwealth , while the PNP seeks to make Puerto Rico a U.S. state . Meanwhile, the PIP seeks to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation free from U.S. authority. In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the PIP holds about 5%.\\n\nAfter 2007, other parties emerged on the island. The first, the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party was registered that same year. The party claims that it seeks to address the islands\\' problems from a status-neutral platform. But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election. Four years later, the 2012 election saw the emergence of the Movimiento Unión Soberanista (English: Sovereign Union Movement) and the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador (English: Working People\\'s Party) but none obtained more than 1% of the vote.\\n\nOther non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , the Socialist Workers Movement , and the Hostosian National Independence Movement .\\n\nThe nature of Puerto Rico\\'s political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Congress, and the United Nations .  Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain an unincorporated territory of the U.S., become a U.S. state, or become an independent country.  \\n\nConstitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution .  Laws enacted at the federal level in the U.S. apply to Puerto Rico as well, regardless of its political status. Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress . Puerto Rico lacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation\", for example, the power to manage its \"external relations with other nations\", which is held by the U.S. federal government. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".  \\n\nPuerto Ricans \"were collectively made U.S. citizens\" in 1917 as a result of the Jones-Shafroth Act .  U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, though both major parties, Republican and Democratic, hold primary elections in Puerto Rico to choose delegates to vote on the parties\\' presidential candidates. Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and not a U.S. state, the U.S. Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.   \\n\nOnly fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans. Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and, since 1917, they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft when it has been in effect.\\n\nThough the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, residents of Puerto Rico, contrary to a popular misconception, do pay U.S. federal taxes: customs taxes (which are subsequently returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury), import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes, social security taxes, etc. Residents pay federal payroll taxes , such as Social Security and Medicare , as well as Commonwealth of Puerto Rico income taxes. All federal employees, those who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S., and some others, such as Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military, and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico also pay federal income taxes. In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because \"the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments.\"        \\n\nIn 2009, Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury .  Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement. They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income , and the island receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state.  Also, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system.  \\n\nPuerto Rico\\'s authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states. Thus, individuals committing a crime can only be tried in federal or territorial court, otherwise it would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.  \\n\nIn 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations.\\n\nMany federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico, just as in any state, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Federal Emergency Management Agency , Transportation Security Administration , Social Security Administration , and others. While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment. Sonia Sotomayor , a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent , serves as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions, including serving as U.S. ambassadors to other nations.\\n\nUnlike the vast majority of U.S. states, Puerto Rico has no first-order administrative divisions akin to counties , but has 78 municipalities or municipios as the secondary unit of administration; for U.S. Census purposes, the municipalities are considered county equivalents . Municipalities are subdivided into barrios , and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for four-year terms, per the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991 .\\n\nPuerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution and is thus restricted on how it can engage with other nations, sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one. As is the case with state governments, it has established several trade agreements with other nations, particularly with Latin American countries such as Colombia and Panamá.   \\n\nIt has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries, all Spanish-speaking, and within the U.S. itself, which now include Spain, the Dominican Republic, Panama , Colombia , Washington, D.C. , New York City and Florida, and has included in the past offices in Chile , Costa Rica , and Mexico . Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State; most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the U.S. and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states. Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries, mainly from the Americas and Europe, with most located in San Juan.  \\n\nAt the local level, Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico , an executive department , headed by the secretary of state of Puerto Rico , who also serves as the unincorporated territory\\'s lieutenant governor. It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration , along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner , manages all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the U.S. (including the federal government of the U.S., local and state governments of the U.S., and public or private entities in the U.S.). [ citation needed ] \\n\nBoth entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington, D.C.-based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico\\'s foreign affairs, such as the U.S. Department of State, the Agency for International Development , and others. The current secretary of state is Larry Seilhamer Rodríguez from the New Progressive Party, while the current director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Jennifer M. Stopiran also from the NPP and a member of the Republican Party of the U.S. [ citation needed ] \\n\nThe resident commissioner of Puerto Rico , the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government, including the U.S. Congress, sits in the U.S. House of Representatives, serves and votes on congressional committees, and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The current resident commissioner is Jenniffer González-Colón , a Republican, elected in 2016. She received more votes than any other official elected in Puerto Rico that year.  \\n\nMany Puerto Ricans have served as U.S. ambassadors to different nations and international organizations, such as the Organization of American States , mostly but not exclusively in Latin America. For example, Maricarmen Aponte, a Puerto Rican and now an acting assistant secretary of state, previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador .  \\n\nAs it is an unincorporated U.S. territory, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the U.S. as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the U.S. as its commander-in-chief . Puerto Rico has its own National Guard , and its own state defense force , the Puerto Rico State Guard , which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\\n\nThe commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico adjutant general , currently Major General José J. Reyes . The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole.\\nU.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command (LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM), which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic. Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM\\'s mission until 1999, when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as U.S. Joint Forces Command . Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of U.S. Northern Command .\\n\nBoth the Naval Forces Caribbean (NFC) and the Fleet Air Caribbean (FAIR) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean. With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities, the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico, except for the ships that steam by, and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan , the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards, and the U.S. Coast Guard . Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base. This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300 million.  \\n\nA branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico - known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard - which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of different U.S. states, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard - known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard - which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states.\\n\nAt different times in the 20th century, the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico.  The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba , the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) on Vieques , the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas , Fort Allen in Juana Diaz , the Army\\'s Fort Buchanan in San Juan, the former U.S. Air Force\\'s Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla, and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard\\'s Muñiz Air National Guard Base in San Juan .  \\n\nThe former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads, Vieques, and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government. Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities, there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico: the U.S. Army\\'s small Ft. Buchanan (supporting local veterans and reserve units) and the PRANG (Puerto Rico Air National Guard) Muñiz Air Base (the C-130 Fleet). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations, but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico - such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there.\\n\nPuerto Ricans have participated in many U.S. military conflicts, including the American Revolution , when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba , and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de Gálvez (1746-1786).  They continue to be disproportionately represented in present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .  The most notable example is the 65th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army, nicknamed The Borinqueneers, from the original Taíno name of the island (Borinquen). The all- Puerto Rican regiment participated in World War I , World War II , the Korean War , and the War on Terror ; in 2014, it was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for its heroism during the Korean War.\\n\nA significant number of Puerto Ricans serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, largely as National Guard members and civilian employees. The size of the overall military-related community is estimated to be 100,000, including retired personnel.  Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel. In addition, approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards, or the U.S. Reserve forces.  \\n\nThe insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems.\\n\nPuerto Rico is the only current U.S. jurisdiction whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English: namely, Spanish . Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English, all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts , and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.  [ original research? ] \\n\nTitle 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the U.S. Code to U.S. territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico. After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California . Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary, several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code .\\n\nThe judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court , which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico .  There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico , and someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court, and vice versa, since Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does.  Such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy .\\n\nThe homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014.   Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80% of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related.  \\n\nIn 1992, the FBI made armed carjacking a federal crime and rates decreased per statistics,  but as of 2019, the problem continued in municipalities like Guaynabo and others.      From 1 January 2019 to 14 March 2019, thirty carjackings had occurred on the island.  \\n\nEconomy\nPuerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .  It is considered the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum and ranks highly on the Human Development Index . According to World Bank , gross national income per capita in Puerto Rico in 2020 was $21,740.  Puerto Rico\\'s economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics) followed by services (primarily finance, insurance, real estate and tourism ); agriculture represents less than 1% of GNP.  [ o ] [ p ] In recent years, it has also become a popular destination for MICE ( meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions ), with a modern convention center district overlooking the Port of San Juan .  \\n\nResponsibility for San Juan port inspections lies with PPQ .  So high is the volume of cargo traffic that between 1984-2000 the San Juan PPQ station recorded 7.74% of all interceptions , #4 in the country, #2 for insects and #3 for pathogens .  Most species are originally from South America or elsewhere in the Caribbean due to PR\\'s position as an intermediary on the way to the mainland.  This is one of the worst locations for cut flowers and other plant parts - both in terms of number of problems and diversity of species - for insects in plant parts in baggage , and for pathogens in plant parts in baggage and cargo.  Pathogen interceptions were dramatically (17%) higher 1999-2000 than in 1985-1986.  \\n\nPuerto Rico\\'s geography and political status are both determining factors for its economic prosperity, primarily due to its relatively small size; lack of natural resources and subsequent dependence on imports ; and vulnerability to U.S. foreign policy and trading restrictions, particularly concerning its shipping industry .\\n\nPuerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by four quarters of economic growth, and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico. This IRS section was critical to the economy, as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time, without paying federal tax on corporate income. Puerto Rico has been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the world.  \\n\nAcademically, most of Puerto Rico\\'s economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired, have been repealed, or no longer apply to Puerto Rico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history; [ q ] its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power ; [ r ] as well as its highly inefficient local government [ s ] [ t ] which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout time. [ u ] [ v ] Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion (equivalent to 103% of GNP), and a government deficit of $2.5 billion.   \\n\nBy American standards, Puerto Rico is underdeveloped: It is poorer than Mississippi, the poorest state of the U.S., with 41% of its population below the poverty line . [ w ] However, it has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America. Puerto Rico\\'s main trading partners are the United States, Ireland , and Japan , with most products coming from East Asia , mainly China , Hong Kong , and Taiwan . Puerto Rico\\'s dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation, as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials, makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate .\\n\nTourism in Puerto Rico is also an important part of the economy. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure, disrupting tourism for many months. The damage was estimated at $100 billion. An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal.  By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up to 10% of Puerto Rico\\'s GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.  \\n\nA tourism campaign was launched by Discover Puerto Rico in 2018 intended to highlight the island\\'s culture and history, branding it distinct, and different from other Caribbean destinations. In 2019, Discover Puerto Rico planned to continue that campaign.  \\n\nIn early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion.  The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession.  \\n\nThe Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts, including bonds, since 2015. With debt payments due, the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system.   \"Without action before April, Puerto Rico\\'s ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico\", according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also said that \"Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico\\'s inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\"  \\n\nInitially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico\\'s governor Ricardo Rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by 28 January. Just before that deadline, the control board gave the Commonwealth government until 28 February to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to 31 May.  It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA .  An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rosselló government, with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt.  \\n\nIn early August 2017, the island\\'s financial oversight board (created by PROMESA) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees, down from the original plan of four days per month; the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings. Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary. Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.  \\n\nPuerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S.$9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion, creating a structural deficit of $775 million (about 7.9% of the budget).  The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 24 consecutive years starting in 2000. Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased Puerto Rico\\'s cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973. [ x ]  \\n\nProjected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71B or about 70% of Puerto Rico\\'s gross domestic product. This sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after Puerto Rico\\'s general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade (\"junk status\") by three credit-rating agencies. In terms of financial control, almost 9.6%\\xe2\\x80\\x94or about $1.5 billion\\xe2\\x80\\x94of Puerto Rico\\'s central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service. [ y ] Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the coming years. [ needs update ] \\n\nFor practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a \"general budget\" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico , and the \"consolidated budget\" which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget, by Puerto Rico\\'s government-owned corporations , by revenue expected from loans, by the sale of government bonds, by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States , and by other funds.\\n\nBoth budgets contrast each other drastically, with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently $29B and $9.0B respectively. Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budget.\\n\nThe critical aspects come from the sale of bonds, which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget - a ratio that increased annually due to the government\\'s inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses. In particular, the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt, as none is self-sufficient. For example, in FY2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) reporting losses of $409M, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island) reporting losses of $272M, while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island) reported losses of $112M.  \\n\nLosses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of Puerto Rico\\'s entire public debt today.  Holistically, from FY2000-FY2010 Puerto Rico\\'s debt grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% while GDP remained stagnant.  This has not always provided a long-term solution. In early July 2017 for example, the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9 billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek Court protection.  \\n\nThe cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade. [ z ]        \\n\nStatistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs, such as the high cost of electricity, which has hovered in the 24\\xc2 2 to 30\\xc2 2 range per kilowatt-hour, two to three times the national average, increased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers \"outside the continental United States\". While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories.\\n\nThe household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau\\'s 2015 update. The report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level.  The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S.$100,000 to U.S.$214,000, while the national median home value sits at $119,600. [ aa ] \\n\nOne of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 , also known as the Jones Act , which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports, a practice known as cabotage .  Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America , Western Europe , and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.  The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success. [ ab ] \\n\nIn 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that \"repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs\" and that \"shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs\". [ ac ] [ ad ] Ultimately, the report concluded that \"[the] effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain\" for both Puerto Rico and the U.S., particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the U.S.   A 2018 study by economists at Boston-based Reeve & Associates and Puerto Rico-based Estudios Tecnicos has concluded that the 1920 Jones Act has no impact on either retail prices or the cost of living on Puerto Rico.  \\n\nCities and towns in Puerto Rico are interconnected by a system of roads, freeways , expressways , and highways maintained by the Highways and Transportation Authority under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation , and patrolled by the Puerto Rico Police Department . The island\\'s San Juan metropolitan area is served by a public bus transit system and a metro system called Tren Urbano (\\'Urban Train\\'). Other forms of Puerto Rican public transport include seaborne ferries that serve Puerto Rico\\'s archipelago as well as carros públicos ( private mini buses ).\\n\nPuerto Rico has three international airports , the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Carolina , Mercedita International Airport in Ponce, and the Rafael Hernández International Airport in Aguadilla, and 27 local airports. The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport is the largest aerial transportation hub in the Caribbean.  \\n\nPuerto Rico has nine ports in different cities across the main island. The San Juan Port is the largest in Puerto Rico, and the busiest port in the Caribbean and the 10th busiest in the United States in terms of commercial activity and cargo movement, respectively.  The second largest port is the Port of the Americas in Ponce, currently under expansion to increase cargo capacity to 1.5 million twenty-foot containers ( TEUs ) per year.  \\n\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA, Spanish : Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, AEE )\\xe2\\x80\\x94is an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation , power transmission , and power distribution in Puerto Rico.  PREPA was, by law, the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly until 2018. The Authority is ruled by a governing board appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico , and is run by an executive director.\\n\nOn 20 July 2018, Puerto Rico Law 120-2018 ( Ley para Transformar el Sistema Eléctrico de Puerto Rico ) was signed. This law authorized PREPA to sell infrastructure and services to other providers. As a result, a contract was signed on 22 June 2020, making LUMA Energy the new operator of the energy distribution and transmission infrastructure, as well as other areas of PREPA\\'s operations, in effect partially privatizing the Puerto Rican power grid. The takeover was set for 1 June 2021, amidst protests and uncertainty from the point of view of the general public and the former-PREPA workers and union members .   \\n\nSimilarly, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA, Spanish : Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, AAA )\\xe2\\x80\\x94is a water company and the government-owned corporation responsible for water quality , management , and supply in Puerto Rico.  It is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly. Its existence is designated by Law No. 40 of 1 May 1945, including the corresponding amendments.  \\n\nTelecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  As of 2007 [update] , there were 30 TV stations, 125 radio stations and roughly 1 million TV sets on the island. Cable TV subscription services are available, and the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service also broadcast on the island.  Puerto Rico also has its own amateur radio prefixes , which differ from those of the contiguous United States in that there are two letter before the number. The most well-known prefix is KP4, but others separated for use on the archipelago (including Desecheo and Mona) are: KP3/KP4/NP3/NP4/WP3/WP4 (Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra ) and KP5/NP5/WP5 ( Desecheo Island ).  Amateur radio operators (also known as ham radio operators) are a well-known group in the island and can obtain special vehicle license plates with their callsign on them.  They have been a key element in disaster relief.  \\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Puerto Rico has been shaped by initial Amerindian settlement , European colonization , slavery , economic migration, and Puerto Rico\\'s status as unincorporated territory of the United States.\\n\nThe most populous municipality is the capital, San Juan , with 342,259 people based on the 2020 Census .  Other major cities include Bayamón , Carolina , Ponce , and Caguas . Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered San Juan\\'s metropolitan area , while the other two are located in the south ( Ponce ) and west ( Mayagüez ) of the island.\\n\nPuerto Rico was 98.9% Hispanic or Latino in 2020, of that 95.5% were Puerto Rican and 3.4% were Hispanic of non-Puerto Rican origins. Only 1.1% of the population was non-Hispanic.  The population of Puerto Rico according to the 2020 census was 3,285,874, an 11.8% decrease since the 2010 United States Census .  The commonwealth\\'s population peaked in 2000, when it was 3,808,610, before declining (for the first time in census history) to 3,725,789 in 2010.  Emigration due to economic difficulties and natural disasters, coupled with a low birth rate, have caused the population decline to continue in recent years.  \\n\nCensuses of Puerto Rico were completed by Spain in 1765, 1775, 1800, 1815, 1832, 1846 and 1857, yet some of the data remained untabulated and was not considered reliable according to Irene Barnes Taeuber , an American demographer who worked for the Office of Population Research at Princeton University .  \\n\nContinuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 to almost a million by the close of the 19th century. A census conducted by royal decree on 30 September 1858, gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time: 341,015 were free colored ; 300,430 were white ; and 41,736 were slaves .  A census in 1887 found a population of around 800,000, of which 320,000 were black.  \\n\nDuring the 19th century, hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia , Asturias , Galicia and the Balearic Islands and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain\\'s former colonies in South America. Settlers from outside Spain also arrived in the islands, including from Corsica , France , Lebanon , Portugal , Ireland , Scotland , Germany and Italy . This immigration from non-Hispanic countries was the result of the Real Cédula de Gracias de 1815 ( Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 ), which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island, provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church.\\n\nBetween 1960 and 1990, the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity. The 2000 United States Census included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico. According to the census, most Puerto Ricans identified as white and Latino; few identified as black or some other race.\\n\nA Pew Research survey indicated an adult literacy rate of 90.4% in 2012 based on data from the United Nations .  \\n\nPuerto Rico has a life expectancy of approximately 82.1 years according to the CIA World Factbook, an improvement from 78.7 years in 2010.  \\n\nThe vast majority of recent immigrants, both legal and illegal, come from Latin America , over half come from the Dominican Republic . Dominicans represent 53% of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics, about 1.8% of Puerto Rico\\'s population.  Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic,   and Cuba [ citation needed ] , use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the U.S. mainland. Other major sources of recent immigrants include Cuba , Colombia , Mexico , Venezuela , Haiti , Honduras , Panama , Ecuador , Spain , and Jamaica .   Additionally, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico from the U.S. mainland, majority of which are White Americans and a smaller number are Black Americans . In fact, non-hispanic people represent 1.1% and majority of them are from the U.S. mainland. Smaller numbers of U.S. citizens come from the U.S. Virgin Islands . There are also large numbers of Nuyoricans and other stateside Puerto Ricans coming back, as many Puerto Ricans engage in \\'circular migration\\'.  Small numbers of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics in Puerto Rico are actually American-born migrants from the mainland U.S. and not recent immigrants. Most recent immigrants settle in and around the San Juan metropolitan area.\\n\nEmigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history. Starting soon after World War II , poverty, cheap airfares, and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the U.S. mainland, particularly to the northeastern states and nearby Florida .  This trend continued even as Puerto Rico\\'s economy improved and its birth rate declined. Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of \" circular migration \", with some migrants returning to the island. In recent years, the population has declined markedly, falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% (36,000 people) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration.  The impact of hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017, combined with the unincorporated territory\\'s worsening economy, led to its greatest population decline since the U.S. acquired the archipelago.\\n\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. census , the number of Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico in the U.S. is almost twice as many as those living in Puerto Rico.  As those who leave tend to be better educated than those who remain, this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico\\'s economy.\\n\nBased on 1 July 2019 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau , the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 532,095 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated.  \\n\nThe official languages  of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico  are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law.  However, all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population.  \\n\nOut of people aged five and older, 94.3% speak only Spanish at home, 5.5% speak English, and 0.2% speak other languages.  \\n\nIn Puerto Rico, public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English.  English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant, Puerto Rican Sign Language .\\n\nThe Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Taíno words, as well as English words. The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands . Taíno loanwords are most often used in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena, and native musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music, and dances, particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans.  \\n\nReligious affiliation in Puerto Rico (2014)   \\n\nCatholicism was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico , were authorized by Pope Julius II in 1511.  In 1512, priests were established for the parochial churches. By 1759, there was a priest for each church.  One Pope, John Paul II , visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are located at the town center, or plaza .\\n\nProtestantism , which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, has reemerged under U.S. rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Santísima Trinidad , was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872.  It was the first non-Catholic church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas .   \\n\nPollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38% Roman Catholic, 28% Pentecostal, and 18% were members of independent churches, which would give a Protestant percentage of 46% if the last two populations are combined. Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people. Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants:\\n\nPuerto Rico, by virtue of its long political association with the United States, is the most Protestant of Latin American countries, with a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of whom are Pentecostal . David Stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960 to 1985 for another twenty-five years Puerto Rico will become 75 percent evangelical. (Ana Adams: \"Brincando el Charco...\" in Power, Politics and Pentecostals in Latin America , Edward Cleary, ed., 1997. p. 164). \nAn Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as Catholic\" but provided no source for this information.  \\n\nThe CIA World Factbook reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other. Neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent.  A 2013 Pew Research survey found that only about 45% of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic, 29% as Protestant and 20% as unaffiliated with a religion. The people surveyed by Pew consisted of Puerto Ricans living in the 50 states and DC and may not be indicative of those living in the Commonwealth.  \\n\nBy 2014, a Pew Research report, with the sub-title Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region , indicated that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic, 33% were Protestant, and 8% were unaffiliated; this survey was completed between October 2013 and February 2014.   \\n\nAn Eastern Orthodox community, the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos / St. Spyridon\\'s Church is located in Trujillo Alto, and serves the small Orthodox community in the area.  In 2017, the church entered communion with the Roman Catholic Church, becoming the first Eastern Catholic Church in Puerto Rico.  This affiliation accounted for under 1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report.  There are two Eastern Orthodox Churches in the territory; the Russian Orthodox Mission Saint John Climacus in San German and the Saint George Antiochian Orthodox Church in Carolina . Both have services in English and Spanish.   There is a small Syriac Orthodox church in Aguada which is also the only Oriental Orthodox in the Island and serves a small growing community in the area. In 1940, Juanita García Peraza founded the Mita Congregation , the first religion of Puerto Rican origin.  Taíno religious practices have been rediscovered/reinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates.  Similarly, some aspects of African religious traditions have been kept by some adherents. African slaves brought and maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples; in particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santería or Ifá , and the Kongo -derived Palo Mayombe . Some aspects were absorbed into syncretic Christianity. In 1952, a handful of American Jews established the island\\'s first synagogue ; this religion accounts for under 1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report.   The synagogue, called Sha\\'are Zedeck , hired its first rabbi in 1954.  Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, numbering 3000 people,  and is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative , Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements all are represented.   In 2007, there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population.   Eight mosques are located throughout the island, with most Muslims living in Río Piedras and Caguas ; most Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent.   There is also a Bahá\\xca\\xbcí community.  In 2023, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated a temple in San Juan ,  and reported having a membership of approximately 23,000 in the commonwealth.  In 2015, the 25,832 Jehovah\\'s Witnesses represented about 0.70% of the population, with 324 congregations.  Buddhism in Puerto Rico is represented with Nichiren , Zen and Tibetan Buddhism , with the New York Padmasambhava Buddhist Center for example having a branch in San Juan.  There are several atheist activist and educational organizations, and an atheistic parody religion called the Pastafarian Church of Puerto Rico.  An ISKCON temple in Gurabo is devoted to Krishna , with two preaching centers in the San Juan metropolitan area.\\n\nThe first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gramática (Grammar School). It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed. The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language , literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.  \\n\nEducation in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels\\xe2\\x80\\x94Primary (elementary school grades 1-6), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7-12), and Higher Level (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and 94.4% for females.  According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor\\'s degree or higher.\\n\nInstruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18. As of 2010 [update] , there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.  \\n\nThe largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico (UPR) with 11 campuses. The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo , Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este . Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University , the Pontifical Catholic University , Universidad Politécnica de Puerto Rico , and the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón . Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA -approved Law Schools.\\n\nIn 2017, there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nReforma de Salud de Puerto Rico ( Puerto Rico Health Reform ) - locally referred to as La Reforma (\\'The Reform\\') - is a government-run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished , by means of contracting private health insurance companies, rather than employing government-owned hospitals and emergency centers. The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration.  \\n\nCulture\nModern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including European (predominantly Spanish, Italian , French , German and Irish ), African, and, more recently, some North American and many South Americans. Many Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades.\\n\nFrom the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English-language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On 12 March 1903, the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal Industrial\", a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years earlier.\\n\nMuch of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms. Early in the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable. The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico.   \\n\nPuerto Rico has many symbols, but only the Flor de Maga has been made official by the Government of Puerto Rico.  Other popular, traditional, or unofficial symbols of Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican spindalis , the kapok tree , the coquí frog , the jíbaro , the Taíno Indian , and Cerro Las Tetas with its jíbaro culture monument .   \\n\nThe architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions, styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule, and a century of American rule. Spanish colonial architecture , Ibero-Islamic , art deco , post-modern , and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions.\\n\nOld San Juan is one of the two barrios , in addition to Santurce , that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951, at which time the former independent municipality of Río Piedras was annexed. With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air cafés, restaurants, gracious homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism. The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San José Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista , which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León . It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico, the Colegio de Párvulos, built in 1865.\\n\nThe oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts , such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro , Fort San Cristóbal , and El Palacio de Santa Catalina , also known as La Fortaleza , acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the governor of Puerto Rico . Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site .\\n\nDuring the 1940s, sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair, and many renovation plans were suggested. There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a \"small Manhattan \". Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared as a historic building, and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas, particularly Havana , Lima and Cartagena de Indias .\\n\nPonce Creole is a unique architectural style created in Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of France, Spain and the Caribbean vernacular to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico\\'s Caribbean Sea coast.  It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian .  \\n\nPuerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background. A form of folk art , called santos evolved from the Catholic Church\\'s use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity . Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors. Santos vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special place on household altars , where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection.\\n\nAlso popular, caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals . Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented. True to their historic origins, Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs. While usually constructed of papier-m\\xc3 2ché , coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well. Red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns.\\n\nPuerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present-day status. Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government. Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write. Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition and in 1647 wrote Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico (\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\"). This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.  \\n\nSome of Puerto Rico\\'s earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero . Among these was Manuel A. Alonso , the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance. In 1849 he published El Gíbaro , a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer. Eugenio María de Hostos wrote La peregrinación de Bayoán in 1863, which used Bartolomé de las Casas as a springboard to reflect on Caribbean identity. After this first novel, Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change.\\n\nIn the late 19th century, with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters, Puerto Rican literature began to flourish. The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists. Alejandro Tapia y Rivera , also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature, ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of The Historical Library of Puerto Rico . Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer. His work The Indo-Antillano Vocabulary is valuable in understanding the way the Taínos lived. Manuel Zeno Gandía in 1894 wrote La Charca and talked about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. Antonio S. Pedreira , described in his work Insularismo the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion.\\n\nWith the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s, Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement . Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish, and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors, journalists, poets, novelists, playwrights, essayists, and screenwriters. The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the U.S. and the rest of the world. Over the past fifty years, significant writers include Ed Vega ( Omaha Bigelow ), Miguel Piñero ( Short Eyes ), Piri Thomas ( Down These Mean Streets ), Giannina Braschi ( Yo-Yo Boing! ), Rosario Ferrer (Eccentric Neighborhoods). and Esmeralda Santiago ( When I was Puerto Rican ).   \\n\nThe mass media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations , television stations and newspapers , the majority of which are conducted in Spanish . There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service . Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo Día , El Vocero and \\xc3\\x8dndice , Metro , and Primera Hora . El Vocero is distributed free of charge, as are \\xc3\\x8dndice and Metro .\\n\nNewspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include Claridad , La Perla del Sur , La Opinión , Visión , and La Estrella del Norte , among others. Several television channels provide local content in the island. These include WIPR-TV , Telemundo , Univision affiliate WLII-DT ( Teleonce ), WAPA-TV , and WKAQ-TV .\\n\nThe music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources. The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and, over the last century, from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from indigenous genres like bomba , plena , aguinaldo , danza and the popular salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton .\\n\nPuerto Rico has some national instruments, like the cuatro (Spanish for \"four\"). The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the \"Jibaro\" or people from the mountains. Originally, the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings, hence its name, but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings. It is easily confused with a guitar, even by locals. When held upright, from right to left, the strings are G, D, A, E, B.\\n\nIn the realm of classical music , the island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinfónica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, drawing in classical musicians from around the world.\\n\nWith respect to opera , the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated, that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia . In 1907, Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera - when he participated in a performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan, Italy .\\n\nPuerto Rico has been commemorated on four U.S. postal stamps. Insular Territories were commemorated in 1937, the third stamp honored Puerto Rico featuring \\' La Fortaleza \\', the Spanish Governor\\'s Palace.  The first free election for governor of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico was honored on 27 April 1949, at San Juan, Puerto Rico. \\'Inauguration\\' on the 3-cent stamp refers to the election of Luis Muñoz Marín , the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico.  San Juan, Puerto Rico was commemorated with an 8-cent stamp on its 450th anniversary issued 12 September 1971, featuring a sentry box from Castillo San Felipe del Morro .  In the \"Flags of our nation series\" 2008-2012, of the fifty-five, five territorial flags were featured. Forever stamps included the Puerto Rico Flag illustrated by a bird issued 2011.  \\n\nPuerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe (Spain), Africa and the native Taínos . Basic ingredients include grains and legumes , herbs and spices , starchy tropical tubers , vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood and shellfish, and fruits. Main dishes include mofongo , arroz con gandules , pasteles , and pig roast (or lechón ). Beverages include maví and piña colada . Desserts include flan, arroz con dulce (sweet rice pudding ), piraguas , brazo gitanos , tembleque , polvorones , and dulce de leche .\\n\nBaseball was one of the first sports to gain widespread popularity in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Baseball League serves as the only active professional league, operating as a winter league. No Major League Baseball franchise or affiliate plays in Puerto Rico; however, San Juan hosted the Montreal Expos for several series in 2003 and 2004 before they moved to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals .\\n\nThe Puerto Rico national baseball team has participated in the World Cup of Baseball winning one gold (1951), four silver and four bronze medals, the Caribbean Series (winning fourteen times) and the World Baseball Classic . In March 2006 , San Juan\\'s Hiram Bithorn Stadium hosted the opening round as well as the second round of the newly formed World Baseball Classic . Puerto Rican baseball players include Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente , Orlando Cepeda and Roberto Alomar , enshrined in 1973, 1999, and 2011 respectively.    \\n\nBoxing , basketball , and volleyball are considered popular sports as well. Wilfredo Gómez and McWilliams Arroyo have won their respective divisions at the World Amateur Boxing Championships . Other medalists include José Pedraza , who holds a silver medal, and three boxers who finished in third place, José Luis Vellón, Nelson Dieppa and McJoe Arroyo . In the professional circuit, Puerto Rico has the third-most boxing world champions and it is the global leader in champions per capita. These include Miguel Cotto , Félix Trinidad , Wilfred Benítez and Gómez among others.\\n\nThe Puerto Rico national basketball team joined the International Basketball Federation in 1957. Since then, it has won more than 30 medals in international competitions, including gold in three FIBA Americas Championships and the 1994 Goodwill Games 8 August 2004, became a landmark date for the team when it became the first team to defeat the United States in an Olympic tournament since the integration of National Basketball Association players. Winning the inaugural game with scores of 92-73 as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics organized in Athens , Greece.  Baloncesto Superior Nacional acts as the top-level professional basketball league in Puerto Rico and has experienced success since its beginning in 1930.\\n\nPuerto Rico is also a member of FIFA and CONCACAF . In 2008, the archipelago\\'s first unified league, the Puerto Rico Soccer League , was established.\\n\nOther sports include professional wrestling and road running . The World Wrestling Council and International Wrestling Association are the largest wrestling promotions in the main island. The World\\'s Best 10K , held annually in San Juan, has been ranked among the 20 most competitive races globally. The \"Puerto Rico All Stars\" team, which has won twelve world championships in unicycle basketball.  \\n\nOrganized Streetball has gathered some exposition, with teams like \"Puerto Rico Street Ball\" competing against established organizations including the Capitanes de Arecibo and AND1 \\'s Mixtape Tour Team . Six years after the first visit, AND1 returned as part of their renamed Live Tour, losing to the Puerto Rico Streetballers.  Consequently, practitioners of this style have earned participation in international teams, including Orlando \"El Gato\" Meléndez , who became the first Puerto Rican born athlete to play for the Harlem Globetrotters .  \\n\nPuerto Rico has representation in all international competitions including the Summer and Winter Olympics , the Pan American Games , the Caribbean World Series , and the Central American and Caribbean Games . Puerto Rico hosted the Pan Am Games in 1979 (officially in San Juan), and The Central American and Caribbean Games were hosted in 1993 in Ponce and in 2010 in Mayagüez .\\n\nPuerto Rican athletes have won ten medals in Olympic competition (two gold, two silver, six bronze), the first one in 1948 by boxer Juan Evangelista Venegas . Monica Puig won the first gold medal for Puerto Rico in the Olympic Games by winning the Women\\'s Tennis singles title in Rio 2016 .   \\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°12\\xe2\\x80\\xb2N 66°30\\xe2\\x80\\xb2W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.2°N 66.5°W ﻿ / 18.2; -66.5 ﻿ ( Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ) \\n"

With a total space of 600,000-square-foot (55,742 m2)  and designed by tvsdesign , it is the largest convention center in the Caribbean and one of the most technologically advanced in the Americas .  \\n\nThe Convention Center includes a 152,700-square-foot (14,190 m 2 ) Exhibition Hall that can seat up to 16,965 people and a 39,500-square-foot (3,670 m 2 ) ballroom that can accommodate up to 4,158 people.  All in all, approximately 30,000 people can be accommodated within the center simultaneously and can handle conventions of organizations as large as 10,000 participants.  The current PRCC general manager is Jorge Pérez.\\n\nThe center is operated by the Puerto Rico Convention Center District Authority , which also operates the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum , also known as the \"Choliseo\", and the Government Reception Center, known as the Antiguo Casino de Puerto Rico , in Old San Juan, as well as the 113-acre district on which the Convention Center and the attached Sheraton hotel are located.  Its current executive director is Omar Marrero.\\n\nThe convention center is named after former Governor Pedro Rosselló , who proposed and initiated the design, finance and construction of the structure.  \\n\nAfter the hit from Hurricane Maria during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , events at the Puerto Rico Convention Center were cancelled from mid-September through the end of the year while the facility was used as a warehouse and collection center by the Puerto Rican Government to provide food, water and basic necessities to those affected by the deadliest and costliest hurricane in Puerto Rican history.

        "page_content": "Contents\nPuerto Rico Iron Works\n\\n\\n\nPuerto Rico Iron Works (founded as Porto Rico Iron Works ) was a heavy industry iron foundry located in barrio La Playa in Ponce, Puerto Rico .  The company was founded in 1918.  The foundry \"was Puerto Rico\\'s most prolific steel bridge fabricator in the 20th Century\"  and the largest iron foundry in the Antilles .  At its peak, it employed over 700 people.  It closed in 1973.  \\n\nHistory\nPuerto Rico Iron Works (PRIW) was founded by Antonio Ferré Bacallao,  an 1896 immigrant from Cuba , whose father was a French engineer that had worked in the construction of the Panama Canal .  Antonio Ferré\\'s family would become one of the most legendary families in Puerto Rico: one of his sons, Luis A. Ferré , became governor of the island from 1969 to 1973, and one of his daughters, Isolina Ferré , known as The Mother Teresa of Puerto Rico , received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1999 for her outstanding role in community activities, including the founding of a small hospital and school in Playa de Ponce next to the iron foundry called Centro de Orientacion y Servicios .  \\n\nAntonio Ferré founded Puerto Rico Iron Works after experience he had garnished from his short employment experience at Puerto Rico\\'s first iron foundry, Sobrinos de Portilla Foundry , in San Juan. After learning that his uncle Luis Bacallao had settled in Ponce, Antonio Ferré moved to Ponce where his family would establish roots.  His son\\'s José, Luis, Carlos and Hermann helped transform Puerto Rico Iron Works into a highly successful business after all being educated in the United States and returning to Puerto Rico. José graduated with a  business administration degree from Boston University while Luis, Carlos and Hermann all completed engineering degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The Ferré brothers recruited some very bright talent for the company, including Raúl G. Villaronga , the company\\'s accountant who would later become the first Puerto Rican mayor of a Texas city.  \\n\nFoundry works\nThe company first started doing business for Puerto Rican sugar and coffee plantations, in the area of irrigation systems and railroad track and wagon systems to carry products between plantations in the south. It also developed machinery for the crushing of sugar cane at sugar cane mills .  Almost all of the railroad tracks laid in Puerto Rico in the early decades of the 20th century originated from PRIW. In the first half of the 20th century, the company was heavily involved in the production of iron-based bridges to address Puerto Rico\\'s need for bridges.  The foundry was located just a few blocks away from the Port of Ponce docks, making the company one within easy reach for vessels requiring repairs as well.  In the second half of the century the company was into the manufacturing of a number of specialty items such as manhole covers . In 1939, it restored the ceiling of Plaza del Mercado de Ponce .  \\n\nSocial inclination\nPuerto Rico Iron Works, under José A. Ferré\\'s leadership with brothers Luis, Carlos and Hermann, was the first company doing business in Puerto Rico to implement several labor measures that would not be adopted by the Puerto Rico Legislature until decades later, among them the institution of a Christmas bonus for employees to supplement the cost-of-living increases during financially difficult times, and the incorporation of a pension fund .  The company was also the first to provide aid to families in case of a worker's incapacity or death.  The company also implemented a minimum wage \"law\" of its own and an 8-hour labor day \"before US law enforced those ideas\".  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n17°58\\xe2\\x80\\xb255.92\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°37\\xe2\\x80\\xb212.29\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 17.9822000°N 66.6200806°W ﻿ / 17.9822000; -66.6200806 \\n"

The barrio is also the home of the Humacao Nature Reserve and the Punta Santiago Beach and Vacation Area.  Punta Santiago is one of the most vulnerable barrios to flooding and complete destruction whenever hurricanes enter Puerto Rico through the area of Humacao.\\n\nHistory\nThe fishing village of Punta Santiago was originally called Playa de Humacao as it was the closest beach to Humacao Pueblo , the historic and administrative downtown area of Humacao.  The community of Punta Santiago used to be part of two former barrios of Humacao, one called Humacao Playa and the other called Mabú. By the end of the 19th century barrio Mabú had been eliminated and incorporated into barrio Playa, now renamed Punta Santiago after the geographical headland or point ( punta ) where the fishing village is located.  \\n\nSince December 1938, Cayo Santiago , located immediately off Punta Santiago, has been the home to a population of free roaming Rhesus macaques imported from India by the School of Tropical Medicine in San Juan , the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and the University of Puerto Rico .\\n\nThe area where the Humacao nature reserve is located today saw a number of bunkers and defensive infrastructure built during the Second World War , including a lookout post at the top of El Morrillo hill.  This area which contains a number of mangrove and Pterocarpus forests was later proclaimed a wildlife refuge in 1986.  \\n\nHurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. The hurricane eye entered the island close to Punta Yeguas in Yabucoa , not far from Punta Santiago. The barrio was particularly vulnerable to the associated storm surges . According to Father José Colón, the local Catholic priest, the hurricane caused the total flooding of Punta Santiago.  \\n\n\"The town was flooded from all directions, from the ocean, rain and nearby rivers...\"\\n\nPunta Santiago was one of the most impacted communities in the aftermath of the hurricane. It was the location of the viral image of an SOS message written on one of the roads of the community.  The Punta Santiago Vacation Center was greatly affected by the hurricane, and it remained abandoned by 2023. \nFlood zone\nIn 2019, updated flood zone maps show that because of its location- where most cyclones enter the island, Humacao is one of the most vulnerable areas of Puerto Rico.  Humacao was working on flood mitigation plans and shared that its barrios located on the coast; Antón Ruíz , Punta Santiago, Río Abajo , Buena Vista and Candelero Abajo barrios, are prone to flooding and in danger of being completed destroyed by a hurricane.  \\n\nDemographics\nPunta Santiago was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the combined population of Punta Santiago and San Francisco barrios was 1,754.  \\n \\n\nThe population of Punta Santiago in 2020 was 3,716, a 21.3% decrease from 4,723 in 2010.  \\n\nLandmarks and places of interest\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The light was a third-order lighthouse that served as the primary light connecting the island\\'s southern and eastern lights system. The design was drawn and laid out by Joaquin Gisbert in 1890. The lighthouse construction was initially overseen by Adrian Duffaut. It was built from March 13, 1891, to September 29, 1893. Final construction was taken over by the Spanish Body of Engineers according to annotations of the historian Carlos Moral. It was originally named Faro de Mala Pascua after the cape to the west. Later, it was moved and renamed after the Point of the construction site so the light could perform a double duty warning ships off the Sargent reef.

These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nLocated across the central plaza in Quebradillas barrio-pueblo is the Parroquia San Rafael Arcángel , a Roman Catholic church which was inaugurated in 1950. The first church at the site was a wooden construction completed in 1823. The second church made of mampostería (rubblework) was built in 1828, however, it was badly damaged by the 1918 San Fermín earthquake and was demolished soon thereafter.  \\n\nHistory\nQuebradillas barrio-pueblo was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Quebradillas barrio was 1,166.  \\n \\n\nSectors\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.      \\n\nThe following sectors are in Quebradillas barrio-pueblo:  \\n\nResidencial Jardines del Carmen , and Urbanización La Ceiba .\\n\nSee also\nReferences"

        "page_content": "Contents\nRafael Hernández Marín\nRafael Hernández Marín (October 24, 1892 - December 11, 1965) was a Puerto Rican songwriter and the author of hundreds of popular songs in the Latin American repertoire.  He specialized in Cuban styles, such as the canción , bolero and guaracha . Among his most famous compositions are \" Lamento Borincano ,\" \"Capullito de alhelí,\" \"Campanitas de cristal,\" \"Cachita,\" \" Silencio ,\" \"El cumbanchero,\" \"Ausencia,\" and \"Perfume de gardenias.\"\\n\nCareer\nRafael Hernández Marín was born in the town of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico , into a poor family, on October 24, 1892. His parents were María Hernández Marín and Miguel Angel Rosa, though he was given only his mother\\'s surname.   As a child, he learned the craft of cigar making, from which he made a modest living. He also grew to love music and asked his parents to permit him to become a full-time music student. When he was 12 years old, Hernández studied music in San Juan , under the guidance of music professors Jose Ruellan Lequenica and Jesús Figueroa. He learned to play many musical instruments, including the clarinet , tuba , violin , piano , and guitar .  At 14, he played for the Cocolia Orquestra. Hernández moved to San Juan where he played for the municipal orchestra under the director Manuel Tizol . In 1913, Hernández begot his first child, Antonio Hernández (out of wedlock), to Ana Bone.\\n\nIn 1917, Hernández was working as a musician in North Carolina , when the United States entered World War I. The jazz bandleader, James Reese Europe , recruited brothers Rafael and Jesús Hernández, along with 16 more Puerto Ricans, to join the United States Army \\'s Harlem Hell fighters musical band, the Orchestra Europe. He enlisted and was assigned to the U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment (formerly known as the 15th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard, created in New York City June 2, 1913). The regiment, nicknamed \"The Harlem Hell Fighters,\" by the Germans, served in France. Hernández toured Europe with the Orchestra Europe. The 369th was awarded the French Croix de Guerre for battlefield gallantry by the President of France.  \\n\nAfter World War I ended, he returned to the United States in 1919. Hernández began a long and intense period of artistic composition and performance. He was part of the Lucky Roberts Band, with which he made his first musical tour of the United States. Later, he moved to Cuba, where he directed the Fausto Theater orchestra in Havana.  Later on, Hernández moved to New York City. In 1925,  he started writing songs and organized a trio called \" Trio Borincano .\" In 1926, fellow Puerto Rican Pedro Flores , who was a composer, joined the Trio. Even though Hernández and Flores became and always remained good friends, they soon went their separate ways and artistically competed against each other. After the trio broke up, he formed a quartet called \"Cuarteto Victoria,\" which included singer Myrta Silva , also known as La Guarachera and La Gorda de Oro . With both groups, Hernández traveled and played his music all over the United States and Latin America.  On September 2, 1927, Hernández\\'s sister, Victoria , opened Casa Hernandez , a music store which also acted as a booking agency and base of operations for her brother.  In 1929, Trío Borinquen recorded Linda Quisqueya (originally titled Linda Borinquen ) and that same year, he founded the \"Cuarteto Victoria\" (also known as \"El Cuarteto Rico\") named after his sister.  \\n\nIn 1932, Hernández moved to Mexico. There, he directed an orchestra and enrolled in Mexico\\'s National Music Conservatory, to further enrich his musical knowledge. Hernández also became an actor and organized musical scores in Mexico\\'s \"golden age\" of movies. His wife (and eventual widow) is Mexican.  \\n\nIn 1937, Hernández wrote \" Lamento Borincano .\" That same year, he also wrote \" Preciosa .\" In 1947, Hernández returned to Puerto Rico and became the director of the orchestra at the government-owned WIPR Radio.  \\n\nHernandez also composed Christmas music , Danzas, Zarzuelas, Guarachas, Lullabies, Boleros, Waltzes , and more.  \\n\nHernández\\'s works include \"Ahora seremos felices\" (Now, We Will Be Happy), \"Campanitas de cristal\" (Crystal Bells), \"Capullito de Alhelí,\" \"Culpable\" (Guilty), \"El Cumbanchero\"  (also known as \"Rockfort Rock\" or \"Comanchero\" (sic) to reggae aficionados), \"Ese soy yo\" (That\\'s Me), \"Perfume de Gardenias\" (Gardenia\\'s Perfume), \" Silencio \" (Silence), and \"Tú no comprendes\" (You Don\\'t Understand), among 3,000 others. Many of his compositions were strongly based on Cuban musical idioms, such as the guaracha\\'s \" Cachita \" and \"Buchipluma na\\' ma,\"  which were often mistaken as songs by Cuban authors.  His music became an important part of Puerto Rican culture.  \\n\nHernández was Honorary President of the Authors and Composers Association. He was also the founder of little league baseball in Puerto Rico. President John F. Kennedy christened him \"Mr. Cumbanchero\".  \\n\nHernández died in San Juan on December 11, 1965, shortly after Banco Popular de Puerto Rico produced a TV special in his honor in which he addressed the people for the last time. The special was simulcast on all TV and most island radio stations. The TV special was rebroadcast on May 13, 2007. Rafael Hernández\\'s remains are buried in the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery of Old San Juan .\\n\nLegacy\nPuerto Rico has honored his memory by naming public buildings, avenues, and schools after him. The airport in Aguadilla is named Rafael Hernández Airport . There are schools in New York City , Boston , and in Newark, New Jersey named after Rafael Hernández. Renowned Puerto Rican sculptor Tomás Batista created a statue of Hernández, which is in the municipality of Bayamón, Puerto Rico . The Interamerican University of Puerto Rico , the repository of his works, operates a small museum in his honor at its Metropolitan Campus in San Juan, which is directed by his son, Alejandro (Chalí) Hernández. The Hernandez Houses housing complex in New York City is named after Rafael Hernández.\\n\nAt the behest former senator Lucy Arce , the Senate of Puerto Rico , under the first term of Thomas Rivera Schatz built the Rafael Hernández Plaza with a bigger-than-lifesize statue of the composer, and a statue of a Puerto Rican jíbaro riding a horse honoring his Lamento Borincano .  The park is located at the easternmost tip of San Juan\\'s Paseo de la Covadonga .\\n\n\\nPuerto Rican singer Marc Anthony recorded Hernández\\'s \"Preciosa\" and sang the song in a 2005 concert in New York City\\'s Madison Square Garden . According to an article in the New York Times :\n\"Mr. Anthony did his version of Preciosa . It may have been the night\\'s most popular love song, precisely because it\\'s not about a woman: it\\'s about a whole island, instead.\" \nIn 1969, Puerto Rican actor Orlando Rodriguez played Hernandez in the bio-pic El Jibarito Rafael , which was directed by the Mexican actor Julián Soler .  \\n\nIn 1999, Hernández was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame .  \\n\nOn March 23, 2001, Casa Hernandez, the music store which served as Hernandez\\'s booking agency and base of operations, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, reference #01000244, as \"Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernandez\".  \\n\nIn 2017, Rafael Hernández was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.  \\n\nMilitary decorations and awards\nAmong Hernández\\'s military decorations are the following:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nRamón Rivero\nPage version status\nThis is an accepted version of this page\n\\n\nRamón Rivero (May 29, 1909 - August 24, 1956) — known as Diplo — was a Puerto Rican comedian , actor , and composer .    Rivero made his television debut in Puerto Rico in \"La Taberna India\" (The India Tavern), the first comedy/variety show on Puerto Rican TV. He starred in the movies, Los Peloteros (\"The Baseball Players\"), and Una Gallega en La Habana (\"A Gallega in Havana\"). Rivero also organized the world\\'s first known Walk-A-Thon, to raise money for the Liga Puertorriqueña Contra el Cáncer (the Puerto Rican League Against Cancer).  \\n\nEarly years\nRivero (birth name: Arturo Ramón Máximo Ortiz del Rivero [ note 1 ] ) was born in the town of Naguabo, Puerto Rico , to José Ortiz Alibrán and Providencia del Rivero. In 1917, his family moved to the Old San Juan section of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico. There he received his primary and secondary education. As a young man he learned to play various musical instruments, among them the piano, the guitar and the mandolin, under the tutelage of Amelia Maestú y Jorge Rubiano. His father, a lawyer, sent him to Ontario, Canada to study law, however while he was in Canada, he learned to play baseball and received an offer to try out for the New York Giants major league team. He did not accept the offer and when he returned to Puerto Rico he joined the \"Senadores de San Juan\" (San Juan Senators) baseball club. Rivero married and found it difficult to sustain his family economically as a professional baseball player, therefore he moved with his family to the town of Cayey and worked as a physical education instructor at a local school.    \\n\nCareer as an entertainer\nIn Cayey, he met and befriended Jose Luis Torregrosa, and joined Torregrosa\\'s traveling theatrical company. Torregrosa became his best friend and later served as his comedy sidekick. Together they acted in the comedy \"El proceso de Armando Líos\"; this experience convinced Rivero to pursue a career in comedy. After witnessing a comedy by Cuban comedian Leopoldo Fernández also known as \"Tres Patines\", Rivero adopted the idea of creating a comical \"Afro-Puerto Rican\" character.  His inspiration for the character was someone he met during his youth years in San Juan called \"Diplomacia\", hence he named his character \"Diplo\".   Together with Torregrosa, Rivero founded \"La Farándula Bohemia\", a theatrical company in which he was able to develop the character \"Diplo\" and make him known to the public. Rivero\\'s father asked him to change his name because another son was a priest, and having a comedian in the family ran against propriety. Rivero respected his father\\'s request and changed his name from Arturo Ramón Máximo Ortiz del Rivero to Ramón Rivero, and he added the nickname \"Diplo\". Among the local talents that Rivero and Torregrosa discovered was Juan Boria , a Puerto Rican poet who would become known for his Afro-Caribbean poetry. In 1941, Boria was participating in a show in the town of Loíza . Rivero and Torregrosa, who were present, were so impressed with Boria\\'s performance that they incorporated him into their troupe .   \\n\nRivero\\'s comedy act became well known, not only on the traveling theatrical scene, but also in the local radio shows such as \"Los embajadores del buen humor\" (Ambassadors of Good Humor), \"La vida en broma\" (Life as a Joke) and \"El Tremendo Hotel\" (The tremendous hotel), where he also actively participated as a script writer. During World War II , Rivero and his acting troupe, the \"La Farándula Bohemia\" (Bohemian Show-business), traveled to the United States military bases in which Puerto Rican troops were stationed and not only did he entertain the men, but he also accepted and delivered mail to the families of those whom he met overseas.  Puerto Rican industrialist Angel Ramos , owner of WKAQ Radio, signed an exclusive deal with Rivero to broadcast \"El Tremendo Hotel\" via the airwaves. His show became the most popular radio show in Puerto Rico. \"El Tremendo Hotel\", together with his other production La Farándula Corona , catapulted WKAQ to the top of the ratings.  Among the many Puerto Rican artists who began their careers in \"El Tremendo Hotel\" were Luis Vigoreaux , Miguel \\xc3\\x81ngel \\xc3\\x81lvarez  and Sylvia Rexach .  On one occasion, Rivero denounced and lambasted a foreign newspaperwoman who had published an article in the U.S. stating that \"Puerto Rican men sold their women to the American servicemen\", exhorting his countrymen to expel her from Puerto Rico (which they did), during a radio broadcast of El Tremendo Hotel .     \\n\nRivero produced and acted in various theatrical productions in Puerto Rico among them Mosquilandia (Mosquito Land), El Príncipe Wele-Wele (Prince Wele-Wele), A Mi Me Matan Pero Yo Gozo (They can kill me, but I\\'ll enjoy it), Ese Niño Es Mio (The child is mine), Hay Que Defenderse (One must defend himself), La Familia del Lío (The family of problems) and El Tremendo Hotel , however his success was not limited to the theater and radio.   \\n\nIn 1946, El Mundo , a local newspaper, began a comic strip about Rivero\\'s character Diplo, making this the first time that a Puerto Rican from the local entertainment industry received such a distinction.  Rivero was a pioneer of Puerto Rican television who produced the first comedy show La Taberna India (The India Saloon) for Angel Ramos\\'s Telemundo , a local television station.  He became known to his fans as the \"Rey de la Farándula\" (King of Show-business) and \"Señor Televisión\" (Mr. Television). In winter 1953, Rivero and his troupe traveled to New York City to perform before the Puerto Rican community which had migrated and settled there during the Great Puerto Rican migration of the 1940s . For three weeks Rivero and his show \"El Tremendo Hotel\" held sold-out performances at the Teatro San Juan, Teatro Hispano and the Teatro Puerto Rico .   \\n\nActor and composer\nIn Cuba , Rivero participated in the movie Una Gallega en la Habana with Niní Marshall , however it was in Puerto Rico that in 1953, he played the lead role of \"Pepe\" in what is possibly the best motion picture ever made in the island, Los Peloteros (\"The Baseball Players\") (with Puerto Rican actress Míriam Colón co-starring as his wife, Lolita) under the direction of Jack Delano.  The movie, which is based on a real-life story, is about a man (Pepe) who, despite the fact that no one takes him seriously, is willing to coach a group of very poor children and help them raise funds for their baseball team.   \\n\nRivero wrote more than 3000 scripts for radio, theater, television and motion pictures and was the author of \\xc2\\xbfPor qué se ríe la gente? (What Makes People Laugh), and El Album de la Radio , (1940-1948), a significant study and the first historical record of the radio industry in Puerto Rico. Rivero also composed more than ten songs, among them \"\\xc2\\xbfPor qué será?\" (Why is it?), \"Ya me olvidaste\" (You already forgot me), \"Comienza el fin\" (The beginning of the end), \"Así es\" (That\\'s how it is), \"Me gustó\" (I liked it), \"Hola, don Pepito\" (Hello, Mister Pepito) and \"Donde quiera que tú vayas\" (Wherever you go).   \\n\nActivist\nIn 1953, Rivero organized the world\\'s first known Walk-A-Thon . He walked 80 miles from the capital city of San Juan , crossing Puerto Rico up and down the treacherous mountain roads of Cayey , known as \"La Piquiña\", to Ponce , on the other side of the island, to raise money for the Liga Puertorriqueña Contra el Cáncer (the Puerto Rican League Against Cancer). In that walkathon, Rivero raised the equivalent of $85,000 in 4 days. The Walk-A-Thon turned into a historical event that became part of the collective consciousness of Puerto Ricans all over the world, and has been copied several times since.  Rivero also defended the victims of injustice during student revolts at the University of Puerto Rico , led the first actors\\' strike on the island, and was the first producer/personality to actively combat racial prejudice on Puerto Rican television, incorporating blacks in his television shows; first in \"La Taberna India\" (Juan Boria), followed by Rita Delgado and Dixon as cast members of his \"La Farándula Corona\".   \\n\nLegacy\nIn 1955, Rivero\\'s doctors recommended that he lessen his work activities for the good of his health. Cervecería India , Inc., Puerto Rico\\'s largest beer brewery and the sponsor of \"La Taberna India\", did not agree with his doctors request and required that Rivero continue producing 3 weekly television shows for them, resulting in Rivero\\'s refusal and resignation. He then approached Cervecería Corona (Cervecería India\\'s competitor) with the idea of producing a weekly television comedy show. Cervecería Corona agreed to sponsor the show which he named \"La Farándula Corona\".  Rivero\\'s new show became very popular among the Puerto Rican audiences.  \\n\nRivero was in the process of organizing his performing troupe, which was to travel to the town of Yabucoa in an attempt to help the town after it was devastated by the Santa Clara hurricane , when on August 24, 1956, he suddenly died of a congenital aneurysm. Rivero was the father of five children, three from his first two marriages and two which he had in his third marriage with Puerto Rican actress Alicia Bibiloni.  Rivero was buried at Cementerio Santa María Magdalena de Pazzi, San Juan, Puerto Rico , and a state of national mourning for two weeks was declared on the island.  It was estimated by \"El Imparcial\", a local newspaper, that a total of 50,000 of his countrymen attended his burial.  Due to his untimely sudden death, Rivero was unable to participate in an anticipated film with Hollywood actress Rita Hayworth .   \\n\nThe memory of Rivero has been honored by both by the Government of Puerto Rico, who declared a national Ramon Rivero \"Diplo\" day in 2009, and by Naguabo his hometown who named an urbanization after him. In 1965, a 15-foot bronze statue/monument to Ramon Rivero \"Diplo\" was unveiled in the town square. Puerto Rican poet Juan Antonio Corretjer wrote \"Morir y Reír (A Ramón Rivero)\" (Laugh and Die (To Ramón Rivero)) a poem dedicated to Rivero and his character \"Diplo\". On June 16, 2006, the Government of Puerto Rico approved \"Ley Num. 115\" (Law Number 115) which declares every May 29 the \"Day of Ramón Ortiz del Rivero (Diplo)\"  In 2009, a \"Diplo Returns to San Juan\" walkathon, in memory of the first event, raised almost $200,000. In 2009, in the commemoration of his 100th birthday, the Fundación Ramón Rivero released the book, \"Diplo! \\xc2\\xbfPor qué se reía la gente?\"; Authored by José Orbi; ISBN 978-0-9661619-2-2 .    \\n\nAwards/Special recognition\nTV creator/producer\nTheater\nFilms\nRadio\nMusic/Composer\nAmong the songs composed by Rivero are the following  \\n\nBooks\nNotes\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The house now hosts several cultural and religious institutions including the Shaare Zedeck Synagogue and the Jewish Community Center of Puerto Rico ,  and a photojournalism museum.\\n\nDesign and architecture\nThe design for Casa Aboy was the product of various architects, among them Antonin Nechodoma , a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright . Nechodoma, who moved to Puerto Rico around 1905, used a tropical style of architecture which became popular in the island. Puerto Rican architect Miguel Ferrer and engineer Francisco Pons also worked on the property\\'s design with the purpose of taking advantage of the north breezes and natural light of the location. Pons and Ferrer hired Frank B. Hatch, who had worked with Nechodoma, also put some of his ideas in the design of the house. Finally, Ramón Aboy Lompré made his own suggestions for the house, which he would inhabit.\\n\nThe house entrance features an ample house-wide porch with two posts, typical of Nechodoma\\'s style. The attic windows were altered to adorn the front of the house, and the tinted glass were bought on the Dominican Republic . Aside of the porch, it also features ornamental tiles, a double interior staircase, and the style of the roof are all Nechodoma\\'s trademarks. However, unlike his style, the house features big rooms, and a wide hallway.  \\n\nHistory\nAfter its construction, the Aboy Residence was a common setting for social gatherings. The building on the original lot, which extended from the avenue in front to what is now Martí Street, no longer exists. Upon the death of the original owner, the lot was divided between his two sons who built twin residences there. However, in 1986, after a legal battle over the inheritance, the house was closed. Shortly after, Ramón Aboy died.\\n\nToday only the house built by Don Ramón Aboy remains. It has been declared part of Puerto Rico\\'s \"cultural heritage,\" and it houses the Federación de Foto Periodistas de Puerto Rico (Federation of Photojournalists of Puerto Rico). The Federation helped fund Ramón Aboy Miranda , a direct descendant of the original owner.\\n\nIn 1989, the Aboy Residence was listed at the National Register of Historic Sites . The local government began the process of restoring it with the help of the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture , and Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly , among others. The house was reopened on May 5, 1994, for the purpose of free cultural activities. It also housed the Cultural Center Ramón Aboy Miranda, which is part of the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture.\\n\nThe street that runs past the residence also carries the name of the Aboy family because it was constructed on the lands that belonged to them. Distinguished members of this family have included the aforementioned Ramón Aboy Miranda (accomplished Puerto Rican photojournalist); José Ferrer (actor and first Puerto Rican to win an Academy Award ), and Carmen Aboy de Valldejuli (Puerto Rican cooking pioneer and author, with her husband Luis Valldejuli Duprey, of various Puerto Rican cookbooks).\\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nResidencia Armstrong-Poventud\n\\n\nResidencia Armstrong-Poventud (Armstrong-Poventud Residence) is a historic building located in the Ponce Historic Zone in Ponce, Puerto Rico , across from the Catedral Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe .  The construction of this home set the stage for the construction of other homes of similar architectural elements, character and opulence in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Ponce.  : 3 The architectural style is collectively known as Ponce Creole . The home was designed and built by Manuel Víctor Domenech for the Armstrong-Poventud family.  It is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as the Armstrong-Toro House , and is also known as the Casa de las Cariatides . In 1991, the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña turned the house into a museum, which it manages.   \\n\nConstruction date\nThe Institute of Puerto Rican Culture ( ICP ) and the Puerto Rico Office of Historical Preservation have determined that the house was built in 1899. The American Architect and Building News magazine, on the front cover of its 25 January 1899, issue published the design of the Residencia Armstrong-Poventud.  The Residencia was inaugurated fully as a museum by the ICP in October 2008. Prior to 2008, and starting in 1991, visitors were allowed to tour the house while it concurrently served as the Southern headquarters of the institute.  The institute operates a small but diverse store in a wing of the museum.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe Carlos Armstrong-Toro Residence is one of Ponce\\'s most famous houses. This structure was designed and built by Manuel Domenech, one of the island\\'s most distinguished architects of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of Domenech\\'s designs include: the Asilo De Pobres de Mayaguez and the Residencia Batiz . Domenech, a public figure in Puerto Rico during the 20th century, built many noteworthy private residences and public buildings in San Juan , Ponce, and Mayaguez .  : 3 \\n\nMr. Armstrong-Toro was one of Ponce\\'s most distinguished citizens as well. His father, Pedro Lothario Armstrong y Creagh, [ citation needed ] was a Ponce merchant from St. Croix in the Danish West Indies . At the time a great deal of Puerto Rico\\'s imports came through Danish St. Thomas . Armstrong-Toro was one of the first bankers in Puerto Rico, founder of the Banco de Ponce and the Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño . Mr. Armstrong-Toro developed an international banking network with offices in Puerto Rico, Cuba , the United States , and Denmark . As a result of his extensive financial relations with the Danish government, Mr. Armstrong was conferred the high honor of the \" Order of the Dannebrog \" of Denmark and was named Danish Consul to Puerto Rico.  : 3 \\n\nArchitecturally speaking, the Armstrong-Toro Residence is significant in the history of Ponce because it is one of Domenech\\'s most distinguished eclectic designs and probably the best known. Its unique caryatid-framed main entrance, its intricate ornamental details and its location upon the most prominent lot in the city of Ponce (across from the Cathedral and public plaza ) have made this house a true architectural landmark in the city\\'s traditional urban core. As a result, many houses were built during the early 20th century with similar elements in a similar vocabulary, contributing to the unique historic district of Ponce .  : 3 \\n\nPhysical appearance\nResidencia Armstrong-Poventud is a two-story masonry building on the westside of Calle Union (No. 9), directly in front of the Cathedral and Plaza of the historic urban center of Ponce. The almost-cubic proportions of the facade are articulated in three bays: 2 wider bays flanking a central, narrower entrance bay.  : 2 \\n\nAt the ground level, a pink-stone plinth serves as a podium for the one story eclectic pilasters at the north and south extremes of the facade and for the two caryatids , which flank the main entrance and define the three bays of the facade. The central entrance arch cuts the podium and houses intricately carved hardwood doors and a stained-glass fanlight protected by decorative wrought iron railings. Bays 1 and 3 both consist of paired arches, located above the podium and articulated in an ionic pilaster order. Each arch-window houses folding jalousie shutters.  : 3 \\n\nAt the upper level there are four Ionic pilasters with pedestals resting on a continuous horizontal string-course. The three openings are symmetrically arranged and equally proportioned and articulated: a simple surround with a keystone frames a wide arch, opening out to a balcony through wooden jalousie doors. Decoratively etched clear glass lights occupy the tympanum over each opening. The first and third bay balconies contain waist-high decorative cast-iron railings and the wider central balcony consists of stone balusters and rails supported by the caryatid figures of the ground floor. A full-entablature cornice and solid parapet cap the facade composition. Roman-style amphorae on the parapet, above each pilaster, serve as finials for each bay division.  : 3  \\n\nAt the northern end of the structure, a concrete port-cochere enclosed by decorative wrought-iron railings projects from the upper-level floor line, creating a side terrace for the upper floor.  : 2 \\n\nThe house is very simple in plan and elegant in execution. The main entrance accesses a foyer with steps leading up to the major circulation hall through wooden and stained-glass double-doors. A sweeping stairway, toward the back of the house on the left side of the hall accesses the second floor, which is similar in plan to the first. All floors within the house are parquet and ceilings are of hand-painted decorative pressed metal. The floors were installed during the last restoration and the pressed-metal ceilings are all original.  : 2 \\n\nAs a result of the disastrous earthquake of 1918 , the structure\\'s northern wall had fallen and was subsequently reconstructed according to the original plans. The concrete-vaulted port-cochere was added at that time. Aside from this latter addition, the Armstrong-Toro house maintains the exact architecture of the original design.  : 2 \\n\nAcquisition and restoration\nThe Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (ICP) acquired the building from the descendants of the original owners.  Some of the original furniture and personal items of the home were included in the acquisition, as the Armstrong family lived the house uninterrupted for eight decades.  The ICP restored the building on two occasions: in the 1980s and then again from 2006 to 2008.  \\n\nDescription\nAlmost all the furniture and utensils from that era are still in place, as well as paintings and pictures belonging the original owners of this grand old home located directly in front of Our Lady of Guadalupe Cathedral , in the town square. The house is easy to spot thanks to the two caryatids in the front of the house and its overall neoclassic architectural style.  With its gorgeous, neoclassical facade, the Casa Armstrong-Poventud is among the most stately and elegant houses in Ponce.  Built in 1900 as the home for this Scottish banker, the house served as the regional office of the ICP for 15 years.  Casa Armstrong-Poventud building is a magnificent example of the neoclassical architectural heritage of the island.  The Residence was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 29 October 1987.\\n\nHistorical background\nThe Casa Armstrong-Poventud Museum is an example of the main Belle-\\xc3\\x89poque (English: \"The Beautiful Epoch\"), a French term that is used to describe a long period in European history noted for peace, political stability, and industrial progress. Started around the middle of the 19th century and ran up to World War I . This period of great prosperity coincided with England\\'s Queen Victoria\\'s kingdom (1837-1901) during which industrial and artistic greatness were promoted with such a success that it also came to be known as the Victorian Era .  \\n\nUnlike previous eras, the level of artistic and industrial prosperity reached during the Belle \\xc3\\x89poque was such that it reached the masses, in Europe as well as in the Americas .  Important exhibitions marked this progress.  There was one in England in 1851, and various others followed in various other major cities. There was for example another one in Paris in 1855 that brought about an even larger number of attendees, unprecedented in the history of mankind: 5,100,000 people coming from virtually every existing country.  In 1878, Paris celebrated another Fair yet where the telephone and the light bulb were shown for the first time. The city was first lit during this 1878 Paris Fair.  \\n\nPonce had its own fair in 1882. It was dedicated to agriculture, commerce, industry and the arts. Just like Paris four years earlier, Ponce was also illuminated on the first day of the Ponce Fair: Plaza Las Delicias , the Unión Mercantil building, the Ponce Casino and some of the most majestic homes in the Majestic City, such as the Armstrong Residence.  \\n\nThe economic affluence in Ponce during the second half of the 19th century was due to great wealth from sugarcane plantations . This made possible the construction of various public works such as the Teatro La Perla , the Ponce aqueduct, and several majestic homes, like Armstrong Puventud Home.  The home of Señor Carlos W. Armstrong Toro and lady Eulalia Pou, now known as the Armstrong-Poventud Residence, represents this wealth despite the restrictive colonial Spanish government of the Island at the time.  \\n\nSeñor Carlos Walter Armstrong Toro established his wealth on the agricultural prosperity the Island experienced: first as businessman, later as a banker, and finally as a politician. Mr. Carlos Armstrong Toro had an import/export business that exposed him to the great cities of the world and put him in touch with the architectural styles of the day.  He was, for example, a partner in a New York City business. In addition, he was also the Danish consul in Ponce. It was with this background that he ordered th construction of his home in Ponce.  Señor Armstrong Toro married lady Eulalia Pou Carreras, on 11 January 1868. Doña Eulalia Pou was herself from a wealthy Ponce family.  \\n\nArchitecture of the residence\nThe Museum at Casa Armstrong Poventud presents the latest architectural and artistic taste in vogue at the end of the 19th century in Europe. For example, heavy use of glass on doors and windows. The glass decor used in the front door of the residence, for instance, is almost identical to those used in the Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations in England years earlier. The floral and natural motifs in the residence, are also characteristic of those comprising the new artistic expression of the Victorian Era evident in Europe and the United States in the first decades of the 20th century.  \\n\nThe front door is an excellent example of doors characteristic of the Victorian era. It achieved two purposes: decorative but also to allow the passage of natural daylight. Almost all the doors in this Museum have unique majestic-style characteristics not found in doors in the capital city of San Juan , where doors are considerably simpler.  The residence displays a harmonious appreciation for the style, as much by the architects as by the owners, of the Belle \\xc3\\x89poque.  \\n\nThe \"cariátides\" ( caryatids ) statues used by architect Manuel V. Domenech for the front of the house were not the classical ones, but modernized adaptations of the classical ones. They do not display the solemn expression of the traditional ones, but smiling young people with a modern hairdo and displaying body motion.  Even the pedestal on which the status lay has an Art-Nouveau style.  \\n\nThe interior furniture and other items are also Victorian.  The Residence emphasizes a multiplicity of styles in its interior, not just different epochs, but also different countries: Chinese jar, Victorian lamps, Art-Nouveau , and Austrian glass chandeliers.  \\n\nMr. Manuel Victor Domenech used a variety of architectural elements from various epochs in a unique creative manner. He used, for example the most advanced objects of residential utility of the time such as electricity, bathroom and kitchens that functioned with an automatic plumbing system, to create a structure characteristics of the end of the Victorian era, known as Modernism .  There is heavy use of electric light bulb lamps at a time when over 90% of the population of Puerto Rico used no electricity or plumbing.  \\n\nOverall\nThe overall impression of the residence is one displaying a new appearance of modernism. It has both Victorian and modernistic elements in it, approaching details seen in Belgium , New York City, Chicago, and London at the time. The resulting style is one of modernistic Victorian architecture.  \\n\nEffects of the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquake\nThe building sustained damage due to the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquake . There are plans to restore the house from the damages it sustained.  \\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nRosaly-Batiz House\nThe Rosaly-Batiz House  is a historic building located on Villa street in Barrio Primero in Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the city\\'s historic district . The building dates from 1897.  It was designed by Manuel V. Domenech , a Puerto Rican architect that was responsible for designing various other now-historic buildings. Domenech built this residence for Ponce mayor Pedro Juan Rosaly . Domenech himself became mayor of Ponce and held numerous other political positions in Puerto Rico . The Batiz Residence is a monument to a great man and his works and a vivid reminder of the aristocracy of the years prior to the Great Depression .  \\n\nHistory and significance\nThe Batiz Residence was built in 1897 by the renown engineer Manuel Domenech for the Mayor of the City of Ponce, Don Pedro Juan Rosaly. A native of Ponce, Domenech graduated from the prestigious Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of New York and was responsible for many of the island\\'s most lavish turn-of-the-century buildings.  \\n\nAmong Domenech\\'s other designs are the Caryatid House (1910) which faces the Ponce Cathedral and the \" Asilo de Pobres \" (listed in the National Register on 2 December 1985). Domenech was also Mayor of the City of Ponce and held many governmental positions in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nAlthough a particular style cannot be attributed to Domenech, the vocabulary of his designs ranged from the purest Neoclassical to the most intricate eccletic. In this case, Domenech referred to the Renaissance Italian Palazzo as a model, a theme repeated in other properties both in Ponce and Mayaguez . However stern, the Batiz Residence displays a greater degree of mannerism over eclecticism, resulting in one of Ponce\\'s most distinguished structures.  \\n\nSale of the residence\nThe property was purchased in the 1920s as the city residence of Antonio Batiz Olivera, a wealthy coffee plantation owner. During his visits to Ponce the house was said to be filled with light and music. Great balls, concerts and intellectual gatherings characterized the Batiz family and, thus, the house.  \\n\nThe structure has never been altered from what Domenech designed. Only minor maintenance work has been carried out during its many years of forgotten splendor.  \\n\nThe Batiz Residence today is a monument to the great man that Domenech was and his works, and a vivid reminder of the aristocracy of the years prior to the Great Depression.  \\n\nPhysical appearance and description\nThe Batiz Residence is located on the southeast corner of Villa Street at Mendez Vigo Street. It occupies a plot of land 1145 meters square, bordered by Villa Street on the north and Luna Street on the south.  \\n\nThis structure of stuccoed brick and rubble consists of two stories set on a podium approximately four feet above street level. The property follows a U-shaped plan, creating a rectangular courtyard enclosed at the rear by a garden wall. The roof is flat, of wood and brick construction.  \\n\nThe main facade is divided into five bays in an A-B-A rhythm established by a single-bay central section and flanking two-bay sections. Rustic quoins turn the east and west corners of the facade. An italianate cornice spans the roof-line between the rusticated quoins.  \\n\nAt the first level, a recessed loggia is created by an arcade of segmental arches supported by diminished Doric columns on pedestals . Balusters enclose the arcade . The central bay is separated from the rest by a one-storey pair of rusticated pilasters . This bay breaks the podium for access to the main entrance and incorporates a round arch beginning at a point lower than the other arches. Inside the loggia the central doorway is flanked by rusticated segmental arches with full-height, double-shutter jalousies.  \\n\nA continuous string course separates the first floor from the second. At the upper level there are five rusticated openings similar to those of the first storey. The three inner bays open to a continuous balcony with wrought iron railing in intricate decorative patterns. Iron trellises support a decorative balcony roof.  \\n\nThe west facade is divided by rusticated pilasters into three sections of two, three, and one bay respectively, from north to south. South of the sixth bay extends a one-storey section which serves as a port-cochere . The fenestration at the west facade is similar to that at the main, except with circular arches at the upper level. At the lower level, another circular arch of larger proportions opens at the sixth bay.  \\n\nThe interiors are divided into three separate apartments: two similarly distributed residential units at the first level and a single large apartment at the second. The living quarters, kitchen, and servants\\' quarters of the upper floor are reached via a series of louvered galleries that open to the courtyard . The living room boasts original crystal chandeliers and electric features. Floors are generally of polished wood and ceilings of ornate pressed sheet-metal. The living room windows open to the balcony which has marble floors and iron railings.  \\n\nThe Batiz Residence remains a magnificent example of the architectural trends of the aristocracy of Ponce.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nResidencia Subirá\n\\n\nThe Residencia Subirá (Subirá Residence), also known as Residencia Frau (Frau Residence), is a historic building located on Reina Street in Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the city\\'s historic district . The building dates from 1910.  It was designed by the architect Blas Silva . The architecture follows the Ponce Creole tradition.  \\n\nHistory\nBuilt in 1910, this house was a wedding gift from Asisclo Subirá Ramírez de Arellano  and María Echevarría Alvarado to their daughter, Concepción Subirá Echevarría, and her husband, Manuel Frau de la Sierra. The house has always been used as a family residence and has been home to three generations of this family. It is currently (January 25, 2010) owned by William González and his three sons through his marriage with Mercedes Frau Subirá, daughter of the original owners, Concepción Subirá Echevarría and Manuel Frau de la Sierra.  \\n\nSignificance\nThe Subirá Residence (Frau Residence) is considered a prime example of the architecture of Ponce\\'s aristocracy of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This structure is one of the remaining symbols of Ponce\\'s \"Golden Period\" in which landed families lived in the urban core and large numbers of immigrants from Europe , Latin America and the other Antilles had turned the originally small settlement of Ponce into the cultural capital of Puerto Rico . The Ponce Creole architecture to which this building belongs is vital in itself since it represents the birth of a high-style native architecture, a hybrid of influences rather than the purely Spanish, or spontaneous vernacular expressions of previous centuries.  \\n\nIn particular, the Frau Residence is significant within this genre as it was designed by one of Ponce\\'s most well-known architects, Blas Silva . Silva was particularly renowned among the wealthy classes of the period. His buildings are usually characterized by what is popularly referred to as \"wedding-cake architecture\" of the landed nouveau riche , for the richness of ornament and detail. Other buildings by Silva include the Monsanto Residence and the Salazar-Candal Residence , both listed in the NRHP .  \\n\nThe Frau Residence has been classed as one of Silva\\'s most reserved houses, architecturally, as it is relatively simple and not as richly detailed as others. Rather, it relies on scale and form, and the beauty of the classical elements themselves, more than upon the applied ornamentation to portray the prominence of the original residents. It also remains very faithful to the traditional vernacular house type of the region, in plan and in execution, resulting in a graceful, refined version of the one-storey, full-width front porch house of the southern coast of Puerto Rico. In addition to the local influences, Silva reflects the interests of the Arts and Crafts movement and the academicism of the Ecole des Beaux Arts in the facade treatment, resulting in an austere and grand, yet lightweight elevation. Thus, Silva, as had other foreign-trained architects , succeeded in integrating classical education with the traditional elements of the Spanish Caribbean .  \\n\nThe Residence is also significant based on its location. Its location, only two blocks away from the main urban plaza of Ponce , places the Frau Residence into the \"inner circle\" of the historic urban core of Ponce .  \\n\nDescription\nThe Frau Residence, at Calle Reina No. 107, is a raised, one-storey, stone, brick-masonry, and plaster structure with a flat roof. It is located on the south side of the street between Calle Mendez Vigo and Calle Torres in the historic urban center of Ponce . In plan, the structure is organized in an inverted \"L\" shape around a side court at the rear-left.  \\n\nAn ample gallery raised on a local-stone podium spans the width of the facade, the central one-third portion projecting forward approximately six feet in a square form. Defining the porch is a series of Corinthian columns raised upon a concrete balustrade , one at each intersection of two perpendicular planes. These columns support a full-entablature, ornate cornice and balustered parapet with pommels over each column. Bilateral stairs access the verandah from either side of the projecting central section. The steps contain marble treads and polychrome tile risers.  \\n\nWithin the verandah, four bays are organized into an ABA rhythm of two paired, central bays flanked by singular bays at the extremes. Each bay is intricately articulated in the same manner: a circular arch defined by an ornate hood mould with floral and festoon plaster ornament above. Each bay contains wooden, louvered double-doors with ornate leaded glass panels and a stained-glass fanlight.  \\n\nBetween the paired, central bays is an articulate , full-relief, feminine bust sculpture occupying the spandrel area. Plaster ornaments composed of two small, circular medallions flanking a larger, central one decorate the areas between bays 1-2 and 3-4.  \\n\nIn plan, the living room, dining room, and finally a louvered gallery overlooking the side garden are disposed in sequence from front to rear. Bedrooms open onto the gallery around the court. Interior spaces are large and generally have high ceilings and the floors are covered with Loza Islena (Native ceramic tile) in intricate designs. Of particular significance are the stained-glass panels found at the transoms of the main doors and the circular window in the bathroom.  \\n\nAlterations to the house have been limited to reversible wooden partitions within some of the interior spaces and the installation of modern, metal-based, hurricane impact resistant windows (\"Miami windows\") in some areas. The overall character of the interior spaces has not changed nonetheless, and the exterior of the premises remains faithful to the original design.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nRoosevelt Roads Naval Station\n\\n\nRoosevelt Roads Naval Station , nicknamed Rosy Roads ,   is a former United States Navy base in the town of Ceiba, Puerto Rico . The site operates today as José Aponte de la Torre Airport , a public use airport.\\n\nHistory\nIn 1919, future US President Franklin D. Roosevelt , then Assistant Secretary of the Navy , toured Puerto Rico , visiting Ceiba. When he returned to the White House, he expressed a liking for the terrain where the base was to be located. This was during the World War I-era, and the US could benefit from an air field in Ceiba. While Puerto Rico is a Commonwealth , its territorial rights belong to the US, which made it feasible for the US government to build an air base in Ceiba.  \\n\nIt took many years for the US to become convinced of the need for an air base in Ceiba. When Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany began to invade other European countries, the US, led by then President Roosevelt, considered the idea of a naval air station in Ceiba. With war in the European and Pacific theatres , they saw an airbase in the Caribbean as necessary. President Roosevelt ordered the creation of the base in 1940. In 1941, $50 million (equivalent to $1036 million in 2023) was appropriated to develop a protected anchorage in the sea area between Puerto Rico and Vieques , an area later named Roosevelt Roads by Navy Secretary Frank Knox on 15 May 1941.  On 22 August 1941, President Roosevelt signed a naval works among other things, authorized another $21.97 million (equivalent to $455 million in 2023) for a protected fleet anchorage at Roosevelt Roads.  \\n\nThe base had been inaugurated, but scaled down to maintenance status with a public works office in 1944. From then until 1957, the base endured many shifts, being opened seven times and closed eight times. Meanwhile, it continued as a source of employment for the citizens of Ceiba.\\n\nIn 1957, it was upgraded to Naval Station status. Fort Bundy was located there, but it crossed over to parts of Vieques , a fact that became important in the future. A US military mission, the M3, was located there. It was part of the \"Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station, Puerto Rico Base Communication Department\". M3 had a fleet center, a technical control facility and a Tactical support communications department among other things. The M3 was designated to help Puerto Rico, the US and other Caribbean and Latin American countries to deal with drug trafficking, illegal immigration and other problems. The main purpose of the base was tactical support for land/sea/air maneuvers at the Naval Training Range in Vieques .\\n\nIn 1969, the US Navy established Camp Moscrip which held a rotating US Navy Construction Battalion ( Seabee ).  \\n\nFor the next 47 years the base was utilized for flight practice, as well as other missions and control of the area\\'s air space. In August 2002, a MC-130H airplane carrying seven airmen crashed in the town of Caguas, while en route from Roosevelt Roads to Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla . All seven perished, in the largest air tragedy in Caguas\\'s history.\\n\nWithin the industrial area the drydock, a bombproof power plant, a sewage pumping station, and a machine shop were completed. The drydock, 1100 by 155 feet, and built in the dry, was first used  in July 1943. The power plant, a bombproof structure with 4-foot-thick concrete walls, was equipped with two 5,000-kw steam-driven generators.  The drydock was dedicated on 15 February 1944, and the Bolles Drydock, in memory of Captain Harry A. Bolles, (CEC) USN, who was killed in Alaska in World War II.  \\n\nIn January 2003, Admiral Robert J. Natter said that, with the upcoming closure of the Naval Training Range in Vieques , Roosevelt Roads was no longer needed by the Navy.  Later that year, a military appropriations bill required the Secretary of the Navy to close within six months of the enactment of the act.  The base officially closed on 31 March 2004.  At the time, there were nearly 1,200 active-duty officers and sailors at Roosevelt Roads.  United States Special Operations Command South moved from Roosevelt Roads to Homestead Air Reserve Base .  U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command moved from Roosevelt Roads to Mayport Naval Station .  Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 74 ( Seabee ) moved from Roosevelt Roads to Little Creek, Virginia .  When Roosevelt Roads closed, the only U.S. naval base in the Caribbean was the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base .  From the time that Congress voted to close the base until its closure, Roosevelt Roads closed faster than any other military installation on US soil in several decades.  After its closure, 200 sailors and civilians remained to help in the transition from a naval base to a naval agency coordinating the closing process.  \\n\nOf the former base\\'s property, about 30% was transferred to the government of Puerto Rico and its municipalities, 40% became a wetlands preserve, and the remainder was offered for sale at public auction.  \\n\nUS Naval Forces Southern Command\nU.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (NAVSO) directs naval forces and interacts with partner nations to shape the maritime environment within United States Southern Command\\'s Area of Focus (AOF). With a focus on Theater Security Cooperation, NAVSO works to strengthen and build effective alliance and friendships, develop partner nation capabilities, and maintain US operational access to defend the US.\\n\nU.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (COMUSNAVSO), headquartered at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, was the Naval Component Commander to the U.S. Southern Command, based in Miami, Florida. It provides strategic and operational command and control for U.S. Naval Forces in South America, Central America and the Caribbean.\\n\nOn 10 December 1999 the US Navy established Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command, also known as NAVSOUTH, in a ceremony aboard USS Vicksburg (CG-69) inport Roosevelt Roads. The new organization is responsible for Navy operational forces in the United States Southern Command\\'s area of responsibility (AOR), including Naval Special Warfare Unit Four, a training detachment for SEAL teams from the SOCOM operational area. It oversees US naval forces participating in drug enforcement operations and interaction with South American naval forces, including the annual UNITAS operations around South America. As the Navy\\'s senior representative, Commander, United States Naval Forces, Southern Command (COMUSNAVSO) serves as the principal liaison with the government of Puerto Rico. In January 2004 The Navy decided to relocate U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (USNAVSO) from Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, to Naval Station Mayport , Florida. Since the Navy had to close Naval Station Roosevelt Roads by 31 March 2004, relocation of USNAVSO was a high priority.\\n\nLife on Roosevelt Roads\nRoosevelt Roads Naval Station, or Roosey (pronounced \"Rosy\") as it was frequently called, was home to hundreds of military personnel and dependents. Education for children of those based at the Station was initially provided by teachers who were DOD contractors from the US. Later, more local teachers were hired.\\n\nRadio and TV entertainment on the base during the mid-1970s was limited. News and information broadcasts were provided by Navy and Marine Corps journalists from the studios of The American Forces Caribbean Network (AFCN). Families could tune into the on-base AFRTS radio and TV station\\'s family-oriented shows, or rig an antenna for signals from St. Thomas or San Juan. At one time, the AFCN operated repeater transmitters broadcasting radio and TV to San Juan, and Ramey Air Force Base , located on the west coast of Puerto Rico.\\n\nAt the El Coqui Theater, in the Bundy area of the base, movie goers watched films as swifts, a small batlike bird, flitted across the screen. Bats were abundant on the island, but the brightly-lit screen attracted these small birds whose stiff-winged flight was easily distinguishable from the flutter of a bat. Birds hunt using superior eyesight and the projector provided welcome light for them in the darkened theater while bats who depend on echo-location do not need it and were seen only incidentally. But both served as first-class controls on the persistent infestation of mosquitoes (and Mimis, an almost invisible biting midge with a most painful bite) encountered everywhere on the island.\\n\nThe base equestrian stables were near the golf course aka:Lake Bundy. Most of the \\'horses\\' were technically ponies , although several thoroughbreds, washouts from race tracks, occasionally found a home on base.\\n\nThe base flying club had many members, and met regularly to plan trips and activities. Flight instruction was available to all members.\\n\nThe Vieques effect\nIn 1999, David Sanes , a civilian employed as a security guard by the US Navy, died from a stray bomb while observing a routine exercise. As a consequence of this many Vieques citizens and Puerto Rican activists from other towns ( Ruben Berrios , Tito Kayak , etc.) began activism against the military presence in Vieques, which included illegally entering the live -fire areas at the military reservation. Other important activists included Jesse Jackson , Robert Kennedy Jr. , Al Sharpton , US Representative Luis Gutiérrez D-IL, US Representative Nydia Velázquez D-NY, Rigoberta Menchú and Edward James Olmos (the last was jailed in Puerto Rico for trespassing on federal property). An agreement between the Clinton Administration and the Government of Puerto Rico (then Gov. Rosello) agreed to cease all live bombing on Vieques by March 2003.\\n\nFort Bundy was affected by the protests, because part of it was in Vieques. After Sanes\\' death, there was a struggle between the (State equivalent) constitutional Government of Puerto Rico and the US Government. This was over after President George W. Bush granted Puerto Rico the rights to operate the former military possessions in Vieques, including Fort Bundy, a portion of which was aboard Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. As a consequence of President Bush\\'s decision, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station became NAPR (Naval Activity Puerto Rico), where DoD Police provides security, but is a military installation. On 31 March 2004, the station again became inoperative.\\n\nThe future\nAfter the military left the station, Puerto Rican Governor Sila María Calderón announced that her party, the PPD , had political goals to turn the base into an international airport . This was backed in 2005 by the then-new Governor, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá , who asserted that the area might be converted to an airport. He also stated that Ceiba as a town would serve as an economic and tourist center for eastern Puerto Rico, and that converting the former military base into a civil airport would be part of a plan to open seven or eight large airports in Puerto Rico.

Units such as the United States Air Force 821st Contingency Response Support Squadron, 821st Contingency Response Group, the United States Army 1st Armored Division Aviation Brigade and the 101st Airborne Division \"Dustoff\" unit arrived at Roosevelt Roads. Marines and sailors set up a supply staging base receiving around-the-clock airlifts at Roosevelt Roads.

        "page_content": "Contents\nRovira Biscuits Corporation\n\\n\nRovira Biscuits Corporation is a Puerto Rican corporation that manufactures crackers branded by the same name.  The company is well known for its production of \"export sodas\" crackers.  The company\\'s headquarters are located in Urbanizacion La Ceiba, barrio San Anton , in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico , and its main production facilities are located on PR-10 southbound, in barrio Sabanetas , just south of the intersection with PR-52 exit in Ponce, Puerto Rico.\\n\nHistory\nThe company began in Puerto Rico in 1929 when company founder and Spanish immigrant  José María Rovira Viza purchased a small bakery on calle Villa, in downtown Ponce.   In 1937, José Miguel Rovira , José María Rovira's son, joined the Company and started the transformation into a crackers manufacturer. During the next decade, and throughout the Second World War , the company expanded its product offerings and facilities.  \\n\nIn 1947, the company became a legally registered corporation in Puerto Rico under the name of Rovira Biscuit Corporation and, in the same year,  it built new manufacturing facilities in Ponce.  In 1952 it moved from its original location in downtown Ponce to the Cuatro Calles sector, near Avenida Las Americas. The new facility provided 50,000 square feet of space.  In the early 1950s, further growth allowed the company to start marketing its products to the East Coast of the United States , to satisfy the demand of the large number of Puerto Ricans who had started to migrate there in those years. This was followed by expanding its market to the Caribbean area. In the 1960s, the company added new technology, marketing plans, and management turning \"Rovira\" into a household name among consumers in Puerto Rico. Also in the 1960s, the company expanded its marketing into areas in the United States beyond the East Coast.  \\n\nIn the 2000s a company spinoff, Rovira Foods, Inc., was established to respond to the growing sales and distribution business in Puerto Rico. It represents the \"Rovira\" crackers and \"Eric's\" snacks brand names in addition to over 10 different product brands in the United States, Spain and Brazil . From this point forward, Rovira Biscuits Corporation, became the manufacturing arm of Rovira Foods, Inc.  \\n\nIn 2009, the company invested $25 million in a new 100,000 square feet corporate facility in the Mercedita sector of Barrio Vayas in Ponce. The company had been operating from a facility one-third that size located in the Cuatro Calles sector of barrio San Antón .  The new facility operates 24 hours a day.  \\n\nExpansion\nIn addition to its new facility near the intersection of PR-52 and PR-10 , Rovira Biscuit Corporation now also operates out of a new facility located on the outskirts of Ponce, close to PR-2 . This move is intended to \"improve efficiency and production capacity to solidify [the company\\'s] position as the most important cracker manufacturer in Puerto Rico.\"  \\n\nSales and market share\nThe company has 43% of the cracker business market share of the Island.  International exports account for 32% of the company\\'s sales.  \\n\nProduction\nThe company uses 150,000 pounds (75 tons) of flour every day in its manufacturing of crackers at its 100,000 square feet manufacturing facility.  \\n\nLeadership\nAs a private, family business, the company\\'s board of directors consists of Rafael Luis Rovira, president, and Frances Rovira, Carlos Juan Rovira, and José Antonio Rovira, board members.  \\n\nThe leadership structure is as follows:  \\n\nLegal battle\nIn 1980 Keebler Corporation sued Rovira alleging illegal used of the words \"export sodas\" in its labels. The U.S. Court of Appeals decided in favor of Rovira  stating that in the minds of Puerto Rican consumers the words \"export soda\" had come to be associated with the particular type of craker sold by Rovira.  The quasi- landmark case was won on the basis that \"Rovira\\'s affirmative defense of genericness was not barred by the federal rules.\"  \\n\nProducts\nLegacy\nJose Miguel Rovira, the son of founder Jose Maria Rovira and first Ponce-born member of the Rovira family is honored at Ponce\\'s Park of Illustrious Ponce Citizens .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\n18°1\\xe2\\x80\\xb218\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°34\\xe2\\x80\\xb228\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.02167°N 66.57444°W ﻿ / 18.02167; -66.57444 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nRum\n\\n\nRum is a liquor made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice . The distillate, a clear liquid, is often aged in barrels of oak . Rum originated in the Caribbean in the 17th century, but today it is produced in nearly every major sugar-producing region of the world, such as the Philippines , where Tanduay Distillers , the largest producer of rum worldwide, has its headquarters.    \\n\nRums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails , whereas \"golden\" and \"dark\" rums were typically consumed straight or neat , iced (\" on the rocks \"), or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are made to be consumed either straight or iced.\\n\nRum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland , in Canada. It has associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog ) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo ). [ citation needed ] Rum has served as a medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery via triangular trade , organized crime, and military insurgencies such as the American Revolution and the Australian Rum Rebellion .\\n\nEtymology\nThe origin of the word \"rum\" is unclear. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that it is related to \"rumbullion\", a beverage made from boiling sugar cane stalks,  or possibly \"rumbustion,\" which was a slang word for \"uproar\" or \"tumult\";  a noisy uncontrollable exuberance,  though the origin of those words and the nature of the relationship are unclear.    Both words surfaced in English about the same time as rum did (1651 for \"rumbullion\", and before 1654 \"rum\").  \\n\nThere have been various other theories:\\n\nRegardless of the original source, the name was already in common use by 1654, when the General Court of Connecticut ordered the confiscations of \"whatsoever Barbados liquors, commonly called rum, kill the devil and the like\".  A short time later in May 1657, the General Court of Massachusetts also decided to make illegal the sale of strong liquor \"whether knowne by the name of rumme, strong water, wine, brandy, etc\".  \\n\nIn current usage, the name used for a rum is often based on its place of origin.\\n\nFor rums from places mostly in Latin America where Spanish is spoken, the word ron is used. A ron añejo (\"aged rum\") is a premium spirit.\\n\nRhum is the term that typically distinguishes rum made from fresh sugar cane juice from rum made from molasses in French-speaking locales like Martinique.  A rhum vieux (\"old rum\") is an aged French rum that meets several other requirements.\\n\nSome of the many other names for rum are Nelson \\'s blood, kill-devil, demon water, pirate\\'s drink, navy neater, and Barbados water.  \\nA version of rum from Newfoundland is referred to by the name screech , while some low-grade West Indies rums are called tafia .  \\n\nHistory\nMany historians now believe that rum-making found its way to the Caribbean islands along with sugarcane and its cultivation methods from Brazil.  \\nThe traditional history of modern-style rum tells of its invention in the Caribbean, in the 17th century, by slaves on sugarcane plantations, who discovered that molasses , a by-product of the sugar refining process, could be fermented into alcohol, and then distilled.\\nThe earliest record, in a 1651 document from Barbados, mentions the island of Nevis in particular:  \\n\n\"The chief fuddling they make in the island is Rumbullion, alias Kill-Divil, and this is made of sugar canes distilled, a hot, hellish, and terrible liquor.\"\nBy the late 17th century rum had replaced French brandy as the exchange alcohol of choice in the triangle trade . Canoemen and guards on the African side of the trade, who had previously been paid in brandy, were now paid in rum.  \\n\nAfter the development of rum in the Caribbean, the drink\\'s popularity spread to Colonial North America . To support the demand for the drink, the first rum distillery in the Thirteen Colonies was set up in 1664 on Staten Island . Boston, Massachusetts , had a distillery three years later.  The manufacture of rum became early colonial New England\\'s largest and most prosperous industry.  New England became a distilling center due to the technical, metalworking and cooperage skills and abundant lumber; the rum produced there was lighter, more like whiskey. Much of the rum was exported, and distillers in Newport of Rhode Island even made an extra strong rum specifically to be used as a slave currency.  Rhode Island rum even joined gold as an accepted currency in Europe for a period of time.  While New England triumphed in price and consistency, Europeans still viewed the best rums as coming from the Caribbean.  Estimates of rum consumption in the American colonies before the American Revolutionary War had every man, woman, or child drinking an average of 3 imperial gallons (14 L ) of rum each year.  \\n\nIn the 18th century, ever increasing demands for sugar, molasses, rum, and slaves led to a feedback loop that intensified the triangular trade.  When France banned the production of rum in their New World possessions to end the domestic competition with brandy, New England distillers were then able to undercut producers in the British West Indies by buying cut-rate molasses from French sugar plantations. The outcry from the British rum industry led to the Molasses Act of 1733, which levied a prohibitive tax on molasses imported into the Thirteen Colonies from foreign countries or colonies. Rum at this time accounted for approximately 80% of New England\\'s exports, and paying the duty would have put the distilleries out of business: as a result, both compliance with and enforcement of the act were minimal.  Strict enforcement of the Molasses Act\\'s successor, the Sugar Act , in 1764 may have helped cause the American Revolution .  In the slave trade, rum was also used as a medium of exchange . For example, the slave Venture Smith (whose history was later published) had been purchased in Africa, for four gallons of rum plus a piece of calico .\\n\nIn \"The Doctor\\'s Secret Journal\", an account of the happenings at Fort Michilimackinac in northern Michigan from 1769 to 1772 by Daniel Morison, a surgeon\\'s mate, noted that there was not much for the men to do and drinking rum was very popular.  In fact, Ensign Robert Johnstone, one of the officers, \"thought proper to turn trader by selling (the) common rum to the soldiers & all others by whom he might gain a penny in this clandestine Manner.\" To conceal this theft, \"he was observed to have filled up several Barrels of common rum with boiling water to make up the Leakage.\"  : 26 Ensign Johnstone had no trouble selling this diluted rum.  \\n\nThe popularity of rum continued after the American Revolution; George Washington insisting on a barrel of Barbados rum at his 1789 inauguration.  \\n\nRum started to play an important role in the political system; candidates attempted to influence the outcome of an election through their generosity with rum. The people would attend the hustings to see which candidate appeared more generous. The candidate was expected to drink with the people to show he was independent and truly a republican.   \\n\nEventually, the restrictions on sugar imports from the British West Indies , combined with the development of American whiskeys , led to a decline in the drink\\'s popularity in North America.\\n\nRum\\'s association with piracy began with English privateers \\' trading in the valuable commodity. Some of the privateers became pirates and buccaneers, with a continuing fondness for rum; the association between the two was only strengthened by literary works such as Robert Louis Stevenson \\'s Treasure Island .  \\n\nThe association of rum with the Royal Navy began in 1655 when a Royal Navy fleet captured the island of Jamaica . With the availability of domestically produced rum, the British changed the daily ration of liquor given to seamen from French brandy to rum.  \\n\nNavy rum was originally a blend mixed from rums produced in the West Indies . It was initially supplied at a strength of 100 degrees (UK) proof, 57% alcohol by volume (ABV), as that was the only strength that could be tested (by the gunpowder test ) before the invention of the hydrometer .  The term \"Navy strength\" is used in modern Britain to specify spirits bottled at 57% ABV.  In 1866 the Navy fixed the issued strength at 95.5 proof (defined as \"4.5 under-Proof\", equal to 54.6% ABV).  \\n\nWhile the ration was originally given neat or mixed with lime juice, the practice of watering down the rum began around 1740. To help minimize the effect of the alcohol on his sailors, Admiral Edward Vernon had the rum ration watered, producing a mixture that became known as grog . Many believe the term was coined in honour of the grogram cloak Admiral Vernon wore in rough weather.  The Royal Navy continued to give its sailors a daily rum ration, known as a \"tot\", until the practice was abolished on 31 July 1970.  \\n\nToday, a tot (totty) of rum is still issued on special occasions, using an order to \" splice the mainbrace \", which may only be given by a member of the royal family or, on certain occasions, the admiralty board in the UK, with similar restrictions in other Commonwealth navies.  Recently, such occasions have included royal marriages or birthdays, or special anniversaries. In the days of daily rum rations, the order to \"splice the mainbrace\" meant double rations would be issued.\\n\nA legend involving naval rum and Horatio Nelson says that following his victory and death at the Battle of Trafalgar , Nelson\\'s body was preserved in a cask of rum to allow transportation back to England. Upon arrival, however, the cask was opened and found to be empty of rum. The [pickled] body was removed and, upon inspection, it was discovered that the sailors had drilled a hole in the bottom of the cask and drunk all the rum, hence the term \"Nelson\\'s blood\" being used to describe rum. It also serves as the basis for the term tapping the admiral being used to describe surreptitiously sucking liquor from a cask through a straw. The details of the story are disputed, as many historians claim the cask contained French brandy , whilst others claim instead the term originated from a toast to Admiral Nelson.  Variations of the story, involving different notable corpses, have been in circulation for many years. The official record states merely that the body was placed in \"refined spirits\" and does not go into further detail.  \\n\nThe Royal New Zealand Navy was the last naval force to give sailors a free daily tot of rum. The Royal Canadian Navy still gives a rum ration on special occasions; the rum is usually provided out of the commanding officer\\'s fund and is 150 proof (75%). The order to \"splice the mainbrace\" (i.e. take rum) can be given by the King as commander-in-chief, as occurred on 29 June 2010, when previous monarch Queen Elizabeth II gave the order to the Royal Canadian Navy as part of the celebration of their 100th anniversary.\\n\nRum became an important trade good in the early period of the colony of New South Wales . The value of rum was based upon the lack of coinage among the population of the colony, and due to the drink\\'s ability to allow its consumer to temporarily forget about the lack of creature comforts available in the new colony. The value of rum was such that convict settlers could be induced to work the lands owned by officers of the New South Wales Corps. Due to rum\\'s popularity among the settlers, the colony gained a reputation for drunkenness, though their alcohol consumption was less than levels commonly consumed in England at the time.  \\n\nAustralia was so far away from Britain that the penal colony, established in 1788, faced severe food shortages, compounded by poor conditions for growing crops and the shortage of livestock. Eventually, it was realized that it might be cheaper for India , instead of Britain, to supply the settlement of Sydney . By 1817, two out of every three ships which left Sydney went to Java or India, and cargoes from Bengal fed and equipped the colony. Casks of Bengal Rum (which was reputed to be stronger than Jamaican Rum, and not so sweet) were brought back in the depths of nearly every ship from India. The cargoes were floated ashore clandestinely before the ships docked, by the Royal Marines regiment which controlled the sales. It was against the direct orders of the governors, who had ordered the searching of every docking ship. British merchants in India grew wealthy by sending ships to Sydney \"laden half with rice and half with bad spirits\".  \\n\nRum was intimately involved in the only military takeover of an Australian government, known as the Rum Rebellion . When William Bligh became governor of the colony, he attempted to remedy the perceived problem of drunkenness by outlawing the use of rum as a medium of exchange. In response to Bligh\\'s attempt to regulate the use of rum, in 1808, the New South Wales Corps marched with fixed bayonets to Government House and placed Bligh under arrest. The mutineers continued to control the colony until the arrival of Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810.  \\n\nIn India, rum was not traditionally produced as the production processes used to make jaggery from sugarcane do not produce molasses as a by-product. Rum was not produced in India commercially until the introduction of cane sugar production processes which did. The production of spirits along with the core commodity of sugar allowed for these plantations to have high economic returns. Production expanded rapidly to meet both domestic and export markets (however exports to Great Britain were restricted by protectionist policies). Rum production continued after the end of the colonial era. Today, most spirits produced in India labeled as whisky, vodka, and gin are made with a neutral rum derived base. Old Monk is the primary brand of dark rum consumed in contemporary India.  \\n\nCommercial rum production was introduced into Taiwan along with commercial sugar production during the Japanese colonial period . Rum production continued under the Republic of China, however, it was neglected by Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation which held the national liquor monopoly.  The industry diversified after privatization and the de-monopolization of the Taiwanese alcoholic beverage industry.  \\n\nCategorization\nDividing rum into meaningful groupings is complicated because no single standard exists for what constitutes rum. Instead, rum is defined by the varying rules and laws of the nations producing the spirit. The differences in definitions include issues such as spirit proof , minimum ageing, and even naming standards.\\n\nMexico requires rum be aged a minimum of eight months; the Dominican Republic, Panama and Venezuela require two years. Naming standards also vary. Argentina defines rums as white, gold, light, and extra light. Grenada and Barbados use the terms white, overproof, and matured, while the United States defines rum, rum liqueur, and flavored rum.  In Australia, rum is divided into dark or red rum (underproof known as UP, overproof known as OP, and triple distilled) and white rum.\\n\nDespite these differences in standards and nomenclature, the following divisions are provided to help show the wide variety of rums produced.\\n\nWithin the Caribbean, each island or production area has a unique style. For the most part, these styles can be grouped by the language traditionally spoken. Due to the overwhelming influence of Puerto Rican rum, most rum consumed in the United States is produced in the \"Spanish-speaking\" style.\\n\nCacha\\xc3 7a is a spirit similar to rum that is produced in Brazil. Cachaca also comes from sugar cane. Some countries, including the United States, classify cacha\\xc3 7a as a type of rum. Seco , from Panama, is also a spirit similar to rum, which is triple distilled, similar to some vodka .  \\n\nMexico produces a number of brands of light and dark rum, as well as other less-expensive flavored and unflavored sugarcane-based liquors, such as aguardiente de caña and charanda . Aguardiente is also the name for unaged distilled cane spirit in some, primarily Spanish-speaking countries since their definition of rum includes at least two years of ageing in wood.\\n\nA spirit known as aguardiente , distilled from molasses and often infused with anise , with additional sugarcane juice added after distillation, is produced in Central America and northern South America.  \\n\nIn West Africa, and particularly in Liberia, \\'cane juice\\' (also known as Liberian rum  or simply CJ within Liberia itself  ) is a cheap, strong spirit distilled from sugarcane, which can be as strong as 43% ABV (86 proof).  A refined cane spirit has also been produced in South Africa since the 1950s, simply known as cane or \"spook\".\\n\nWithin Europe, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a similar spirit made from sugar beet is known as Tuzemak .\\n\nIn Germany, a cheap substitute for genuine dark rum is called Rum-Verschnitt (literally: blended or \"cut\" rum). This drink is made of genuine dark rum (often high-ester rum from Jamaica), rectified spirit , and water. Very often, caramel coloring is used, too. The relative amount of genuine rum it contains can be quite low since the legal minimum is only 5%. In Austria , a similar rum called Inl\\xc3 4nderrum or domestic rum is available. However, Austrian Inl\\xc3 4nderrum is always a spiced rum, such as the brand Stroh ; German Rum-Verschnitt , in contrast, is never spiced or flavored.\\n\nThe grades and variations used to describe rum depend on the location where rum was produced. Despite these variations, the following terms are frequently used to describe various types of rum:\\n\nProduction method\nUnlike some other spirits, rum has no defined production methods. Instead, rum production is based on traditional styles that vary between locations and distillers.\\n\nSugarcane is traditionally collected by sugarcane machete  cutters who cut the cane near to the ground, where the largest concentration of sugars is found, before lopping off the green tips. A good cutter can cut three tons of cane per day on average, but this is a small fraction of what a machine can cut, therefore mechanised harvesting is now utilized.\\n\nSugarcane comprises around 63% to 73% water, 12% to 16% soluble sugar, 2% to 3% non-sugars, and 11% to 16% fiber.  To extract the water and sugar juice, the harvested cane is cleaned, sliced into small lengths, and milled (pressed).\\n\nMost rum is produced from molasses, which is made from sugarcane. A rum\\'s quality is dependent on the quality and variety of the sugar cane that was used to create it. The sugar cane\\'s quality depends on the soil type and climate that it was grown in. Within the Caribbean, much of this molasses is from Brazil.  \\nA notable exception is the French-speaking islands, where sugarcane juice is the preferred base ingredient.  In Brazil itself, the distilled alcoholic drink derived from cane juice is distinguished from rum and called cacha\\xc3 7a .  \\n\nYeast and water are added to the base ingredient to start the fermentation process.  \\nWhile some rum producers allow wild yeasts to perform the fermentation, most use specific strains of yeast to help provide a consistent taste and predictable fermentation time.  Dunder , the yeast-rich foam from previous fermentations, is the traditional yeast source in Jamaica .  \\n\"The yeast employed will determine the final taste and aroma profile,\"\\nsays Jamaican master blender Joy Spence .  \\nDistillers that make lighter rums, such as Bacardi , prefer to use faster-working yeasts.  \\nThe use of slower-working yeasts causes more esters to accumulate during fermentation, allowing for a fuller-tasting rum.  \\n\nFermentation products like 2-ethyl-3-methyl butyric acid and esters like ethyl butyrate and ethyl hexanoate give rise to the sweetness and fruitiness of rum.  \\n\nThe fermented product is then distilled. As with all other aspects of rum production, no standard method is used for distillation.\\nWhile some producers work in batches using pot stills , most rum production is done using column still distillation.  \\nPot still output contains more congeners than the output from column stills, so produces fuller-tasting rums.  \\n\nMany countries require rum to be aged for at least one year.  This ageing is commonly performed in used bourbon casks,  but may also be performed in other types of wooden casks or stainless-steel tanks. The ageing process determines the colour of the rum. When aged in oak casks, it becomes dark, whereas rum aged in stainless steel tanks remains virtually colourless.\\n\nDue to the tropical climate common to most rum-producing areas, rum matures at a much faster rate than is typical for whisky or brandy (i.e. achieving a similar level of maturity takes considerably less time). An indication of this higher rate is the angels\\' share , or the amount of product lost to evaporation . While products aged in France or Scotland see about a 2% loss each year, tropical rum producers may see as much as 10%.  \\n\nAfter ageing, rum is normally blended to ensure a consistent flavour, the final step in the rum-making process.  During blending, light rums may be filtered to remove any colour gained during ageing. For dark rums, caramel may be added for colour.\\n\nThere have been attempts to match the molecular composition of aged rum in significantly shorter time spans with artificial ageing using heat and light.  \\n\nIn cuisine\nBesides rum punches , cocktails such as the Cuba libre and daiquiri have stories of their invention in the Caribbean. Tiki bars in the U.S. helped expand rum\\'s horizons with inventions such as the mai tai and zombie . Other cocktails containing rum include the piña colada , a drink made popular in America by Rupert Holmes \\' song \" Escape \",  and the mojito . Cold-weather drinks made with rum include the rum toddy and hot buttered rum .  \\n\nA number of local specialties also use rum, including Bermuda \\'s Dark \\'n\\' Stormy (Gosling\\'s Black Seal rum with ginger beer ), the Painkiller from the British Virgin Islands , and a New Orleans cocktail known as the Hurricane . Jagertee is a mixture of rum and black tea popular in colder parts of Central Europe and served on special occasions in the British Army , where it is called Gunfire . Ti\\' Punch , French Creole for \"petit punch\", is a traditional drink in parts of the French West Indies .\\n\nRum may also be used as a base in the manufacture of liqueurs and syrups , such as falernum and most notably, Mamajuana .\\n\nRum is used in a number of cooked dishes as a flavoring agent in items such as rum balls or rum cakes . It is commonly used to macerate fruit used in fruitcakes and is also used in marinades for some Caribbean dishes. Rum is also used in the preparation of rumtopf , bananas Foster , and some hard sauces . Rum is sometimes mixed into ice cream , often with raisins (creating a flavor called rum raisin ), and in baking, it is occasionally used in Joe Froggers , a type of cookie from New England.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nRío Abajo State Forest\nRio Abajo State Forest is a forest preserve in Puerto Rico owned by the Department of Natural Resources and one of the 20 state forests in the island . It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1980 and constitutes an area of 3,590 acres. It consists mostly of subtropical wet and moist karst forest . Mogotes and sinkholes fill the landscape.   The forest preserve is located in the municipalities of Arecibo and Utuado . In addition to its ecological value the forest also contains a number of archaeological sites.  \\n\nHistory\nMuch of the development within the forest area was made by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) during the 20th century. The forest preserve was one of the five designated forests designated in 1943 by the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration  to preserve the remaining forested areas in the island. This forest also protects a large portion of the Arecibo River hydrological basin.  The remains of the lumber roads cut by the loggers and CCC workers have now become trails.  Due to its value as an ideal representation of the karstic ecosystems in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, the state forest was designated a National Natural Landmark by the United States Department of Interior in 1980.  \\n\nGeography\nRío Abajo State Forest is located on rugged karstic terrain in north-central Puerto Rico, between the municipalities of Arecibo ( Hato Viejo and Río Arriba ) and Utuado ( Caguana and Río Abajo ).\\n\nGeology\nThe forest preserve is part of the Montebello karst, part of the Cibao formation in the Northern karst zone of Puerto Rico and its most prominent landforms are mogotes , distinctive steep eroded hills composed of limestone . Caves, canyons, mesas, sinkholes and ravines are also very common in this type of geology and can be encountered within the forest limits. This is the only place in Puerto Rico where the great Eocene-Oligocene unconformity can be clearly seen.  \\n\nEcology and conservation\nThe forest is home to wildlife that include endangered species such as the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk ( Buteo platypterus brunnescens ), the Puerto Rican boa ( Chilabothrus inornatus ), and a captive population of critically endangered Puerto Rican parrots ( Amazona vittata ). Captive parrots are slowly being released into Rio Abajo in an attempt to form a second population.   \\n\nThe forest is home to more than 175 species of trees, out of which about 47 species are considered endangered or threatened. Some of the most common plant species are the ceiba or kapok ( Ceiba pentandra ), algarrobo ( Samanea saman ), jobo ( Spondias mombin ), maga ( Thespesia grandiflora ), tabaiba ( Sapium laurocerasus ), cohoba ( Cojoba arborea ), and white fiddlewood ( Vitex divaricata ). The forest is also home to one of the four remaining populations of Daphnopsis hellerana , which only grows on limestone, erubia ( Solanum drymophilum ), palo de rosa ( Ottoschulzia rhodoxylon ), and the critically endangered nigua ( Cornutia obovata ).  \\n\nMore than 34 species of birds have been documented in the forest. It is also a key protected habitat to the endangered Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk ( Buteo platypterus brunnescens ) and a number of 60 individuals is estimated to live in the area. Puerto Rican parrot ( Amazona vittata ) populations have been re-introduced into the forest since 1983 as part of a conservation program by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service . The forest is also home to the José Luis Vivaldi Lugo Aviary, dedicated to the breeding of the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for the purpose of developing a healthy population in the area; 43 individuals have been released into the wild as of 2007.    \\n\nRecreation\nThe reserve has a reputation for being a great camping spot (reservations required) and it offers visitors as many as 70 different walking trails that will better enable visitors to observe as much of the plant and bird life in the area as possible.  Some of the trails are the Frank H. Wadsworth trail,  Visitors Center trail, the Cueva del Agua trail, and the Tanamá River trail.  Given the karstic topography of the area, the state forest also has a number of caves such as Cueva del Agua and Cueva Alta.   \\n\nThe state forest is also close to other landmarks and attractions such as Cueva Ventana and Dos Bocas Lake .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

It is the largest river in Puerto Rico by discharge volume. Situated on the north coast of the island, it originates in the northeastern Sierra de Cayey , flowing from south to north, and draining into the Atlantic Ocean , a few miles east of San Juan .  \\n\nRio Grande de Loíza runs for approximately 40 miles (64 kilometers). It has its origin in the municipality of San Lorenzo at an altitude of approximately 3,500 feet (1,100 meters) above sea level. It runs through the municipalities of San Lorenzo, Caguas , Gurabo , Trujillo Alto , Carolina , Canóvanas and Loíza , forming the Loíza Lake along its route, making it one of the longest rivers on the island.\\n\nGeography\nThe Rio Grande de Loíza basin is the largest in Puerto Rico with an area of 751 square kilometres (289.9 sq mi).  The source of the river is located in the Espino barrio of San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico on the eastern slopes of the Sierra de Cayey mountain range, close to Carite State Forest . The river flows northeastwardly through the San Lorenzo batholith , a hilly region of intrusive igneous rock , where it meets with the tributaries of Emajagua and Cayaguas . From here, the river turns northwest towards the Caguas Valley where it meets numerous other rivers and creeks including the Turabo , Gurabo , Bairoa and Cagüitas rivers. North of this, the river is dammed and flows through the reservoir Loíza Lake (also known as Carraízo Lake, after the barrio of Trujillo Alto it is located in). The river finally flows into San Juan\\'s urban area and the Northern Plain of Puerto Rico where it discharges into the Atlantic Ocean .  \\n\nHistory\nThe river is of historical importance due to the number of settlements, cities and towns that were founded along it such as San Lorenzo , Caguas and Trujillo Alto .\\n\nIn the 1898 Military Notes on Puerto Rico by the U.S. it is written that the \" limits of the Loisa River are: On the east, the sierra of Luquillo (situated near the northeast corner of the island); on the south, the sierra of Cayey, and on the west, ramifications of the latter. It rises in the northern slopes of the sierra of Cayey, and, running in a northwest direction for the first half of its course and turning to northeast in the second half, it arrives at Loisa, a port on the northern coast, where it discharges its waters into the Atlantic.

        "page_content": "Contents\nSamuel Morse\n\\n\\n\\n\nSamuel Finley Breese Morse (April 27, 1791 - April 2, 1872) was an American inventor and painter. After establishing his reputation as a portrait painter, Morse, in his middle age, contributed to the invention of a single-wire telegraph system based on European telegraphs. He was a co-developer of Morse code in 1837 and helped to develop the commercial use of telegraphy.\\n\nPersonal life\nSamuel F. B. Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts , the first child of the pastor Jedidiah Morse  (1761-1826), who was also a geographer, and his wife Elizabeth Ann Finley Breese (1766-1828).  His father was a great preacher of the Calvinist faith and supporter of the Federalist Party . He thought it helped preserve Puritan traditions (strict observance of Sabbath , among other things), and believed in the Federalist support of an alliance with Britain and a strong central government. Morse strongly believed in education within a Federalist framework, alongside the instillation of Calvinist virtues, morals, and prayers for his first son. His first ancestor in America was Anthony Morse, of Marlborough, Wiltshire , who had emigrated to America in 1635, and settled in Newbury, Massachusetts .  \\n\nAfter attending Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts , Samuel Morse went on to Yale College to study religious philosophy , mathematics, and science. While at Yale, he attended lectures on electricity from Benjamin Silliman and Jeremiah Day and was a member of the Society of Brothers in Unity . He supported himself by painting. In 1810, he graduated from Yale with Phi Beta Kappa honors.\\n\nMorse married Lucretia Pickering Walker on September 29, 1818, in Concord, New Hampshire . She died on February 7, 1825, of a heart attack shortly after the birth of their third child.  (Susan b. 1819, Charles b. 1823, James b. 1825). He married his second wife, Sarah Elizabeth Griswold on August 10, 1848, in Utica, New York and had four children (Samuel b. 1849, Cornelia b. 1851, William b. 1853, Edward b. 1857).\\n\nPainting\nMorse expressed some of his Calvinist beliefs in his painting, Landing of the Pilgrims , through the depiction of simple clothing as well as the people\\'s austere facial features. His image captured the psychology of the Federalists; Calvinists from England brought to North America ideas of religion and government, thus linking the two countries. [ citation needed ] This work attracted the attention of the notable artist, Washington Allston . Allston wanted Morse to accompany him to England to meet the artist Benjamin West . Allston arranged\\xe2\\x80\\x94with Morse\\'s father\\xe2\\x80\\x94a three-year stay for painting study in England. The two men set sail aboard the Libya on July 15, 1811.\\n\nIn England, Morse perfected his painting techniques under Allston\\'s watchful eye; by the end of 1811, he gained admittance to the Royal Academy . At the academy, he was moved by the art of the Renaissance and paid close attention to the works of Michelangelo and Raphael . After observing and practicing life drawing and absorbing its anatomical demands, the young artist produced his masterpiece, the Dying Hercules . (He first made a sculpture as a study for the painting.)\\n\nTo some, the Dying Hercules seemed to represent a political statement against the British and also the American Federalists . The muscles symbolized the strength of the young and vibrant United States versus the British and British-American supporters. During Morse\\'s time in Britain, the Americans and British were engaged in the War of 1812 . Both societies were conflicted over loyalties. Anti-Federalist Americans aligned themselves with the French, abhorred the British, and believed a strong central government to be inherently dangerous to democracy.\\n\nAs the war raged on, Morse\\'s letters to his parents became more anti-Federalist in tone. In one such letter, Morse wrote:\\n\nI assert ... that the Federalists in the Northern States have done more injury to their country by their violent opposition measures than a French alliance could. Their proceedings are copied into the English papers, read before Parliament , and circulated through their country, and what do they say of them ... they call them [Federalists] cowards, a base set, say they are traitors to their country and ought to be hanged like traitors. \nAlthough Jedidiah Morse did not change Samuel\\'s political views, he continued as an influence. Critics believe that the elder Morse\\'s Calvinist ideas are integral to Morse\\'s Judgment of Jupiter, another significant work completed in England. Jupiter is shown in a cloud, accompanied by his eagle , with his hand spread above the parties and he is pronouncing judgment. Marpessa , with an expression of compunction and shame, is throwing herself into the arms of her husband. Idas, who tenderly loved Marpessa, is eagerly rushing forward to receive her while Apollo stares with surprise.\\n\nCritics have suggested that Jupiter represents God\\'s omnipotence\\xe2\\x80\\x94watching every move that is made. Some call the portrait a moral teaching by Morse on infidelity . Although Marpessa fell victim, she realized that her eternal salvation was important and desisted from her wicked ways. Apollo shows no remorse for what he did but stands with a puzzled look. Many American paintings throughout the early nineteenth century had religious themes, and Morse was an early exemplar of this. Judgment of Jupiter allowed Morse to express his support of Anti-Federalism while maintaining his strong spiritual convictions. Benjamin West sought to present the Jupiter at another Royal Academy exhibition, but Morse\\'s time had run out. He left England on August 21, 1815, to return to the United States and begin his full-time career as a painter.\\n\nThe decade 1815-1825 marked significant growth in Morse\\'s work, as he sought to capture the essence of America\\'s culture and life. He painted the Federalist former President John Adams (1816). The Federalists and Anti-Federalists clashed over Dartmouth College . Morse painted portraits of Francis Brown \\xe2\\x80\\x94the college\\'s president\\xe2\\x80\\x94and Judge Woodward (1817), who was involved in bringing the Dartmouth case before the U.S. Supreme Court .\\n\nMorse also sought commissions among the elite of Charleston, South Carolina . Morse\\'s 1818 painting of Mrs. Emma Quash symbolized the opulence of Charleston. The young artist was doing well for himself. Between 1819 and 1821, Morse went through great changes in his life, including a decline in commissions due to the Panic of 1819 .\\n\nMorse was commissioned to paint President James Monroe in 1820. He embodied Jeffersonian democracy by favoring the common man over the aristocrat.\\n\nMorse had moved to New Haven . His commissions for The House of Representatives (1821) and a portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette (1825) engaged his sense of democratic nationalism. [ citation needed ] The House of Representatives was designed to capitalize on the success of Fran\\xc3 7ois Marius Granet \\'s The Capuchin Chapel in Rome, which toured the United States extensively throughout the 1820s, attracting audiences  willing to pay the 25-cent admission fee.\\n\nThe artist chose to paint the House of Representatives , in a similar way, with careful attention to architecture and dramatic lighting. He also wished to select a uniquely American topic that would bring glory to the young nation. His subject did just that, showing American democracy in action. He traveled to Washington D.C. to draw the architecture of the new Capitol and placed eighty individuals within the painting. He chose to portray a night scene, balancing the architecture of the Rotunda with the figures, and using lamplight to highlight the work. Pairs of people, those who stood alone, individuals bent over their desks working, were each painted simply but with faces of character. Morse chose nighttime to convey that Congress\\' dedication to the principles of democracy transcended day.\\n\nThe House of Representatives failed to draw a crowd when exhibited in New York City in 1823. By contrast, John Trumbull\\'s Declaration of Independence had won popular acclaim a few years earlier. Viewers may have felt that the architecture of The House of Representatives overshadows the individuals, making it hard to appreciate the drama of what was happening.\\n\nMorse was honored to paint the Marquis de Lafayette , the leading French supporter of the American Revolution . He felt compelled to paint a grand portrait of the man who helped to establish a free and independent America. He features Lafayette against a magnificent sunset. He has positioned Lafayette to the right of three pedestals: one has a bust of Benjamin Franklin , another of George Washington , and the third seems reserved for Lafayette. A peaceful woodland landscape below him symbolized American tranquility and prosperity as it approached the age of fifty. The developing friendship between Morse and Lafayette and their discussions of the Revolutionary War affected the artist after his return to New York City.\\n\nIn 1826, he helped found the National Academy of Design in New York City. He served as the academy\\'s president from 1826 to 1845 and again from 1861 to 1862.\\n\nFrom 1830 to 1832, Morse traveled and studied in Europe to improve his painting skills, visiting Italy, Switzerland, and France. During his time in Paris, he developed a friendship with the writer James Fenimore Cooper .  As a project, he painted miniature copies of 38 of the Louvre \\'s famous paintings on a single canvas (6 ft. x 9 ft), which he entitled The Gallery of the Louvre. He completed the work upon his return to the United States.\\n\nIn 1832, after his return to the United States, Morse was appointed professor of painting and sculpture at the University of the City of New York, now New York University .  This was the first such professorship in the United States.  \\n\nOn a subsequent visit to Paris in 1839, Morse met Louis Daguerre . He became interested in the latter\\'s daguerreotype \\xe2\\x80\\x94the first practical means of photography.  Morse wrote a letter to the New York Observer describing the invention, which was published widely in the American press and provided broad awareness of the new technology.  Mathew Brady , one of the earliest photographers in American history, famous for his depictions of the Civil War , initially studied under Morse and later took photographs of him.\\n\nSome of Morse\\'s paintings and sculptures are on display at his Locust Grove estate in Poughkeepsie, New York .  \\n\nAttributed artworks\nTelegraph\nWhile returning by ship from Europe in 1832, Morse encountered Charles Thomas Jackson of Boston, a man who was well schooled in electromagnetism . Witnessing various experiments with Jackson\\'s electromagnet , Morse developed the concept of a single-wire telegraph . He set aside the painting he had been working on, The Gallery of the Louvre .  The original Morse telegraph, submitted with his patent application , is part of the collections of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution .  In time, the Morse code that he developed would become the primary language of telegraphy in the world. It is still the standard for rhythmic transmission of data.\\n\nMeanwhile, William Cooke and Professor Charles Wheatstone had learned of the Wilhelm Weber and Carl Gauss electromagnetic telegraph in 1833. They had reached the stage of launching a commercial telegraph prior to Morse, despite starting later. In England, Cooke became fascinated by electrical telegraphy in 1836, four years after Morse. Aided by his greater financial resources, Cooke abandoned his primary subject of anatomy and built a small electrical telegraph within three weeks. Wheatstone also was experimenting with telegraphy and (most importantly) understood that a single large battery would not carry a telegraphic signal over long distances. He theorized that numerous small batteries were far more successful and efficient in this task. (Wheatstone was building on the primary research of Joseph Henry , an American physicist.) Cooke and Wheatstone formed a partnership and patented the electrical telegraph in May 1837, and within a short time had provided the Great Western Railway with a 13-mile (21 km) stretch of telegraph. However, within a few years, Cooke and Wheatstone\\'s multiple-wire signaling method would be overtaken by Morse\\'s cheaper method.\\n\nIn an 1848 letter to a friend, Morse describes how vigorously he fought to be called the sole inventor of the electromagnetic telegraph despite the previous inventions.  \\n\nI have been so constantly under the necessity of watching the movements of the most unprincipled set of pirates I have ever known, that all my time has been occupied in defense, in putting evidence into something like legal shape that I am the inventor of the Electro-Magnetic Telegraph! Would you have believed it ten years ago that a question could be raised on that subject?\nRelays\nMorse encountered the problem of getting a telegraphic signal to carry over more than a few hundred yards of wire. His breakthrough came from the insights of Professor Leonard Gale , who taught chemistry at New York University (he was a personal friend of Joseph Henry ). With Gale\\'s help, Morse introduced extra circuits or relays at frequent intervals and was soon able to send a message through ten miles (16 km) of wire. This was the great breakthrough he had been seeking.  Morse and Gale were soon joined by Alfred Vail , an enthusiastic young man with excellent skills, insights, and money.\\n\nAt the Speedwell Ironworks in Morristown, New Jersey on January 11, 1838, Morse and Vail made the first public demonstration of the electric telegraph. Although Morse and Alfred Vail had done most of the research and development in the ironworks facilities, they chose a nearby factory house as the demonstration site. Without the repeater , Morse devised a system of electromagnetic relays. This was the key innovation, as it freed the technology from being limited by distance in sending messages.  The range of the telegraph was limited to two miles (3.2 km), and the inventors had pulled two miles (3.2 km) of wires inside the factory house through an elaborate scheme. The first public transmission, with the message, \"A patient waiter is no loser\", was witnessed by a mostly local crowd.  \\n\nMorse traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1838 seeking federal sponsorship for a telegraph line but was not successful. He went to Europe, seeking both sponsorship and patents, but in London discovered that Cooke and Wheatstone had already established priority. After his return to the US, Morse finally gained financial backing by Maine congressman Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith . This funding may be the first instance of government support to a private researcher, especially funding for applied (as opposed to basic or theoretical) research.  \\n\nFederal support\nMorse made his last trip to Washington, D.C., in December 1842, stringing \"wires between two committee rooms in the Capitol, and sent messages back and forth\" to demonstrate his telegraph system.  Congress appropriated $30,000 (equivalent to $981,000 in 2023) in 1843 for construction of an experimental 38-mile (61 km) telegraph line between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore along the right-of-way of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad .  An impressive demonstration occurred on May 1, 1844, when news of the Whig Party \\'s nomination of Henry Clay for U.S. president was telegraphed from the party\\'s convention in Baltimore to the Capitol Building in Washington.  \\n\nOn May 24, 1844, the line was officially opened as Morse sent the now-famous words, \" What hath God wrought ,\" from the Supreme Court chamber in the basement of the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., to the B&O\\'s Mount Clare Station in Baltimore.  Annie Ellsworth chose these words from the Bible ( Numbers 23:23); her father, U.S. Patent Commissioner Henry Leavitt Ellsworth , had championed Morse\\'s invention and secured early funding for it. His telegraph could transmit thirty characters per minute.  \\n\n\\nIn May 1845, the Magnetic Telegraph Company was formed in order to build telegraph lines from New York City toward Philadelphia , Boston , Buffalo , and the Mississippi .  Telegraphic lines rapidly spread throughout the United States in the next few years, with 12,000 miles of wire laid by 1850.\\n\nMorse at one time adopted Wheatstone and Carl August von Steinheil \\'s idea of broadcasting an electrical telegraph signal through a body of water or down steel railroad tracks or anything conductive. He went to great lengths to win a lawsuit for the right to be called \"inventor of the telegraph\" and promoted himself as being an inventor. But Alfred Vail also played an important role in the development of the Morse code , which was based on earlier codes for the electromagnetic telegraph.\\n\nPatent\nMorse received a patent for the telegraph in 1847, at the old Beylerbeyi Palace (the present Beylerbeyi Palace was built in 1861-1865 on the same location) in Istanbul, which was issued by Sultan Abdülmecid , who personally tested the new invention.  He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849.  The original patent went to the Breese side of the family after the death of Samuel Morse.\\n\nIn 1856, Morse went to Copenhagen and visited the Thorvaldsens Museum , where the sculptor\\'s grave is in the inner courtyard. He was received by King Frederick VII , who decorated him with the Order of the Dannebrog for the telegraph.  Morse expressed his wish to donate his Thorvaldsen portrait from 1831 in Rome to the king.  The Thorvaldsen portrait today belongs to Margrethe II of Denmark .  \\n\nThe Morse telegraphic apparatus was officially adopted as the standard for European telegraphy in 1851. Only the United Kingdom (with its extensive overseas empire ) kept the needle telegraph of Cooke and Wheatstone. [ a ] \\n\nIn 1858, Morse introduced wired communication to Latin America when he established a telegraph system in Puerto Rico , then a Spanish Colony. Morse\\'s oldest daughter, Susan Walker Morse (1819-1885), would often visit her uncle Charles Pickering Walker, who owned the Hacienda Concordia in the town of Guayama . During one of her visits, she met Edward Lind, a Danish merchant who worked in his brother-in-law\\'s Hacienda La Henriqueta in the town of Arroyo . They later married.  Lind purchased the Hacienda from his sister when she became a widow. Morse, who often spent his winters at the Hacienda with his daughter and son-in-law, set a two-mile telegraph line connecting his son-in-law\\'s Hacienda to their house in Arroyo. The line was inaugurated on March 1, 1859, in a ceremony flanked by the Spanish and American flags.   The first words transmitted by Samuel Morse that day in Puerto Rico were:\\n\nPuerto Rico, beautiful jewel! When you are linked with the other jewels of the Antilles in the necklace of the world\\'s telegraph, yours will not shine less brilliantly in the crown of your Queen! \nPolitical views\nMorse was a leader in the anti-Catholic and anti-immigration movement of the mid-19th century. In 1836, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York under the anti-immigrant Nativist Party \\'s banner, receiving only 1,496 votes. When Morse visited Rome, he allegedly refused to take his hat off in the presence of the Pope.\\n\nMorse worked to unite Protestants against Catholic institutions (including schools), wanted to forbid Catholics from holding public office, and promoted changing immigration laws to limit immigration from Catholic countries. On this topic, he wrote, \"We must first stop the leak in the ship through which muddy waters from without threaten to sink us.\"  \\n\nHe wrote numerous letters to the New York Observer (his brother Sidney was the editor at the time) urging people to fight the perceived Catholic menace. These were widely reprinted in other newspapers. Among other claims, he believed that the Austrian government and Catholic aid organizations were subsidizing Catholic immigration to the United States in order to gain control of the country.  \\n\nIn his Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States ,  Morse wrote:\\n\nSurely American Protestants, freemen, have discernment enough to discover beneath them the cloven foot of this subtle foreign heresy. They will see that Popery is now, what it has ever been, a system of the darkest political intrigue and despotism, cloaking itself to avoid attack under the sacred name of religion. They will be deeply impressed with the truth, that Popery is a political as well as a religious system; that in this respect it differs totally from all other sects, from all other forms of religion in the country. \nIn the same book, published in 1835 under the name of \"Brutus\", in speaking of \"the foreign Emissaries of Popery re-warded in their own country,\" said : \"Where is Bishop Kelly of Richmond, Va.? He also sojourns with us until his duties to foreign masters are performed, and then is rewarded by promotion.\"  ( Patrick Kelly was a native of Ireland, and the first bishop of Richmond, Virginia. When after a couple of years, differences regarding questions of jurisdiction arose between him and Ambrose Maréchal , Archbishop of Baltimore, Kelly was offered the recently vacant See of Waterford and Lismore in his homeland.)\\n\nIn the 1850s, Morse became well known as a defender of slavery , considering it to be sanctioned by God. In his treatise \"An Argument on the Ethical Position of Slavery,\" he wrote:\\n\nMy creed on the subject of slavery is short. Slavery per se is not sin. It is a social condition ordained from the beginning of the world for the wisest purposes, benevolent and disciplinary, by Divine Wisdom. The mere holding of slaves, therefore, is a condition having per se nothing of moral character in it, any more than the being a parent, or employer, or ruler. \nLater years\nIn the United States, Morse held his telegraph patent for many years, but it was both ignored and contested. In 1853, The Telegraph Patent case - O\\'Reilly v. Morse came before the U.S. Supreme Court where, after very lengthy investigation, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled that Morse had been the first to combine the battery , electromagnetism , the electromagnet , and the correct battery configuration into a workable practical telegraph.  However, in spite of this clear ruling, Morse still received no official recognition from the United States government.\\n\nThe Supreme Court did not accept all of Morse\\'s claims. The O\\'Reilly v. Morse case has become widely known among patent lawyers because the Supreme Court explicitly denied Morse\\'s claim 8  for any and all use of the electromagnetic force for purposes of transmitting intelligible signals to any distance.  \\n\nThe Supreme Court sustained, however, Morse\\'s claim to such telecommunication when effectuated by means of Morse\\'s inventive \"repeater\" apparatus. This was an electrical circuit in which a cascade of many sets comprising a relay and a battery were connected in series, so that when each relay closed, it closed a circuit to cause the next battery to power the succeeding relay, as suggested in the accompanying figure. This caused Morse\\'s signal to pass along the cascade without degrading into noise as its amplitude decreased with the distance traveled. (Each time the amplitude of the signal approaches the noise level, the repeater [in effect, a nonlinear amplifier] boosts the signal amplitude well above the noise level.) This use of \"repeaters\" permitted a message to be sent to great distances, which was previously not feasible.\\n\nThe Supreme Court thus held that Morse could properly claim a patent monopoly on the system or process of transmitting signals at any distance by means of the repeater circuitry indicated above, but he could not properly claim a monopoly over any and all uses of electromagnetic force to transmit signals. The apparatus limitation in the former type of claim limited the patent monopoly to what Morse taught and gave the world. The lack of that limitation in the latter type of claim (i.e., claim 8) both gave Morse more than was commensurate with what he had contributed to society and discouraged the inventive efforts of others who might come up with different and/or better ways to send signals at a distance using the electromagnetic force.  \\n\nThe problem that Morse faced (the deterioration of the signal with distance)  and how he solved it is discussed in more detail in the article O\\'Reilly v. Morse . In summary, the solution, as the Supreme Court stated, was the repeater apparatus described in the preceding paragraphs.\\n\nThe importance of this legal precedent in patent law cannot be overstated, as it became the foundation of the law governing the eligibility of computer program-implemented inventions (as well as inventions implementing natural laws) to be granted patents.  \\n\nAssisted by the American ambassador in Paris, the governments of Europe were approached about their long neglect of Morse while their countries were using his invention. There was a widespread recognition that something must be done, and in 1858 Morse was awarded the sum of 400,000 French francs (equivalent to about $80,000 at the time) by the governments of France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Piedmont , Russia, Sweden, Tuscany , and the Ottoman Empire , each of which contributed a share according to the number of Morse instruments in use in each country.  In 1858, he was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences .\\n\nMorse lent his support to Cyrus West Field \\'s ambitious plan to construct the first transoceanic telegraph line. Morse had experimented with underwater telegraph circuits since 1842. He invested $10,000 in Field\\'s Atlantic Telegraph Company , took a seat on its board of directors, and was appointed honorary \"Electrician\".  In 1856, Morse traveled to London to help Charles Tilston Bright and Edward Whitehouse test a 2,000-mile-length of spooled cable.  \\n\nAfter the first two cable-laying attempts failed, Field reorganized the project, removing Morse from direct involvement.  Though the cable broke three times during the third attempt, it was successfully repaired, and the first transatlantic telegraph messages were sent in 1858. The cable failed after just three months of use. Though Field had to wait out the Civil War, the cable laid in 1866 proved more durable, and the era of reliable transatlantic telegraph service had begun.\\n\nIn addition to the telegraph, Morse invented a marble-cutting machine that could carve three-dimensional sculptures in marble or stone. He could not patent it, however, because of an existing 1820 Thomas Blanchard design.\\n\nSamuel Morse gave large sums to charity. He also became interested in the relationship of science and religion and provided the funds to establish a lectureship on \"the relation of the Bible to the Sciences\".  Though he was rarely awarded any royalties for the later uses and implementations of his inventions, he was able to live comfortably.\\n\nMorsemere in Ridgefield, New Jersey, takes its name from Morse, who had bought property there to build a home, but died before its completion.  \\n\nHe died of meningitis in New York City on April 2, 1872,  and was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.  By the time of his death, his estate was valued at some $500,000 ($12.7 million today).  \\n\nIn his will he provided an award medal that is presented annually by the New York University to one undergraduate student who shows special ability in physics.  \\n\nHonors and awards\nMorse was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.  \\n\nDespite honors and financial awards received from foreign countries, there was no such recognition in the U.S. until he neared the end of his life when on June 10, 1871, a bronze statue of Samuel Morse was unveiled in Central Park , New York City. An engraved portrait of Morse appeared on the reverse side of the United States two-dollar bill silver certificate series of 1896. He was depicted along with Robert Fulton . An example can be seen on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco \\'s website in their \"American Currency Exhibit\":  \\n\nA blue plaque was erected to commemorate him at 141 Cleveland Street, London, where he lived from 1812 to 1815.\\n\nIn 1848, Morse was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society .  \\n\nAccording to his The New York Times obituary published on April 3, 1872, Morse received respectively the decoration of the Atiq Nishan-i-Iftikhar (English: Order of Glory) [first medal on wearer\\'s right depicted in photo of Morse with medals], set in diamonds, from Sultan Abdülmecid of Turkey (c.1847  ), a \"golden snuff box containing the Prussian gold medal for scientific merit\" from the King of Prussia (1851); the Great Gold Medal of Arts and Sciences from the King of Württemberg (1852); and the Great Golden Medal of Science and Arts from Emperor of Austria (1855); a cross of Chevalier in the Légion d\\'honneur from the Emperor of France; the Cross of a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog from the King of Denmark (1856); the Cross of Knight Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic , from the Queen of Spain, besides being elected member of innumerable scientific and art societies in this [United States] and other countries. Other awards include Order of the Tower and Sword from the kingdom of Portugal (1860), and Italy conferred on him the insignia of chevalier of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus in 1864. Morse\\'s telegraph was recognized as an IEEE Milestone in 1988.  \\n\nIn 1975, Morse was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame .\\n\nOn April 1, 2012, Google announced the release of \"Gmail Tap\", an April Fools\\' Day joke that allowed users to use Morse Code to send text from their mobile phones.

        "page_content": "Contents\nSanturce, San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nSanturce  is a barrio of the capital municipality of San Juan in Puerto Rico . Its population in 2020 was 69,469. It is also the biggest and most populated of all the barrios in the capital city with a larger population than most municipalities of Puerto Rico and one of the most densely populated areas of the island (13,257.4 persons per square mile).  \\n \\n\nGeography\nGeographically speaking, Santurce is a peninsula that is attached to the mainland in the east, where it borders with the Isla Verde district of Carolina . It is 7.6 km long from west to east, and up to 3.0 km wide in the eastern part. The peninsula is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean in the north, with more than five km of beaches from the Condado peninsula in the west, to a point 600 m east of Punta Las Marías , where it borders on the Isla Verde area, and Laguna San José and its northern embayment, Laguna Los Corozos to the east.\\n\nTo the south is the Martín Peña Channel , which separates Santurce from the northern barrios of former municipio Río Piedras : Hato Rey Norte , Hato Rey Central , and Oriente . To the west is San Juan Bay , where three bridges, Dos Hermanos Bridge (Ave. Ashford), G. Esteves Bridge ( Ave. Ponce de León ) and San Antonio Bridge (Ave. Fernandes Juncos) connect Santurce with La Isleta (small island) where Old San Juan is located.\\nIt has a total area of 8.70 square miles (22.5 km 2 ) composed of 5.24 square miles (13.6 km 2 ) of land and 3.46 square miles (9.0 km 2 ) of water area.\\n\nThe topography is mainly flat with low hills toward the central areas and swampy areas to the south along the Martín Peña Channel and to the east near the Laguna San José (San José Lagoon). The highest point is at Monteflores with 23 meters (75 feet).\\n\nSanturce is located along the north-eastern coast of Puerto Rico. It lies south of the Atlantic Ocean, east of Old San Juan and west of Isla Verde . The district occupies an area of 5.24 square miles (13.6 km 2 ) of land and 3.46 (8.96 km2) of water. It is surrounded by six bodies of water: San Juan Bay , Condado Natural Lagoon , the Martín Peña Channel, San José Lagoon , Los Corozos Lagoon, and the Atlantic Ocean with its respective beaches and estuaries.  \\n\nStructures of architectural value and historical importance are located mainly throughout Avenida Juan Ponce de León , Avenida Ashford and Avenida Fernández Juncos .\\n\nHistory\nIn 1760, San Mateo de Cangrejos (\" Saint Matthew \" of the Crabs) is founded and later is named Santurce by Basque immigrants.  It was originally settled by the native Arawak and later by the enslaved people from Africa who were forcibly brought by way of the Atlantic slave trade from neighboring islands now known as the Danish West Indies . Throughout the centuries, the district continued to grow due to its location between San Juan and its southern suburbs .  \\n\nIn 1876, an engineer from the port town of Santurtzi in Spain\\'s autonomous Basque Country region known as Pablo Ubarri arrived on the island to help in the construction of a railroad system and a steam tramway between San Juan and the town of Río Piedras through the center of San Mateo de Cangrejos which prompted the gentrification of the district. Many years after his arrival he was granted the title of Count of Santurce (which is the Hispanicized equivalent of Santurtzi) by the Spanish Crown. With his newly acquired title and influence, the district was renamed after his title (a decision that has caused controversy ever since). The tourist district of Condado within Santurce also received its present-name from Ubarri\\'s title, as the district\\'s name literally translates to \"county\" (which in medieval tradition is land granted by a monarch to a count).  \\n\nIn 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Santurce was 5,840.  The survey was conducted in the aftermath of te Treaty of Paris which had Spain cede Puerto Rico to the United States in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War as an unincorporated territory of the United States .  \\n\nThe United States Army established Camp Las Casas , in the area of Las Casas in 1904. The camp was the main training base of the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry (on January 15, 1899, the military government changed the name of Puerto Rico to Porto Rico and on May 17, 1932, U.S. Congress changed the name back to \"Puerto Rico\") The Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was a U.S. Army Regiment which was later renamed the \" 65th Infantry Regiment \". The 65th Infantry Regiment was segregated. However, a separate division called the 375th Regiment enlisted Black soldiers. The base continued in operation until 1946, when it was finally closed and the Residencial Las Casas now stands.  \\n\nIn the 20th century the conurbation of the San Juan metropolis expanded rapidly beyond its walled confines of Old San Juan to incorporate the boroughs of suburban Miramar , Santurce, Isla Grande , and Condado , along the coast, as well as industrial Hato Rey , with its large sports stadium and modern financial district , and the college town of Río Piedras , immediately to the southeast.  Between 1937 and 1948, Santurce along with neighboring district Miramar became one of the most vibrant areas of the capital.  However, by the 1970s, most of the district had fallen into decay, losing the luster and vibrancy it once had. Many residents left Santurce, fleeing to the suburbs .  By 1980 the San Juan metropolitan area included the surrounding municipalities to the east and west and had about one-third of Puerto Rico\\'s total population; that proportion has grown to two-thirds of the population.  \\n\nIn the early 21st century Santurce saw a period of economic decline coupled with the financial crisis of the local banking  & mortgage system.  In 2009, the district began a period of cosmopolitan revival and economic growth  as many local establishments such as bars, clubs, and restaurants opened their doors due to the importance of trade and tourism. What helped was the decrease in rent, it attracted artists to the area.  \\n\nSince then, Santurce began experiencing a new wave of gentrification and is now hailed by many as Puerto Rico\\'s \" hipster haven\".   In 2018, twenty-two murals were painted in and around Santurce to illustrate Santurce\\'s culture and history.  \\n\nDemographics\nSanturce is one of the top ten most-populated areas of Puerto Rico. It includes the neighborhoods of Miramar , Loíza , Isla Grande , Barrio Obrero , and Condado ,  which are cultural hot spots for art , music , cuisine , fashion, hotels , technology, multimedia, film , textile and startups .\\n\nThe 2010 U.S. Census recorded a total population of 81,251 people living in an area of 5.24 square miles (13.6 km 2 ). It is the most populous borough ( barrio ) in Puerto Rico and one of the most densely populated areas of San Juan, at 15,447.0 residents per square mile (6,931.2/km 2 ).  \\n\nSanturce is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean with over 1,500 people attending two local synagogues. Jews were officially prohibited from settling in the island through much of its history, but many managed to settle in the island as secret Jews .  \\n\nMany arrived from France , the Netherlands , Saint-Barthélemy and Cura\\xc3 7ao after World War II . A minor portion are descendants of Jewish Cubans who came to establishment after Fidel Castro \\'s Cuban Revolution of 1959. Like in many former Spanish colonies founded soon after the Spanish Inquisition , there are some Puerto Ricans who are Crypto-Jews . Recent DNA ancestry has identified a number of Portuguese descendants who arrived in Puerto Rico after the start of the Portuguese Inquisition in 1536. These are descendants of Converso families. There are some who maintain elements of Jewish traditions, although they themselves are, or were raised as Christians.\\n\nSanturce also has a very big Dominican community , along with Cuban , Colombian, Argentine and Chinese communities.\\n\nSanturce has a community of 81,251 of inhabitants living in a land area of 5.24 square miles (13.6 km 2 ). It is subdivided into 40 \"subbarrios\" (sub-districts).\\n\nFor centuries \"barrios\" were the primary administrative division of Puerto Rico\\'s municipalities, however, presently they primarily serve statistical purposes for both the U.S. Census Bureau & the Puerto Rico Planning Board . The most densely populated area lies to the southeast bordering the San José Lagoon and the Martín Peña Channel , while the least densely populated areas are found by the mangrove swamps to the south surrounding the Martín Peña Channel, and the western area of Isla Grande , a decommissioned United States Navy military base.    \\n\nTransportation\nPublic transportation is provided by several bus lines (locally known as guaguas) operated by the Puerto Rico Metropolitan Bus Authority and circulate along the main avenues of Ponce de León and Fernández Juncos among others.\\n\nIn the peripheries of Santurce there is a rapid transit system called Tren Urbano . The Sagrado Corazón station is the terminus of the sole metro system line of San Juan , located in the southeast section of the district in the neighborhood of Martín Peña .\\n\nSanturce is a few minutes away by car from the US territory's main airport, Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport , and from San Juan\\'s secondary commercial airport, Isla Grande Airport .\\n\nCulture\nSanturce is the main residence of two major museums on the island.\\n\nEducation\nSanturce is home to some of the most prestigious private education institutions in Puerto Rico.\\n\nIt also includes notable public schools:\\n\nSynagogues and cathedrals\nSports\nSanturce has the most modern swimming facilities in the Caribbean and fourth in the world. It is an Olympic aquatic sports facility used to host local and international events such as the 2nd A.S.U.A Pan American Masters Swimming Championship. The San Juan Natatorium is located in Santurce\\'s Central Park. [ citation needed ] \\n\nThe district also has a baseball and a basketball team both known as the \\nSanturce Crabbers ( Cangrejeros de Santurce ) because of the original name of the township. They have been part of the community for over 70 years. Both teams have enjoyed great domestic success, the baseball team is regarded [ by whom? ] as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98 New York Yankees of Puerto Rico ', largely in part to the accomplishments of its legendary players, such as Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays [ citation needed ] .\\n\nHealth\nSanturce has an extensive healthcare network which includes two of the finest hospitals on the island, Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital and Pavia Hospital .\\n\nEconomy\nSanturce experienced significant economic growth following World War II. During this period the district underwent an economic revitalization. Tourism is also a key industry based on Santurce\\'s proximity to Puerto Rico\\'s main international airport, Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport , and the smaller Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport . The concentration of hotels are primarily located in the Condado area where there are numerous luxurious hotels including La Concha Resort , Marriott and the Conrad Hotel .\\n\nNotable natives and residents\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°26\\xe2\\x80\\xb227\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°02\\xe2\\x80\\xb250\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.44083°N 66.04722°W ﻿ / 18.44083; -66.04722 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nSan Cristóbal Canyon\nSan Cristóbal Canyon  is a canyon carved by the Usabón River , located on the town boundary between the municipalities of Barranquitas and Aibonito in the central region of the main island of Puerto Rico . Situated between the eponymous main subrange of Cordillera Central and the Sierra de Cayey subrange, San Cristóbal measures 9 kilometers (5.5 mi) in length and reaches up to 750 feet (228.6 m) in depth, making it the deepest land canyon in Puerto Rico and the Antilles or West Indies of the Caribbean .   Home to some of the tallest waterfalls and hundreds of species of flora and fauna in the island, the canyon is government-protected as a natural area since 1978, which came after the site was used as a land fill from 1954 to 1974. San Cristóbal and its northerly neighbor of Las Bocas Canyon are part of a larger canyon system belonging to the La Plata River basin in the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico.    \\n\nGeography\nThe San Cristóbal Canyon is mainly carved by the flow of the Usabón River , an eastward tributary of the La Plata River ( Río de la Plata ), which at approximately 46 miles (74 km) is the longest river in Puerto Rico. The river flow of the Usabón is fed by numerous tributaries, particularly the Aibonito and Barranquitas Rivers, which flow from the south and north of the canyon, respectively. These rivers are named after the municipalities they originate from, to which the Usabón functions as a natural municipal boundary. This river system, along with its wider hydrological basin of La Plata, have sculpted the canyonlands of the eastern Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico. This process has created numerous waterfalls, some of which are the tallest in Puerto Rico. For example, La Vaca Falls ( Salto La Vaca ), at approximately 300 feet (91.4 m), is the tallest waterfall in the island.  This canyon system is much bigger than the San Cristóbal and Las Bocas Canyons, and it includes other gorges and steep river valleys such as those of La Plata in Comerío and Arroyata in Cidra . This canyon is notable for being the deepest canyon in the West Indies with a maximum depth of up to 800 feet (200 m).  \\n\nGeology\nBefore the flow of the Usabón River, the area where the San Cristóbal Canyon is located was the location of a former fault line during the Late Cretaceous period. This fault line might have contributed to the inward flow of previous rivers by creating a depression next to a rise of the superficial terrestrial crust along the region which began the process of carving the gorge approximately 90 million years ago. This hydrological process caused the movement of sediments which today are evident in the rich diversity of soil types that are found in the area.  \\n\nHistory\nThe San Cristóbal Canyon is named after Saint Christopher , a 3rd-century Christian martyr and the patron saint of travelers. The ecological systems found within the canyon had been untouched by humans until the 19th-century when the increased agricultural activities of the surrounding mountains affected the sediment flow of the Usabón River. Despite its ecological and geological significance, the canyon was often used as a garbage dump throughout much of the 20th century and, beginning in 1954, it became a landfill. It was not until 1974 that the landfill was officially closed but, by that time, these processes had irreversibly altered the ecosystem of the canyon, and by the second half of the 20th-century, the canyon had greatly lost its biological and hydrological integrity. In 1978 the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources ( DRNA in Spanish) identified the canyon as one of the 28 areas across Puerto Rico that were suitable for protection under Law 150 Section 5 , which ensures the protection of areas of great biological, ecological and geographical importance. Additionally, the Puerto Rico Planning Board approved further restrictions on housing development in the region surrounding the canyon in 1980. The newly protected area was granted to the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust which became responsible for the cleanup, revitalization and protection of the canyon. Additional revitalization and scientific surveys were carried out by students from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico in Barranquitas. The canyon became a regional tourist attraction during the 1980s with small, guided tours to the canyon becoming popular, in addition to the area receiving recreational attention due to its numerous natural pools ( charcas ) and opportunities for rappelling, rock climbing and other adventure sports.  With the development of Para La Naturaleza , a non-governmental managing organization established by the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust in 2013, the canyon and its surroundings were proclaimed a Protected Natural Area ( \\xc3\\x81rea natural protegida ) and one of the 39 nature reserves of Puerto Rico.    \\n\nSan Cristóbal Canyon Protected Natural Area\nThe San Cristóbal Canyon Protected Natural Area ( \\xc3\\x81rea natural protegida del Cañón de San Cristóbal ) is a Protected Natural Area and nature reserve located across the span of the San Cristóbal Canyon and its surroundings in the municipalities of Aibonito and Barranquitas . The San Cristóbal Canyon Protected Natural Area has an extension of 6,881 acres, out of which 3,106 acres are protected under more rigorous laws as a nature reserve. The Puerto Rico Conservation Trust manages two-thirds of the protected area while the municipalities of Barranquitas and Aibonito manage the rest; the organization Para La Naturaleza manages the clerical, tourist and recreational activities of the area while also promoting the conservation and scientific activities that take place in the form of trach-collection tours and bird-labeling and counting.   \\n\nThe steep gorges and rich diversity of soil types across the canyon provide a unique animal and plant habitat that is uncommon throughout Puerto Rico. The canyon is home to around 695 species of plants and 144 species of animals, many of which are endemic to the island and some of which are listed as endangered species which are now protected under the United States Endangered Species Act of 1973 .  \\n\nThe official points of entry into the protected area are Finca Don Félix and the Cañón San Cristóbal Recreation Area in Barranquitas, and Finca Los Llanos in Aibonito, all managed by Para La Naturaleza . The former coffee plantation of Finca Don Félix , located near Helechal, Barranquitas , provides access to numerous charcos, such as Charco Azul , and waterfalls such as El Negrón , La Niebla and El Ancón waterfalls; additionally, it contains hiking trails that provide access to the northeastern rim of the canyon. Cañón San Cristóbal Recreation Area is the closest point of entry from Barranquitas Pueblo , and it contains a native tree nursery in addition to a hiking trail that provides access to Mirador Suñé , a scenic lookout. Finca Los Llanos , located near Aibonito Pueblo , provides access to the southern rim of the canyon.  \\n\nPara La Naturaleza also owns and manages Casa Laboy , a historic residence that serves as management offices and a contact point for scientists, researchers and visitors.   \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The district contains more than 100 significant buildings, including the Church San Germán de Auxerre and the Convento de Porta Coeli .\\n\nHistory\nSpanish colonists established La Villa de San Germán de Auxerre, also known as Nueva Salamanca, in the early years of the 16th century. The town of San Germán grew out of the settlement formally established in 1573, and it is this original urban core, transformed by rapid growth from the 1830s to the 1940s, that comprises the San Germán Historic District.  \\n\nThe district includes numerous homes, among these the noted Victorian-style Juan Ortiz Perichi House on Luna Street, which architect Jorge Rigau once called \"one of the best developed spatial sequences in residential architecture in Puerto Rico.\" Many notable Puerto Ricans came from the San Germán Historic District; among them was Lola Rodríguez de Tió , the well-known poet and pro-independence leader who wrote the lyrics to the revolutionary version of Puerto Rico\\'s national anthem \" La Borinqueña \".\\n\nIn late summer 1898, under the command of General Theodore Schwan , the United States Cavalry traveled through Luna Street, during the Spanish-American War, and Puerto Ricans welcomed the Americans in this district and in nearby Mayagüez, with flowers- believing in the promise of prosperity that would come under American rule. Despite wanting to spend the night in San Germán, the Americans decided to continue moving on, to battle the Spanish.   \\n\nThe San Germán Historic District is roughly bounded by Luna, Estrella, Concepción, Javilla, and Ferrocarril Streets in the western section of the town.   \\n\nLandmarks and places of interest\nGallery\nReferences\nThis article incorporates public domain material from San Germán Historic District .

Directly on the beach in Condado , it boasted an Olympic-sized swimming pool .  Sheraton sold the property to the San Juan Dupont Plaza Corp. of Delaware  in 1979  and it was renamed the Dupont Plaza Hotel .  \\n\nOn December 31, 1986, the Dupont Plaza was the site of the second deadliest hotel fire in U.S. history , started by disgruntled employees in the middle of a labor/salary dispute. The fire claimed 97 lives and left 140 people injured. The San Juan Dupont Plaza Corp renovated the hotel in 1988, at a cost of $9 million, and renamed it the Palm Hotel and Casino . A reopening was announced for early 1989, but it was cancelled on December 19, 1988, when the Puerto Rican government refused to grant the hotel an operating permit, because the owners had only installed sprinklers in the hotel\\'s first three floors, and not throughout the entire building.  \\n\nA massive federal trial over the fire began in San Juan on March 15, 1989. It was one of the largest personal damages trials in US history up to that point, with $1.7 billion sought by 2,300 plaintiffs from 250 defendants, including a maze of corporations and subsidiaries involved in the property\\'s ownership.  AIG , a lead insurance underwriter supplying coverage for the blaze, ended up acquiring title to the shuttered hotel in June 1989, as part of the settlement of claims arising from the fire.  \\n\nIn October 1992, AIG announced plans to completely renovate the hotel at a cost of $130 million  and rebrand it as a Marriott.  The hotel reopened on February 16, 1995, as the San Juan Marriott Resort & Casino .  It was later renamed slightly, becoming the San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino . AIG  sold the hotel to Rockwood Capital in August 2011 for $133 million.

        "page_content": "Contents\nSan Patricio Plaza\n\\n\nSan Patricio Plaza is a 640,000 square feet (59,000 m 2 ) three-level enclosed shopping mall located in Guaynabo , Puerto Rico . The mall is located at the intersection of PR-2 , PR-23 , and PR-20 , and has over 120 stores with its anchors being T.J. Maxx , Capri, Walgreens , PetSmart , Caribbean Cinemas and Office Depot , and Burlington , plus an outdoor shopping area known as \"Liberty Square\".\\n\nHistory\nDuring the Spanish Colonial period, Tomás O\\'Daly was granted land in the vicinity of Guaynabo and O\\'Daly developed it into a thriving sugar hacienda. O\\'Daly and fellow Irishman Miguel Kirwan became business partners in the \"Hacienda San Patricio\" which they named after the chief patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick . The plantation no longer exists. The land on which it was located is now a suburb called San Patricio with a shopping mall, San Patricio Plaza.  \\n\nOn December 14, 1963, while construction started in November 1963, it was officially announced by the president of San Patricio Shopping Center, Inc., James J. Wilson, that arrangements had been finalized for the $3,000,000 financing of the shopping center. Short-term financing for the project was provided by Banco Popular while the State Mutual of America Insurance Company of America was in charge of long-term financing. The shopping center, being located at the corner of San Patricio and F. D. Roosevelt avenues, would be planned to have several establishments. Among those establishments there would be: a Pueblo supermarket , a New York Department Stores ; a Kmart discount department store , a Banco Popular , a Thom McAn shoe store , a Walgreens , a Lerner Shops , and a Swiss Chalet restaurant . Pueblo, Kmart, and New York Department Stores, were planned to be the first to open.   \\n\nOn August 14, 1964, the eleventh Pueblo supermarket inaugurated at the shopping center. It was said to be the biggest location in the chain at the time, being 16,000 square feet.  \\n\nOn October 21, 1964, the Kmart inaugurated at the shopping center with a 69,000 square foot store. It was the chains first store out of the continental North America.   \\nOn November 17, 1964, Lerner Shops inaugurated at the shopping center, this store joined the 337 stores the chain had in Puerto Rico and the United States at the time.  \\n\nOn November 27, 1964, the New York Department Stores inaugurated at the shopping center.  \\n\nOn December 3, 1964, developed by Interstate General Corporation, with Theodore Berenson administrating the shopping center, San Patricio Plaza was officially inaugurated. It opened with 16 establishments, 250 square feet of retail space, and parking for 1,500 vehicles. It was anchored by Kmart , New York Department Stores , Pueblo supermarket , and a Walgreens . Additionally out of those 16 establishments it had places such as Lerner Shops , Giusti, Thom McAn , Clubman, Rudes Decorators, Gordon\\'s Jewelers , Bithorn Travel Agency, Park Avenue Gift Shop, Metalfraft Furniture Store, San Patricio Sports, and others. The cost of the entire shopping center exceeded $8 million, it was designed by architect Summer Scheim. The 20-acre estate where the building was located belonged to the Gonzalez Giusti family, one of whose members, Mr. William Preston Giusti, was vice president of the San Patricio Plaza Association. Walgreens inaugurated their 481 store in the chain, being the third store on the island at the time.   \\n\nDuring the night of December 31, 1967, a fire consumed the building where Kmart was located and left it completely destroyed. The fire, which caused an estimated loss of $1.5 million, started in some boxes and sheets of cardboard partitioning walls behind the store outside the building. Gordon\\'s Jewelers , which was located next to the Kmart , suffered minor damage and thanks to the prompt intervention of firefighters, the flames did not cross a wall that divided that store from the damaged Kmart building. As a result, after this event, the mall\\'s management decided to enclose the facilities, adding a lower basement level with new stores which would bring the consumer at the time more alternatives to shopping at the center.   \\n\nOn January 30, 1969, Kmart re-inaugurated their store at the mall after the fires that had occurred.  \\n\nIn the 1970s, taking into account the economic conditions of the period in terms of high interest rates and oil costs, Interstate General Corporation decided to sell certain properties, including San Patricio Plaza, which was sold to the González Giusti family.  \\n\nOn June 18, 1977, a Baskin Robbins opened a location on the mall premises next to the then Felicilandia amusement center.  \\n\nIn December 1978, the mall had establishments such as La Cobacha, Caribbean Music, Super Pet Center, Carrousel, Parklane Hosiery, Kress, Amado Beauty Salón, Candyland, and others.  \\n\nIn 1982, the Felicilandia amusement center located on the mall premises would receive $1,000,000 renovations.  This same amusement center would later on close in the mid-1990s.  \\n\nIn February 1982, a new 5,400 square foot Almacenes González store would open at the mall.  \\n\nIn 1989, the mall changed its logo for the first time ever, for its 25th anniversary.\\n\nIn early 1991, Galería San Patricio shopping center located on Calle Tabonuco in Guaynabo was built at an investment of 1.1 million dollars. The first phase of this project, consisted of eight stores that had an established clientele, including Sterling House, Kitchen Craft, and Marisol Freyre. The first level was dedicated to shops and the second level provided office spaces. The construction of this shopping center was carried out by remodeling of an old warehouse located behind the famous Felicilandia amusement park and was carried out by the firm Carrerá Arquitectos.  \\n\nIn 1994, the first expansion of Galería San Patricio was completed, this included the two floors of the wing where Uno Chicago Grill was located. With the creation of this new area, and in addition to Uno, came four additional stores, among them the then existing \"Bath, Dreams, And\\xe2\\x80 6\" store.  \\n\nIn 1994, the mall changed its logo once again, the mall was given a $43 million dollar renovation and expansion, which included the addition of a food court which opened the same year. The mall\\'s first St. Patrick\\'s Day celebrations would be held in March 1995, which would introduce the mall's \"Patrick\" mascot character. A Caribbean Cinemas location would open in 1997. \\n\nOn June 21, 2001, it was reported that San Patricio Plaza had announced it would begin that January a $60 million third phase of its then ongoing expansion that included a 10.5-story, 150,000 square foot office building, a 25,000 square foot retail strip, and a multilevel parking area for 1,100 vehicles.  \\n\nIn 2003, another expansion phase of Galería San Patricio began, which was completed later that next year which connected the Santander Tower to the San Patricio lobby. In addition to having become a much larger, beautiful and welcoming place, this new remodeling added space for the restaurants, shops, jewelry stores and personal care salons, which were located there.  \\n\nOn November 4, 2003, Bed Bath & Beyond inaugurated their store at the mall, the space counting with 41,000 square feet with two levels. This construction had an investment of $7.5 million, of which was to be financed by Banco Popular.   It closed in June 2023 after the company declared bankruptcy alongside its other stores.\\n\nIn 2008, a Circuit City store opened at the mall, being the first of the chain on the island. The store, which opened with 28,000 square feet of space, was located in the area of the east facade, where the then new Walgreens pharmacy was located. It later closed in early 2009 after it declared bankruptcy.  \\n\nIn 2010, a TJ Maxx would come to fill the 28,000 square feet of space left by Circuit City . PetSmart would also open a 24,000 square foot location at the mall this year.  \\n\nOn August 28, 2012, San Patricio Plaza announced a renovation of its Food Court, pedestrian bridge and multifloor parking. By January 2013, the remodelation was completed.  \\n\nOn October 22, 2014, the mall changed its logo again for its 50th anniversary. The entire San Patricio Village was also given a repainting that began in early 2014, replacing the old beige, pink and green color scheme that had been used since 1994, with a new green, yellow and white color scheme. The rest of the mall\\'s 2nd floor, that had remained un remodeled in 2012, was remodeled as well.\\n\nIn 2014, the mall celebrated its 50th anniversary with an exhibit about its history, and a time capsule which contains items from the mall\\'s first 50 years that will open in 2064. A replica of the mall\\'s original sign was created for the exhibition, which was later moved to the pedestrian bridge in 2016.  The exhibit partially closed in 2015. Visitors could still see the history showcase until 2018, when the remains of the exhibit were removed in favor of a larger AT&T location.\\n\nOn January 12, 2017, it was announced that the mall would undergo a $4 million renovation in order to look more modern. It included a new fountain, a new central atrium, new stairs, replacement of flooring and ceiling, exterior improvements, and more. The six ad banners on the fountain area were also removed; and the pink elevator in front of the fountain was demolished. The project officially began on January 17, 2017. The interior was originally expected to be completed in November 2017; however it was completed in March 2018 due delays caused by Hurricane Maria .  \\n\nIn February 2017, the Santander Tower was converted into the T-Mobile Center, following the closure of the former and T-Mobile moving their main headquarters in Puerto Rico from Hato Rey.  \\n\nIn February 2018, the mall started a campaign promoting their then-newly renovated image. A reinauguration ceremony was held in April 2018. The exterior improvements began in August 2017 and were completed in November 2018.  \\n\nIn July 2018, the Caribbean Cinemas location closed for a renovation. The details about the upcoming location were announced in October. It was originally expected to reopen in December 2018, but it actually opened in February 2019. The new location is a Caribbean Cinemas VIP, with reclining seats and a hall sponsored by Alfa Romeo .  \\n\nIn October 2018 the mall started a project called \"Muraleo\" that added paintings across the mall. The project has been repeated with different editions in October of every year since then.\\n\nThe mall\\'s Kmart store closed in February 2019. On December 5, 2019,  it was announced that Kmart\\'s former space would be remodeled into an outdoor shopping area called \"The Square at San Patricio Plaza\", with an investment of $12 million.  Construction was expected to begin in early 2020 and would have been completed in late 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic , this project was postponed for a year. Several enhancements would be made to the Village as well.\\n\nOn October 20, 2020, it was announced that the mall\\'s Village would undergo an enhancement project and would be made in collaboration with Guaynabo\\'s government.  \\n\nConstruction on the \"The Square\" area officially began in September 2021 after being delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic , following the former Kmart building\\'s demolition which began in May.  \\n\nIn June 2023, it was announced that construction on the Square area was almost completed and the first tenants would open during the coming months. It was also announced that the area would be renamed \"Liberty Square\" as Liberty Puerto Rico would be sponsoring it.  \\nIt was also announced on June 5, 2023, that a McDonald\\'s would open in the former site of Pizza Hut by the end of 2023 or  Spring of 2024. The new location will be the first one in Puerto Rico to be based upon a new prototype design.  It officially opened on April 18, 2024.  \\nThe chain previously operated in the mall\\'s Food Court from 2006  until the Food Court\\'s remodel in 2012.\\n\nOn October 22, 2023, it was announced that the former Bed Bath & Beyond location would be replaced by Burlington in 2024.   The store was inaugurated on June 21, 2024.  \\n\nFelicilandia\nOpened in 1972, Felicilandia, an amusement park, was located on the grounds of the San Patricio Plaza for about two decades.   \\n\nIn 1991, a storage building behind Felicilandia was bought by the owners of San Patricio Plaza and converted into another part of the mall, a two-story building right by the amusement park which added eight stores and offices to the mall.  \\n\nFelicilandia was a year-round attraction which remained open for two decades. When it closed in the mid-1990s, some of the amusement rides were relocated for use elsewhere.  \\n\nAn exhibit at the San Patricio Plaza created in 2014 and closed in 2018 included pictures and a little history of when Felicilandia was there.  Located in Guaynabo, a highly populated municipality, Felicilandia is a place steeped in nostalgia for some residents of Puerto Rico.   \\n\nThe park had a ferris wheel , bumper cars , mini-planes, a main roller coaster , a children\\'s roller coaster, a children\\'s ride where kids could drive cars up and down a play mountain, with a bridge included.\\n\nCurrent anchors\nFormer anchors\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

This is a secondary or second-growth forest is located in the Gobernador Piñero district of San Juan , between the neighborhoods of Villa Borinquen, Caparra Heights and Borinquen Towers complex. The urban forest has entrances on Roosevelt Avenue and Ensenada Street. The forest extends to almost 70 acres and it is the smallest protected area in the Puerto Rico state forest system. One of the most distinctive features of the forest is the mogote on its northern edge which can be observed from many parts of San Juan and Guaynabo .  The forest is part of the Northern Karst .\\n\nHistory\nThe site of the forest was first developed for agriculture and cattle grazing and used to be a farm called Finca San Patricio . There used to be three mogotes on the site but two were destroyed to make way for the construction of the Villa Borinquen neighborhood and the Borinquen Towers complex. The third mogote still exists and it hosts a communications tower. The rest of the land was originally acquired by the US Army with the intention of developing residences for nearby Fort Buchanan .  In 1962 the city of San Juan was experiencing a population boom and urban sprawl destroyed much of the original forest areas of the region. The area where the forest is located was not spared as if it was cleared to make way for more neighborhoods, and the only part of the forest to remain relatively untouched was that around the only remaining mogote. In 1960, the army left and abandoned the residences there and from 1974 to 1999 most of those residences were demolished.  At the time the land was owned by the governmental Corporation for Housing and Urban Development  or CRUV (today known as the Puerto Rico Department of Housing ) and the land was intended to be developed to build housing of social interest but these were never built and the modern forest started to grow in the abandoned land. The area was considered one of the last green zones in San Juan and as such in 1998 the environmentalist group Ciudadanos Pro Bosque San Patricio ,  along with scientists and local residents, pushed to have the land be proclaimed a forest preserve. On August 3, 2000, the forest is proclaimed through an executive order and granted to the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA) to manage and preserve the secondary forest and its ecology. The goal of this proclamation is to preserve the forest for the purpose of recreation and scientific research.  After being closed due to the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, the forest has recently been revitalized and it re-opened in April of 2021.  \\n\nGeology\nThere are three kinds of geological units in the forest: alluvial fan deposits composed of red-colored sandy and silty clay , watered limestone composed of calcarenite and chalky limestone rock which is very common in the Northern Karst of Puerto Rico, and the unit representative of the fossil-rich Cibao Formation composed of chalk , soft limestone rock, and sandy clay.  \\n\nEcology\nThe forest is home to about 70 species of trees, all of which are of secondary growth . Some of the most common trees are flamboyant ( Delonix regia ), pink trumpet tree or Puerto Rican oak ( Tabebuia heterophyll ) and the invasive African tulip tree ( Spathodea campanulata ). Due to its secondary origin, most of the plant species in the forest are of exotic origin, although the species found in higher areas such as in the mogote are native to Puerto Rico. Some endangered or threatened native species have been introduced to the forest for the purpose of their conservation; some of these species are the elegant goetzea or matabuey ( Goetzea elegans ) and the Puerto Rican manac ( Calyptronoma rivalis ), both of which have successfully adapted to the forest.  \\n\nThe forest is good for birdwatching  as it is home to at least 33 bird species, 9 of which are endemic to Puerto Rico: the Puerto Rican bullfinch ( Loxigilla  portoricencis ), the Puerto Rican screech owl ( Otus  nudipe ), the Puerto Rican woodpecker ( Melanerpes  portoricencis ), the Puerto Rican oriole ( Icterus portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican flycatcher ( Myiarchus antillarum ), the Puerto Rican spindalis ( Spindalis  portoricencis ), the Adelaide\\'s warbler ( Setophaga adelaidae ), the Puerto Rican vireo ( Vireo latimeri ) and the green mango hummingbird ( Anthracothorax viridis ).\\n\nThree species of coqui occur in the forest: the common coqui ( Electherodactylus coqui ), the whistling coqui ( Electherodactylus cochranae ) and the red-eyed coqui or churi ( Eleutherodactylus antillensis ). Other amphibian species commonly found in the forest are the white-lipped frog ( Leptodactylus albilabris ) and the cane toad ( Rhinella marina ). Reptiles such as the Puerto Rican racer ( Borikenophis portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican ground lizard ( Pholidoscelis exsul ), the crested anole ( Anolis cristatellus ) and the Puerto Rican anole ( Anolis pulchellus ). The Puerto Rican boa , which is endangered and endemic to the island, can also be found in the forest.\\n\nRecreation\nThe forest has infrastructure for visitors with an information center, parking, handicap access, bathrooms, gazebos for picnics, a plant nursery  and various interpretative trails with information about the forest\\'s wildlife. It is a good place for birdwatching  and educational tours about the various scientific research projects that are conducted in the area. Biking is allowed in the forest.  The forest also hosts occasional educational and environmental events.  It is open to visitors by appointment only (787-268-5353, 787-707-0730) from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekdays and from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on weekends.

The institution existed as an independent entity until 1949, when it was integrated into the School of Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico .\\n\nHistory\nCaptain Bailey K. Ashford , a medical doctor, was a member of the United States Army Medical Corps which accompanied the United States Army when Puerto Rico was invaded during the Spanish-American War in 1898. As the medical officer in the general military hospital in Ponce , he was the first to describe and successfully treat North American hookworm in 1899. [ citation needed ] \\n\nBecause of his clinical investigations into the anemia caused by hookworm infestation, Ashford was inspired to organize and conduct a parasite treatment campaign. It cured approximately 300,000 persons (one-third of the Puerto Rico population) and reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent.  \\n\nAshford and Dr. Isaac González Martínez encouraged the government to undertake a program to reduce hookworm and anemia. They were appointed as the founding members of the Puerto Rico Anemia Commission, established in 1904 by the Insular Government. Ashford had discovered that hookworm infestation was the principal cause of anemia on the island. He served on the Commission from 1904-1906. Medical research in Puerto Rico had its beginning with the \"First Anemia Commission.\"  \\n\nIn 1911, Ashford together with doctors Isaac Gonzalez Martinez, Pedro Gutiérrez Igaravides and Walter King, proposed that the local government create an Institute of Tropical Medicine to further the research initiated by the Anemia Commissions. In 1912, the local legislature approved the proposal and established the Institute of Tropical Medicine .  \\n\nThe President of the Puerto Rico Senate, Antonio R. Barceló , was attending a conference in New York City when he was approached by professors Jose Antonio Lopez Antongiorgi and Abraham L. Goodman from the Medical School of Columbia University. They spoke about the need for establishing a medical school in Puerto Rico where scientific investigations could be conducted into tropical diseases. Senator Barceló became interested in the idea and, on June 23, 1924, he sponsored the legislation which provided Governor Horace Towner , with the prerequisite funding for the school.  \\n\nThe School of Tropical Medicine was formally dedicated in 1925. It was the second school in the United States and its territories (after Tulane\\'s School of Tropical Medicine, 1913  ), founded for the purpose of researching and training physicians in the cause and prevention of tropical diseases. Located in Puerta de Tierra , San Juan, the school\\'s building is one of the few examples of the Neo-Plateresque architectural style on the Island.  In 1926, new legislation expanded the Institute of Tropical Medicine into the School of Tropical Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico, which was operated under the sponsorship of Columbia University. An agreement was made between the University of Puerto Rico and Columbia University in regard to the finances of the institution.  \\n\nHaving completed a 30-year Army career, Ashford assumed a full-time faculty position at the school and continued his interest in tropical medicine.  Together with doctors Isaac González Martínez and Ramón M. Suárez Calderon , he continued his research and study of anemia.  \\n\nGonzález Martínez conducted many investigations and experiments in parasitology , bilharzia , leprosy and typhoid fever .  During his years at the institution, González Martínez founded Anales de Medicina de Puerto Rico , a scientific journal. He was elected president of the Medical Academy of Puerto Rico in 1917. In 1919, he published a chapter on his findings of the Intestinal Bilharzias in the book La Práctica de la Medicina en el Trópico .  \\n\nSuárez Calderon identified the proper and effective treatment of a type of anemia known as tropical sprue , the application of complex methods, such as electrocardiography and radioisotope , to be used in clinics and the identification and treatment of the disease which causes heart rheumatism .  Suárez Calderon continued Ashford\\'s work and investigations on anemia after the latter\\'s death. In 1938, he published his scientific findings on tropical sprue.  \\n\nIn 1927, the institution offered courses in tropical medicine and nutrition. Most of the students continued their graduate work at Columbia University. In May 1930, the University of Puerto Rico offered two degrees of Master of Arts for the students who continued their education and work at the School of Tropical Medicine.  \\n\nIn 1931, William B. Castle and his assistant Cornelius P. Rhoads studied hookworm and tropical sprue in relation to anemia. They were able to treat some patients with liver extract, which efficacy was being studied. Dr. George C. Payne continued to study anemia in 1936 and 1937.  \\n\nThe agreement between the University of Puerto Rico and Columbia University in regard to the School of Tropical Medicine was terminated by mutual consent in 1948. [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn May 1949, the Puerto Rican Legislature authorized the creation of the School of Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico, also known as the UPR School of Medicine . The School of Tropical Medicine was merged into the new school, and admitted its first class in August 1950.  On September 29, 1983, the building in which the School of Tropical Medicine was located was listed in the National Register of Historic Places .  It was later added to the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

Competing in the bantamweight division, he became Puerto Rico \\'s first world champion.  \\n\nEscobar was born in Barceloneta and raised in San Juan. There he received his primary education and took interest in boxing. After gathering a record of 21-1-1 as an amateur, Escobar debuted as a professional in 1931 defeating Luis \"Kid Dominican\" Pérez by knockout . Early in his career, he moved to Venezuela due to the lack of opponents in his division. There he received an opportunity for the Venezuelan Bantamweight championship, but lost by points to Enrique Chaffardet .  Subsequently, he moved to New York and began boxing in other states, eventually capturing the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title. In 1936, he defeated Tony Marino to unify this championship with the one recognized by the International Boxing Union , in the process becoming the third Latin American undisputed world boxing champion. After retiring, he worked as a spokesperson for beer companies in New York, before returning to Puerto Rico in the 1960s, where he resided until his death. He received several posthumous recognitions and his name was used in several sports venues and buildings. In 2002, Escobar was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame .\\n\nEarly life and amateur career\nEscobar was born in La Boca in Barrio Palmas Altas, a sector of Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, to Jacinto Escobar and Adela Vargas.  Early in his life, he moved to Tras Talleres in Santurce, a subsection of San Juan, Puerto Rico. There he received his elementary and secondary education, up until the seventh grade, when he decided to dedicate himself full-time to his sports career.  In Tras Talleres, he began developing an interest in boxing and received instruction in said discipline. Although at this time, boxing was illegal in Puerto Rico; remote places such as a house\\'s backyard or rooftops were used to organize clandestine fights without attracting attention from the local police.  In 1928, a Puerto Rican boxer named \\xc3\\x81ngel \"Sotito\" Soto moved from New York to a house near the Escobar family\\'s residence and established a gym in his backyard. There he gave boxing classes to Escobar and several other young athletes.  After several months of instruction, Soto prepared a boxing card with included three-round fights, in which each round lasted two minutes. In this event, Escobar earned his first victory, defeating a pugilist identified as \"Gombar\" by knockout in the first round.  After this match, Escobar continued fighting in clandestine gyms. He met and was received by Ignacio Peñagaricano, the owner of Victoria Gym.  Escobar received his boxing license through Peñagaricano. On February 16, 1927, governor Horace Mann Towner legalized boxing and allowed the establishment of organized boxing matches. Professionals would fight Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays which, were considered the best days of the week, while amateurs could compete the remaining days of the week without limitations.  As an amateur, he fought in 23 combats, gathering a record of 21 wins, one loss and a draw.  His draw was against Ramón Rodríguez of San Lorenzo and his only loss was in the hands of Pedro Montañez from Cayey , in a fight that took place in March 1930.  \\n\nProfessional career\nEscobar turned professional on September 1, 1930, in a fight card organized at the Victory Garden gym in San Juan. In this event, he defeated Luis \"Kid Dominican\" Pérez, who entered the fight as the Dominican Republic\\'s champion, by knockout in the third round.  In Puerto Rico, Escobar fought in 15 contests, before moving to Venezuela after the popularity of professional boxing declined in his home country.  This move was motivated by Roberto Andrade, who provided transportation to the country. In Venezuela, he fought in Caracas, competing against José Lugo, Sindulfo Díaz, Rafael \"Moralito\" Morales, Pica Pica and Simón Chávez among others.  On November 11, 1931, Escobar competed against Enrique Chaffardet for the Venezuelan Bantamweight Title, but lost by decision. After 17 fights, he returned to Puerto Rico and competed in five cards. But professional boxing suffered another decline in interest, which forced Escobar to work as an accommodator in baseball games three days of the week, generally on weekends.  In the meanwhile, Tony Rojas, a friend of his managers Gustavo Jiménez and Arturo Gigante, convinced them to release Escobar of the contract which bound them.  Since Escobar turned professional while he was still legally a minor, his father had to sign the unbinding agreement. After succeeding in this task, Rojas presented Escobar with a steam boat ticket to New York, which covered his food, clothes and hotel expenses.  Escobar reached New York in early 1934, intending to \"obtain fame and honor\" for \"[his] motherland\", there he was received by Rojas and professional trainer Whitey Bimstein . His first fight in the United States took place at the Valley Arena in Holyoke, Massachusetts on May 7, 1934.  In this contest he was paired against Canadian bantamweight titleholder Bobby Leitham, defeating him by technical knockout in the seventh round.\\n\nEscobar\\'s manager, Lou Brix and his trainer recognized that Escobar could be close to a championship fight once the incumbent, Panamian Alfonso Teófilo Brown , refused to defend the championship against the first contender, which led to it being stripped by the National Boxing Association (NBA).  A rematch was then organized against Leitham. This was an eliminatory card organized by the Montreal Athletic Commission, which was to determine a contender for their vacant Bantamweight World Championship, against first contender Baby Casanova , who attended the card. After scoring three knockdowns in the fourth round, Escobar connected another punch that injured Leitham, after which Leitham\\'s manager surrendered the fight. This marked Leitham\\'s last fight. Following this result, the NBA immediately called for a fight between Escobar and Casanova.  By this time he had gained a reputation as a quick and technical boxer, capable of gathering quick knockouts with body punches if confronted by an unprepared opponent.  The fight took place on June 26, 1934, and it was organized in Montreal, Quebec , Canada. Escobar scored a knockdown in the third round; the fight concluded in the ninth round when Casanova lost by knockout. With this win, Escobar won the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to win a world boxing championship title.  This had a significant impact on Puerto Rico, where it was constantly discussed by the general public. Songs, decimas and poetry were written about this accomplishment.  However, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) and International Boxing Union (IBU) of France didn\\'t recognize the outcome of this fight, conserving Tony Marino and Brown as their recognized champions.  \\n\nOn August 8, 1934, he defeated Eugene Hart by points in a non-title match organized in Canada. This was the first time in his career that Escobar completed a 15-round contest. After this event, he stayed in Montreal expecting to fight against the winner of a matchup between Louis Salica and Bobby Quintana, which was scheduled to take place on December of that year. However, Escobar was forced to cancel his plans after suffering a heel injury when he was hit by a car.  He spent a month in inactivity while recovering, and in the winter he returned to Puerto Rico.  The governor ordered to have all government buildings closed so that public employees could attend a welcoming ceremony.  The event, which took place in Old San Juan \\'s dock, was followed by a parade.  Upon arriving in Barceloneta, Escobar was recognized as a \"predilect son\" of that municipality by the city\\'s mayor, which was followed by a week of festivities in his name.  Escobar pursued a fight with Brown, but his offers were refused while the Panamanian pugilist promoted a campaign protesting the removal of his recognition as champion, demanding to be reinstated.  \\n\nOn August 7, 1935, Escobar defeated Pete Sanstol \\xe2\\x80\\x94who once held, in 1931, the Canadian Boxing Federation and Montreal Athletic Commission (MAC) world bantamweight titles\\xe2\\x80\\x94by unanimous decision in 12 rounds.  However, Escobar still wasn\\'t considered the division\\'s Undisputed Champion because Balthazar Sangchili had defeated Panama Al Brown and was recognized by the IBU. Due to this, Sanstol sent a letter to the NYSAC noting that the fight was of eliminatory nature, even though it was recognized as a titular contest by the NBA and MAC.  Wanting to be recognized as such, Escobar pursued a title unification fight against Tony Marino, who had defeated Sangchili by knockout in his previous fight.  He won the fight by knockout in the tenth round, receiving the \"undisputed world champion\" \\ndistinction.  On November 13, 1935, Escobar became the first Puerto Rican to win a title fight in the first round, defeating \"Indian\" Quintana by knockout.  \\n\nThis outcome made it possible to organize a fight against Louis Salica, it was the first time that Escobar fought a title fight in Puerto Rico.  The card was promoted by Arturo Gigante and Gustavo Jiménez Sicardó. Escobar won the fight by unanimous decision, while Jack Dempsey served as referee.  He participated in Mike Jacobs\\'s \"Carnival of Champions\" on September 23, 1937 and lost the title to Harry Jeffra by unanimous decision.  Shortly after, he recovered from this loss and he returned to the gym; he defeated Johnny Defoe in a preparatory contest.  On February 20, 1938, Escobar faced Jeffra in a rematch organized at the El Escambrón baseball park in Puerta de Tierra . He won the contest by unanimous decision, scoring three knockdowns.  This became an early example of fights that attracted the attention and criticism of boxing analysts, particularly those in New York.  On April 2, 1939, Escobar defeated Kayo Morgan before a sold-out crowd of 15,000 at the Estadio Sixto Escobar , which had been inaugurated three years earlier.  After this fight, he received The Ring Bantamweight Championship, which was presented by the magazine\\'s editor, Nat Fleischer .  Later in 1939, Escobar received a draft notice from the United States Army , ordering him to take a physical exam for possible military service. He and his manager presented the issue to the Puerto Rico Boxing Commission, managing to receive a postponement of two months before surrendering his title.  On April 6, 1940, Escobar fought Simón Chávez for ten rounds in what ended as a draw. Escobar then fought some short non-title fights, of which he lost four, all by points.  On December 2, 1940, Escobar participated in his last professional fight, losing to a ten-round decision to Harry Jeffra. Throughout his career Escobar avoided being knocked down or out in any fight, all of his losses being by decision. In April 1941, he was drafted to the United States Army and participated in World War II .  \\n\nRetirement, death and legacy\nAfter his military service, Escobar confronted problems to meet the bantamweight\\'s limit and retired.  He became a spokesman for a liquor brand and relocated to New York temporally, with his family. Subsequently, he returned to Puerto Rico where he worked selling liquor in bars. In May 1947, Escobar and Jiménez Sicardó co-promoted a fight with the intention of bringing fans back to boxing.  In the main event, Diego Sosa was matched against Francisco Colón García. Escobar was inducted into the Madison Square Garden \\'s Boxing Hall of Fame in 1950.  Escobar continued in his job as a liquor salesperson, during which it was common for liquor salesmen to drink a little bit of the product which they sold in front of potential customers.  This contributed to the development of Escobar\\'s alcoholic tendencies.  His alcoholism would later combine with his diabetes and contribute to his death when he was 66 years old. Weeks before his death, Escobar participated in his last ceremony, where Diego Suárez, president of V. Suárez & Company . gave him a recognition.  \\n\nAfter his death, the town of Barceloneta honored his memory by a statue. His remains are interred at Cementerio Municipal Viejo in Barceloneta, according to a memorial written to honor his life. Escobar became the first world boxing champion in history to have a statue in his honor.  On June 9, 2002, Escobar was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame .  He became the fourth Puerto Rican to receive this distinction and the first to be included in the \"Old Timers\" section.  In March 2005, a second statue of Estobar was unveiled at the Estadio Sixto Escobar in San Juan.  Among the celebrities that attended the ceremony were former boxing world champions Julian Solís and Alfredo Escalera . This statue\\'s location served as a remembrance tribute during the 94th anniversary of Escobar\\'s birth, when a flower crown was placed at its feet.  During this date, an activity was presented by Puerto Rico\\'s House of Boxing in the library of the Pabellón de la Fama del Deporte Puertorriqueño .  Among those who attended the ceremony  were Solís, Escalera and Iván Calderón .  On this date, People Inc. presented a documentary covering his life, which was donated to the venue.  Several buildings and streets were named after Escobar posthumously, including the Auditorio Sixto Escobar . The house where he lived was later turned into a library and museum bearing his name.  \\n\nIn 2019 Sixto Escobar was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.  \\n\nProfessional boxing record\n\\n\n= Indicates the person is no longer alive \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n\\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nStud farm\n\\n\nA stud farm or stud in animal husbandry is an establishment for selective breeding of livestock . The word \" stud \" comes from the Old English stod meaning \"herd of horses, place where horses are kept for breeding\".  Historically, documentation of the breedings that occur on a stud farm leads to the development of a stud book .  Male animals made available for breeding to outside female animals are said to be \"standing at stud\", or at \"stud service\", referencing the relatively high probability that they are kept at a stud farm.\\n\nThe word stud is often restricted to larger domesticated (especially farm) animals, such as cattle and horses .  A specialized vocabulary exists for the studs of other animals, such as kennel (dog), cattery (cat) and aviary (birds).\\n\nHorse stud farms\nDuring the Middle Ages , stud farms were often managed as part of a monastery . At the time, few people apart from monks could read and write, and so they were charged with the responsibility of recording pedigrees . The Carthusian monks are famous for their role in breeding the Andalusian horse in Spain , while monasteries in Bavaria were responsible for the original Rottaler horse. The oldest stud farm in Europe still in existence today is the Mews of Einsiedeln Abbey (1064)  in Switzerland where Einsiedler horses are bred.\\n\nA state stud farm ( \\xe2\\x80\\xb9See Tfd\\xe2\\x80\\xba German : Landgestüt , French : Haras ) is one owned by the government. The first state studs were ordered by Louis XIV of France in 1665. The purpose of the state studs was to make high-quality horses available to local breeders and farmers to accelerate the evolution of local horses. Stud farms which kept a herd of mares in addition to stallions were dubbed \"Principal\" Studs. State-owned stallions were made accessible with low or no stud fees . Germany is most famous for its Principal and State Studs, which have been instrumental in the shaping of the German riding horses and several breeds of German cold bloods. The Hanoverian is associated with the State Stud of Celle , the Rhinelander and Westphalian with the State Stud of Warendorf , the Brandenburger with the Principal Stud of Neustadt an der Dosse, and so on.  \\n\nOther European state studs include:\\n\nThe German city of \" Stuttgart \" gets its name from stud farms.\\n\nAround the world, private individuals have breeding farms of various sizes that are dedicated to animal breeding, usually of purebred livestock.  Some may have originally been founded with government assistance or sponsorship, or owned by political leaders, while others are solely the private enterprise of those who own them.  Some of the largest and most impressive are those dedicated to Thoroughbred horse breeding, such as the historic Claiborne Farm in Kentucky or the Darley Stud , owned by Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , which stands over fifty stallions at stud in facilities located in seven countries.\\n\nStud service\nMany stud farms make male animals available for breeding to outside female animals that are not owned by the stud farm.  Doing so provides an outside source of revenue to a stud farm via the stud fees paid to obtain the services of the stud animal as well as contributing to the overall genetic diversity of the animal\\'s offspring.  At state stud farms, stud service is not only a source of income, but due to the high standards set for breeding animals, has an overall effect of improving the quality of animals throughout an area.\\n\nIn most cases, the owner of the female brings the animal to the stud farm for breeding, sometimes leaving her there for over a month to be sure that pregnancy has occurred.  However, with the invention of artificial insemination and the ability to ship semen, combined with the availability of DNA testing for parentage verification, many breed registries allow semen to be shipped from the stud farm to the location of the female animal, thus reducing or eliminating the need for animals to travel.\\n\nStud manager\nA stud manager or \"stud master\" is an individual responsible for an employer\\'s breeding stock.  The term is usually used for individuals working with dogs or horses .  It is usually applied regardless of gender.\\n\nThe stud manager typically suggests desired matings to the owner, and arranges for the same, whether in-house or by contract with animals standing at stud, approves and arranges matings to the owner\\'s animals at stud requested by outsiders, and keeps all records, including notifying the appropriate animal registries .\\n\nIn a European large or formal household the \"Stud Master\" or manager may be a permanent title and position; in this case this individual is often responsible for overseeing the maintenance of the stables and kennels as well.  Most large stud farms have a full-time individual assigned to stallion management, but many stud managers have either a part-time or contractual arrangement or their duties as stud manager may be incorporated with those of the overall farm or stable manager.\\n\nSee also\nReferences"

Inaugurated in 1864,  it is the second oldest theater of its kind in Puerto Rico,  but \"the largest and most historic in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean.\"   The theater was named La Perla in honor of the Virgin of Montserrat , known as \"The Pearl of the Mediterranean.\"    [ a ] It is located in barrio Tercero , in the Ponce Historic Zone .\\n\nDesign\nThe theater was designed in the 1860s by Juan Bertoli Calderoni (a Ponceño of Italian heritage resident of the city) and it bears a neoclassical structure with an impressive six-column entrance. The building was badly damaged by the 1918 earthquake . However, it was rebuilt in 1940 using the original plans and reopened in 1941 with better acoustics technology. It closed in 2006 for renovations and reopened on 14 March 2008.  \\n\nHistory\nTeatro La Perla was built under the initiative of Francisco Parra Duperón and Pedro Garriga in May 1864.  It was inaugurated on 28 May 1864 with the play La campana de la Almudaina of the Majorcan writer Juan Palou y Coll by the theatrical company of Segarra & Argente.  \\n\nTeatro La Perla served as a stage not only to give life to the theatrical artistic culture in the region, but it also served as a place of assembly for those who were dedicated to the social issues in Ponce and in Puerto Rico as a whole. It served this function both at the end of the Spanish regime and in Puerto Rico\\'s early years as a United States territory.  \\n\nIn this theater, in 1901, Frenchman Eduardo Hervet showed the first silent film ever to be run in Puerto Rico.  The theater\\'s first illumination technical director was Félix Juan Torres Ortiz.  \\n\nIt was significantly rebuilt by Lorenzo J. Vizcarrondo, an engineer, \"a few years before\" 1913, to make up for the deterioration it had suffered over years of less-than-complete upkeep.  It was again reconditioned between 1977 and 1979 at a cost of over $500,000.  After Hurricane Maria it closed for a year, reopening on 1 November 2019.  It was listed on the US National Register of Historic Places on 27 September 2021 (\"La Perla Auditorium and Public Library\") .   \\n\nCapacity and museum\nThe theater has a seating capacity of 1,047 and is now a regular venue for concerts , opera , plays , and various civic and educational activities such as school graduations.

        "page_content": "Contents\nTeatro Tapia\nTeatro Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (commonly referred as \"Teatro Tapia\"), is the oldest free-standing drama stage building located in San Juan, Puerto Rico . It is named after Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (1826-1882), a Puerto Rican poet and dramatist.\\n\nLocation\nThe theater faces east, across from Plaza de Colón, on Fortaleza Street, and was constructed in 1824. It was designed in the Italian style as a horseshoe shaped opera house with three tiers of boxes. A block south lies a brick-shaped former Casa de camineros , house of road-maintainers. To the north-east lies a string of cultural institutions: the restored Casino de Puerto Rico , the YMCA , the Carnegie library , the Ateneo Puertorriqueño , and Moorish-inspired Casa de España . In the northern seaward cliff sprawls the historic and labyrinthine fort of San Cristóbal . The original landward gate of old San Juan lays just east of this site on Calle Fortaleza.\\n\nSignificance\nFor over one hundred years since it was built it was the center of cultural life in the city. Famous soprano Adelina Patti sang there in one of her earlier tours of the Americas during the mid-nineteenth century. Other notable performers to have graced its stage include the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova .\\n\nEmilio Pasarell and Antonia Saez have said that \"the most significant moments of Puerto Rico\\'s musical history are associated with...Teatro Tapia.\"  \\n\nHistory\nInitially named the San Juan Municipal Theater, it was renamed the Antonio Paoli Theater in 1935.  It was subsequently officially renamed the Teatro Alejandro Tapia y Rivera in 1937.  \\n\nAfter years of neglect during the 1940s, the theater was saved from demolition by the former long-time Mayor of San Juan Felisa Rincón de Gautier . It was restored in the late 1940s and has subsequently been used to provide a venue for musical theater , drama and other cultural events. With a maximum capacity of 647 people, this 19th-century theater serves as an arena for cultural events and enchanting ballet performances. The interior audience hall is remarkable for the period. Subsequent restorations (in 1976 and 1997) returned it to its old charm.\\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMedia related to Teatro Tapia at Wikimedia Commons\\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nTeatro Yagüez\nThe Teatro Yagüez in Puerto Rico is a historic building that today is a performing arts theater . It is located at Candelaria Street, (formerly Calle McKinley ) and Dr. Basora Streets, in the city of Mayagüez . The theater building consists of the Lucy Boscana Hall and the Roberto Cole Cafe Theater .\\n\nHistory\nIt was originally erected by Francisco Maymón Palmer in 1909. Maymón\\'s parents emigrated to Puerto Rico from Italy in the 19th century. They settled in the town of San German. Early in the 20th century Francisco tried to build a theatre in the town of San German but was unable due to the existing religious culture then, which considered a theatre as a \"bad influence\\' on the local population. Maymón was an entrepreneur by vocation, having travelled to Europe and the United States in his 20s, and he would not be stopped. He moved to the nearby city of Mayaguez where he established himself as one of the pioneers of the industry of cinematography in the island of Puerto Rico, introducing this new form of Visual Art early in the beginning of the 20th century by showing silent films throughout the nearby towns and becoming the exclusive distributor for \\'Nicholas Power Co.\\' movie projectors throughout the Caribbean islands. The \\'Nicholas Power Company\\' was located in New York. With the help of his business partners Mr. Jose Rahola and Mr. Fundador Vargas, he imported movies from the Pathé Company in Europe , showing them in town centers (plazas) under the stars and at the old Mayaguez Municipal Theater (\\'Teatro Municipal\\'). The latter no longer exists, as it was destroyed in the 1918 earthquake that hit the city and was never rebuilt, hence the Teatro Yagüez became the city\\'s preferred gathering place for opera, plays, concerts, and silent movies.\\n\nFrancisco purchased the land where the Yaguez sits today around 1905. The construction of the first Teatro Yagüez building began around 1907; The formal inauguration was in 1909. Materials such as the cement was imported from Germany, interior ceilings from Italy, tiles and carpets from Spain. An architectural jewel, the Teatro Yagüez began as a neo-baroque style Opera House, years later turning into a silent movie theater. Incorrectly described as art deco style, however, the art deco movement developed years after the theater\\'s first construction and later reconstruction.\\n\nMaymón suffered a great loss, when on June 19, 1919, a fire destroyed his beloved Teatro Yagüez. The World Almanac and Book of Facts states that 150 people died in the fire,  although the records are vague and mostly sensationalist. According to the evidence, investigations after the fire exonerated him of all culpability, and indeed pointed the finger at local entities (namely the Municipal government body at the time), who had an interest in the location (the land) where the Teatro Yagüez stood, and who indeed, tried to purchase the land after the fire, and being unable to purchase it, attempted to expropriate it but without any success. However, there was never any evidence, only accusations and theories never proven. 100 years later, a new theory came forth, the most likely suspect of that fire was the nitrate films stored in a closet inside the theatre. The Teatro Yagüez was finally rebuilt and re-inaugurated on March 21, 1921 after a lawsuit between Francisco Maymón and the Municipal Council of the city, in which Francisco Maymón prevailed.\\n\n\"The current building was the product of one of the most brilliant architects of the era, [José Sab\\xc3 0s Honoré], who designed the new theater after the June 1919 fire.\"  \\n\nFrancisco Maymon\\'s son and daughter, Miguel A. Maymón Camuñas, and Petra Maymón Cernuda inherited the Teatro Yagüez in 1954 after Francisco\\'s passing. In 1959, Miguel purchased his sister\\'s share in the Yagüez, becoming sole proprietor of the Teatro Yagüez.\\n\nIn 1976, the U.S. government sent a Bicentennial Commission to Puerto Rico, who declared the Teatro Yagüez a landmark. Under the administration of Benjamin Cole , the municipality of Mayagüez purchased the Yagüez in 1980 and restored it to its original magnificence in 1984. It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2003.  \\n\nThe Teatro Yaguez has been fully restored and is in use today. It remains as a beautiful reminder of the history of theater and arts of the early 20th century in Puerto Rico. Its stage and auditorium  were renamed as Lucy Boscana Hall in December 2008, in tribute to the Mayagüez-born actress and teacher.\\n\nMaymón named the Teatro Yagüez: La Catedral Del Arte Sonoro . (The Cathedral of Sonorous Art), a nickname that has prevailed to this day as the Yaguez is visually and architecturally, a Cathedral.\\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

When the mall opened its doors on, March 26, 2015, it was anchored by Nordstrom , being their first store to open in Puerto Rico, and the entire Caribbean . The mall was constructed at a cost of $475 million by Taubman Centers.  The mall currently opens at 10:00 AM everyday, and closes at 8:00 PM from Monday through Thursday. On Fridays, the mall is open until 9:00 PM, and it closes at 7:00 PM on Saturdays and Sundays.\\n\nHistory\nThe land where the mall stands today was once a large building complex, originally hosting the 1979 Pan American Games . The buildings were demolished in 1998, in what was then a world-record for the most buildings to be demolished, simultaneously, with explosives.  \\n\nOriginally, the mall project was called Nueva Puerta de San Juan  when it was first conceived in the 1990s. In the 2000s, it was renamed to Plaza Internacional.  Construction of the mall had been delayed for several years due to financing issues and a lawsuit by the owners of the adjacent Plaza Las Americas . Later, New Century Development would file a counter lawsuit, when Plaza Las Americas announced their plans for an expansion.  The project was later given its current name, and finally broke ground in 2012. Original plans had included the construction of an office tower, a hotel and a casino, with work originally set to begin later in 2015, after the mall opened, and completed by 2017; however, this never came to fruition.\\n\n  \\n\nHurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, severely damaging anchor stores Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue ; on October 30, 2019, it was announced that Saks would not be reopening.

On May 7, 2020, Nordstrom announced that it would not be reopening post- lockdown . The mall itself reopened just three months later, in June 2020, with limited initial capacity (as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) and requiring face masks for anyone entering the premises. The second floor of the former Nordstrom is now a children\\'s entertainment center called Brincoteo.\\n\nOn December 8, 2021, local TV station WLII-DT announced that they would be occupying one of the empty anchors for their new studio facilities, beginning in 2022. The facility was unveiled to the public during the station\\'s upfront presentation, where it was announced that the network\\'s new show, La Boveda de Mr. Cash , would begin broadcasting from the facility later in 2022. La Boveda de Mr. Cash premiered on March 1, 2022, live from the mall. The new TeleOnce facility occupies the space of the former Saks Fifth Avenue, and has since been divided into seven different potential studio spaces, on its lower level, along with a large lobby area with adequate space to queue audience members. La Bóveda de Mr. Cash occupies the last available space on the first floor, with work on the second floor expected to begin.    \\n\nSee also\nReferences"

It is also Puerto Rico\\'s highest cloud forest . It is in the Cordillera Central region of the island and covers 8,204 cuerdas (7,968 acres; 3,224 ha; 32.24 km 2 ), of mountains. Toro Negro\\'s mountains have heights reaching up to 4,400 feet (1,300 m) and include Cerro de Punta ,  Cerro Jayuya and Cerro Rosa , the three highest peaks in the island. Nested among these mountains is Lake Guineo, the island\\'s highest lake.  The forest has 18 kilometers (11 mi) of trails, an observation tower, two natural swimming pools , camping and picnic areas, nine rivers, and numerous creeks and waterfalls.  The forest spans areas within the municipalities of Ponce , Jayuya , Orocovis , Ciales , and Juana Díaz , and consists of seven non-contiguous tracts of land.   The largest contiguous segment of the forest is located in the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya.  Some 40% of the area of Toro Negro State Forest is located in Ponce\\'s Barrio Anón .  \\n\nWhen created in 1935 as part of the Caribbean National Forest , the Toro Negro Forest Reserve was managed by the United States government , first via the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration of the Department of the Interior (1935-1942) and later through the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture (1942-1970). Then, in 1970, the Federal Government exchanged with the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico the Toro Negro section of the Caribbean National Forest for some forested lands belonging to the Commonwealth and located adjacent to the much larger federal lands at Luquillo National Forest resulting in the creation at Luquillo of the current El Yunque National Forest .   In 1970, the Government of Puerto Rico\\'s Departmento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales (DRNA) opened the Toro Negro Forest Reserve as a Commonwealth state forest and renamed it Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro (Toro Negro State Forest).\\n\nHistory\nIn 1876, Spanish King Alfonso XII of Spain issued the first proclamation for the creation of forest reserves in Puerto Rico.  The land where Toro Negro sits was originally used for coffee plantations until the 1930s when a program of reforestation was commenced.  \\n\nIn 1934, those lands were acquired by the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA).  The forest started with a total of 2,733 hectares (6,750 acres) in 1934.  In 1935, 1,900 acres (2,000 cda) of private lands were purchased by the PRRA.   The forest was not a separate entity at the time; it was part of the Caribbean National Forest , and was administered by the U.S. Forest Service as the Toro Negro Division of the Caribbean National Forest.   Additional lands brought the total size of the Toro Negro purchase that year to 6,620 acres (6,820 cda),  and at least an additional 1,385 acres (1,426 cda) were in the process of being acquired in 1936.  Between 1934 and 1945 over 3 million seedlings and approximately 19,000 pounds of seeds were sown on 1,856 acres (1,911 cda) of the forest. Twenty-eight species were planted in twenty-nine different plantations.  In 1942, the US Department of the Interior transferred the forest to the United States Department of Agriculture . From 1942 to 1961, it was administered by the US Forest Service . During these years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture continued its acquisition of lands increasing the acreage of Toro Negro.  \\n\nIn 1961, Toro Negro was transferred to the Government of Puerto Rico .  The transfer was finalized on 21 May 1962, when the 6,817 cuerdas (6,621 acres) of land that constituted the Toro Negro Unit of the Caribbean National Forest were signed away to the Government of Puerto Rico by the Federal Government. Of these 6,817 cuerdas (6,621 acres), 1,996 cuerdas (1,939 acres) were exchanged for 1,614 cuerdas (1,568 acres) located adjacent to the Luquillo Unit of the Caribbean National Forest. The remaining 4,821 cuerdas (4,682 acres) were ceded to Puerto Rico\\'s Department of Agriculture for forestry purposes. This resulted in the Toro Negro State Forest.  Since 1962, approximately 120 cuerdas have been planted to eucalyptus , mahoe , kadam and Honduran pine .  In 1962, Toro Negro had 6,817 cuerdas (6,621 acres), representing 11.32% of Puerto Rico\\'s state forests.  In 1962 the Area Recreacional Doña Juana was added to Toro Negro.  In April 1970, a land exchange which included the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture purchase and transfer of 1,677 acres (1,727 cda) forest lands adjacent to Luquillo Experimental Forest in exchange for the complete transfer of Toro Negro forest lands to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.   \\n\nThe lower elevations of Toro Negro used to be important coffee-producing plantations, however, the entire forest is especially critical for water and soil conservation.  Today, the amount of tree foliage coverage in the forest ranges from 81% in the moist forest zone to 99% in the lower montane wet forest zone.  The forest was named for the Río Toro Negro , one of nine rivers that flow out of the forest, and the name of one of the barrios in the Ciales portion of the forest.  \\n\nProtected area\nToro Negro is a protected area under the law.  The forest has a protected status of \"IV\" (\"Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources\") according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) convention.    Ecological protection is managed and enforced by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources .\\n\nThrough the parcelero (from the Spanish root for \" parcel \", or land lot) program, people who were living in the lands being incorporated into the reserve during the federal government land acquisitions of 1935 were allowed to stay in their places when forest protection went into effect.  \\n\nIn January 1999, a bill in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives sought to increase the size of the protected area by unifying the Toro Negro, Guilarte , and Pueblo de Adjuntas State Forests.  In a March 2008 study by its International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF), the U.S. Department of Agriculture classified Toro Negro State Forest as a Commonwealth of Puerto Rico forest of \"Status 2\", s status it defines as \"an area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a primarily natural state, but which may receive use or management practices that degrade the quality of existing natural communities\".  As of 2013, there were ongoing governmental initiatives in place to acquire, from private owners, additional lands adjacent to the Toro Negro State Forest to increase the protected area of the forest as well as to create a wildlife forest corridor that would join Toro Negro with the nearby Tres Picachos and Guilarte state forests through plans such as the federal Forest Legacy Areas initiative.  \\n\nLocation\nToro Negro is located in the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico and it has a total area of 8,203.6977 cuerdas (3,224.3778 ha; 7,967.6110 acres).  It is located in remote areas of the Cordillera Central mountain range. The forest office is at km. 32.4 of Route PR-143 , east of the intersection with Route PR-149 .  The forest distribution encompasses a range from 18°07\\'30\" N and 18°15\\'00\" N to 66°30\\'00\" W and 66°37\\'30\" W.  The forest ranger\\'s office and visitors\\' area are located on Puerto Rico Highway 143 Km 32.4 in Barrio Ala de la Piedra, Orocovis at 18.17342°N, 66.49231°W ( 18°10\\xe2\\x80\\xb224.312\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°29\\xe2\\x80\\xb232.316\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.17342000°N 66.49231000°W ﻿ / 18.17342000; -66.49231000 ).  The largest sections of the forest are located in the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya, both of which are municipalities in the Puerto Rico Tourism Company\\'s Porta Caribe tourism zone.   Cerro de Punta 1,338 meters (4,390 ft), the highest peak in Puerto Rico, is located in the western section of the forest and the lowest elevation is found at the south edge of the forest near Salto de Inabón (Inabón Falls), an altitude of approximately 440 meters (1,440 ft).  \\n\nForest types\nFour vegetation associations have been delineated in two bioclimatic life zones.  The two climatic biome zones are: the subtropical moist forest life zone (31% of the forest) and the lower mountain wet forest life zone (the remaining 69% of the forest). The topography is accentuated by a large number of steep slopes and high waterfalls.  Toro Negro subforests are catalogued on the basis of their elevation and content. From Cerro Maravilla , one of the tallest peaks in the forest, four of Puerto Rico\\'s distinct forest types can be seen: Bosque Tabonuco , Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia , Bosque Sierra de Palmas , and Bosque enano .\\n\nAt the lower elevations of the forest (below 2,000 feet [610 m] above sea level) stands the Bosque Tabonuco forest which is dominated by the majestic Tabonuco tree ( Dacryodes excelsa ) that can reach up to 100 feet (30 m) and grows primarily in protected sites at low elevations. The Tabonuco forest has many of the characteristics for which tropical rain forests are noted. The forest canopy has three levels: an upper level that may be as much as 35% Tabonuco, a lower canopy, and an under story. The second most prominent tree in this forest type, the Montillo ( Sloanea berteroana ), has large buttress roots, typical of many rain forest trees. Such roots help support the heavy canopy of large trees growing in very wet soil. The forest floor is only scarcely vegetated, but the forest canopy is rich with aerial plants: bromeliads, orchids, vines, and arboreal ferns.  The tabonuco type dominates in the subtropical wet life zone.  \\n\nAbove 2,000 feet (610 m) is the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest. Tree height in the Micropholis Buchenavia forest is less than 50 feet (15 m), and the layers of the forest canopy are less distinct than in the Tabonuco type.  Micropholis and Buchenavia ( Granadillo ) are the dominant species in this lower montane zonal vegetation association.  \\n\nAt about the same elevation as the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest (above 2,000 feet [610 m]), but on very steep slopes, are the Sierra de Palmas forests dominated by the sierra palm ( Prestoea montana ). Sometimes called palm-breaker, this forest type may reach 50 feet (15 m) in height.  The Sierra de Palmas covers the largest area of all forest types in Toro Negro. The palm forest is distinguishable at a great distance by the form and size of leaves and by the general pale green color of the foliage. Below 650 meters (2,130 ft) elevation the palms appear as scattered elements; however at higher elevations the sierra palm becomes a dominant species over a large area.  The trunk of the sierra palm is straight, erect, cylindrical and attains heights of 10-15 metres (33-49 ft). The pinnate leaves are mostly 2.0-2.5 metres (6.6-8.2 ft) long and cast a dense shade on the ground. The palm forest, nearly always a single species dominant is normally open and free from undergrowth of any kind. The globose fruits are somewhat more than one centimeter in diameter and produced in great abundance.  \\n\nAt the highest elevations, near the top of Cerro de Punta , Cerro Maravilla and similar peaks, grows the Bosque enano forest , also known as dwarf forest, cloud forest , elfin forest and moss forest . This forest type is composed of very dense stands of small, stunted trees and shrubs. The cloud forest has many of the same tree species as the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest, but growth is limited by adverse climate\\xe2\\x80\\x94heavy rain, strong winds, and almost constant cloud cover.  \\n\nThe dwarf or cloud forest developed in the higher peaks of the Central Cordillera is quite different in general appearance from the cloud forest of Sierra Luquillo Mountains due to the less rigorous environment in Toro Negro. The physical effect of the wind is much reduced; the shrubs are neither bent nor shorn to an even surface, but are essentially erect and their crowns are rounded and uneven in outline. The mosses are reduced to a thin mantle on the more sheltered trunks and are absent in many places, while the great mats of Selaginella are completely lacking.  \\n\nIn the Toro Negro forest, only the most inaccessible mountain tops have never been cleared. Most of the lower areas are subject to the familiar routine of logging, clearing, burning, and grazing or semi-permanent cultivation. Most of the forest lands in Toro Negro rise above the upper limit of successful coffee cultivation.  \\n\nGeology\nToro Negro State Forest has both deep soils and surface soils. Deep soils are derived from volcanic igneous rock , fine-grained. These contain high amounts of permeable clay, low amounts of sand, silt, and high amounts of iron and aluminum, but little silica. The surface soils are acidic and brittle while the subsoil is acidic and heavy, but permeable. Its hills are mostly steep. Usually the top soil is lost by erosion.   \\n\nThere are nine rivers that flow south ( Río Indalecia , Río Guayo , Río Inabón , Río Blanco , Río Anón and Río Prieto ), and three that flow north ( Río Saliente , Río Toro Negro , and Río Matrullas ) from the forest. The Matrullas and Guineo reservoirs are also part of the forest. Río Toro Negro - after which the forest is named - separates the municipalities of Ciales and Orocovis; it also forms Lago El Guineo. The forest\\'s other lake, Lago Matrullas, is accessible via Puerto Rico Highway 564, which can be accessed via PR-143 , in the municipality of Orocovis.  \\n\nFlora\nToro Negro has four vegetation associations catalogued into two subtropical moist life zones: The first is a Subtropical Moist Zone (Zona Muy Húmeda Subtropical) and consists of the Tabonuco forest (Bosque de Tabonuco). The second is the Lower Mountain Wet Zone (Zona Muy Húmeda Montaña Abajo). This zone consists of three sub forests: the Micropholis Buchenavia forest (Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia), the Mountain Palm forest (Bosque de Palma de Sierra), and the Dwarf forest (Bosque Enano).  \\n\nE. L. Little and F. H. Wadsworth reported a total of 160 tree species distributed amongst 53 families.  The largest families are: Melastomaceae (16 species), Lauraceae (11 species) and Myrtaceae (10 species).  \\n\nFerns and orchids are abundant. Forty of the species found in this forest are endemic to Puerto Rico and thirteen are introduced species.  The fern Thelypteris inabonensis , endemic to this forest and found only at the headwaters of Rio Inabon and at the Toro Negro\\'s Cerro Rosa in Ciales, has been identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an endangered species.  \\n\nSome of the more common trees are: tabonuco ( Dacryodes excelsa ), ausubo ( Manilkara bidentata ), jagüilla ( Magnolia portoricensis ), nuez moscada ( Ocotea moschata ), granadillo ( Buchenavia capitata ), maga ( Montezuma speciosissima ), higüerillo ( Vitex divaricata ), almedrón ( Prunus occidentalis ) and jácana ( Pouteria multiflora ).  In addition Palmas de sierra ( Prestoea montana ) and helechos arbóreos ( Cyathea Sp.) are very abundant. Some of the species that were introduced to this forest are mahoe ( Hibiscus elatus Sw.), caoba hondureña ( Swietenia macrophylla ), pino hondureño ( Pinus caribaea ), eucalipto ( Eucalyptus robusta ) and kadam ( Anthocephalus chinensis ).  \\n\nIlex cookii , commonly known as Cook\\'s Holly or te, is a small evergreen holly shrub  known to exist only in the Toro Negro State Forest and only in extremely limited amounts.  It is listed as a critically endangered species by the IUCN and protected by law.  \\n\nBetween 1935 and 1943,  28 species of trees were planted in Toro Negro. Their plantings (either via seeding or via planting of saplings) consisted of both native and exotic species.  Nineteen native species were planted as follows (the quantity planted/seeded is shown after the species; and X means experimental planting only):\\n\nThe nine exotic species were:\\n\nFauna\nThere are 30 species of birds reported, including 6 endemic species and two that are endangered: the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk (Vernacular Spanish: Falcón de sierra ; Taxonomy: Accipiter striatus venator ) and Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk (Vernacular Spanish: Guaragüao de bosque ; Taxonomy: Buteo platypterus brunnescens ).  The Puerto Rican parrot (Vernacular Spanish: Cotorra puertorriqueña ; Taxonomy: Amazona vittata ), a critically endangered species, has also been seen in this forest.  \\n\nRecent studies have identified eight species of bats . They are most visible at dusk as this is when these nocturnal critters are out foraging for food, primarily mosquitoes. The 13 species of bats living in the forest play an important ecological role in controlling mosquitoes, which not only carry diseases but also harass hikers. The three most prevalent bat species are the greater bulldog bat , Antillean ghost-faced bat and the sooty mustached bat .  \\n\nThere are 20 species of reptiles and amphibians and, with the exception of Bufo marinus , all are endemic. Reptiles include the Lagarto verde [ note 2 ] ( Anolis cuvieri ), lagartijo pigmeo ( Anolis occultus ), and boa de Puerto Rico ( Chilabothrus inornatus ), which is in danger of extinction; amphibians include the siguana ( Ameiva exsul ) and the culebra ciega ( Amphisbaena caeca ). Amphibians include coquí común ( Eleutherodactylus coqui ) and the coquí de la montaña ( Eleutherodactylus portoricensis ), a species denominated as vulnerable under Puerto Rico Law 6766.  The Small Asian mongoose (Vernacular Spanish: Mangosta pequeña asiática ; Taxonomy: Herpestes javanicus ), has also been spotted inhabiting this forest.  \\n\nToro Negro State Forest is home to 11 species of snakes, all non-venomous to humans. The Puerto Rican boa ( Chilabothrus inornatus ) grows to 6-7 feet (1.8-2.1 m) in length and weighs about 2 pounds (0.91 kg). It is a heavy-bodied snake with tan to dark brown body color and dark blotches down its back. It will defend itself with a bite, but kills its prey by suffocation. It is a protected species due to over-harvesting to collect oil and skins. It is nocturnal and prefers to remain under cover during the day and hunt at night. The Puerto Rican racer ( Culebra Corredora ;  Alsophis portoricensis  ) grows to 3 feet (0.91 m). It slinks around in the trees of the Toro Negro Forest. His body sports a solid brown color with each of his scales edged by a darker brown. Like the forest\\'s other various garden snakes, it is a daytime hunter. The forest also features blind snakes . They spend nearly their entire lives underground but do sometimes take cover under rotting trees. They do not bite as they do not have teeth.  \\n\nIts rivers and lakes are home to several species of fish and crustaceans .  Fish found here include Dajao (Vernacular English: Mountain Mullet ; Taxonomy: Agonostomus monticola ) and Olivo ( Sicydium plumieri ), also known as Ceti . Some crustaceans are the camarón bocu ( Macrobrachium crenulatum ), gata ( Atya lanipes ), and buruquena ( Epilobocera sinuatifrons ), all endemic to Puerto Rico.  \\n\nFacilities\nWith the exception of the Salto de Doña Juana waterfall, all of the forest facilities, including all trails, are located within the municipality of Orocovis  and they are collectively known as the Doña Juana Recreational Area .  Guided tours are available or visitors explore on their own. Ziplining is also a common activity in the Toro Negro forest.  The forest office, staffed by personnel from the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources , provides maps of the forest and its trails and services, weather conditions information, and mud slides danger levels.  Among the facilities available at Toro Negro are a camping area, a recreational area, a system of hiking trails and observation points.  \\n\nOfficially there are 10 hiking trails covering 18 kilometers (11 mi). They are provided for hiking as well as to facilitate bird and landscape watching, meditation, and similar activities.  While the official number of trails is stated as 10, some of the trails are actually dirt roads for park ranger vehicles. Also, some of the \"trails\" require the hiker to walk a segment on a paved Commonwealth road or county road. Trails are generally quite wide, but being a forest in mountains with high humidity and rain precipitation, many of the trails are muddy in at least some areas.  Hikers are often seen with walking sticks , which help maintain balance when walking on slippery surfaces, particularly the algae-covered ground rocks present on some of the trails.  Some of the trails lead to or run near charcos . Charcos are natural swimming pools (swimming holes).  The Toro Negro State Forest office is the starting point for several of the trails. However, most of the trails are not well marked, nor are they well kept, so they can be hard to locate and to follow in the dense forest.  Under an agreement with the government of Puerto Rico, the municipality of Orocovis is the entity responsible for trail maintenance.  The 10 official trails are:\\n\nKey to icons:\\n - Indicates a Hiking trail area\\n - Indicates Camping area\\n - Indicates a Picnic area\\n - Indicates Diving or Snorkeling area\\n - Indicates Fishing area\\n - Indicates Swimming area\\n - Indicates a Lookout tower\\n - Indicates Visitors\\' Center\\n\nNamed Camino El Bolo , it is the forest\\'s longest trail, about 2 miles (3.2 km) long, and essentially a loop around Cerro El Bolo . This trail has its course along Cerro El Bolo (El Bolo Mountain), Puerto Rico\\'s tenth tallest peak at 3,527 feet (1,075 m) above sea level.  It is a low challenge trail. It is essentially a loop that starts at the visitors\\' parking area on PR-143 and terminates on PR-143 about 1/4 mile north of the visitors\\' parking area, from where hikers simply walk the road back to the parking area. Starting off at the visitors\\' parking area, hikers cross PR-143 to head south on the trail. This section of the forest has many banana trees and flowers along its way and starts off with a steep uphill climb. Approximately 0.4 miles (0.64 km) into the trail, the trail starts to head East and flattens out as it becomes a rocky at first and then grassy further on. Another 0.4 miles (0.64 km) heading East the trail connects to Trail #6 which leads to the swimming pool. Continuing East another 0.2 miles (0.32 km), the trail becomes uphill again as it connects to the northernmost point of a paved road, Puerto Rico Highway 561, on the right hand side. From this point on the trail starts to head North on a downhill grade but in less than 0.1 miles (0.16 km) it connects to Trail #3 which leads to the Observation Tower, where there is a sign that reads La Torre (\"The Tower\"). The trail continuous downhill North-Northwest about 0.8 miles (1.3 km) until it reaches paved road PR-143, in the vicinity of km 32.6. From this point hikers make a left to walk southwest bound on PR-143 (that is, \"West\" on PR-143) until reaching the visitors\\' area at km 32.4.  \\n\nThis trail leads to the Observation Tower. This trail if for advanced hikers. Trail #3 does not start at the visitors\\' parking area, so hikers must first hike on other trails to get to Trail #3.  Starting from the visitors\\' parking area, there are three ways to get to Trail #3. Path Option 1: This is the shortest route. Hikers get on PR-143, walking northeast bound (that is, making a left from the parking area to head \"East\" on PR-143) about 0.25 miles, make a right into the forest at the sign (\" Verada #6 - Piscina \") to get on Trail #6, hike the 0.8 mile of Trail #6 to its end, make a left into Trail #1 and hike about 0.3 mile to the beginning of Trail #3. Path Option 2: This is the second shortest route. Hikers take Trail #1 as described above under section \"Trail #1\" until they reach Trail #3 where there is a sign that reads \"Observation Tower\".  Path Option 3: This is the longest route. Hikers head northeast bound (that is, \"East\" on PR-143) passed the sign stating \"Trail #6 - La Piscina (this will be about 0.25 mile hike), and continue northeast bound for approximately another 0.25 mile until the sign stating \"Trail #1 - Camino Bolo where hikers make a right into the forest and continue this trail about 0.9 mile until coming to Trail #3.  \\n\nOnce on Trail #3, hikers climb this trail about 0.6 miles to its top where the observation tower is located.  The trail to the observation tower lookout hill is not for the faint of heart. It is very steep and very slippery. It is a one-way trail (in the sense that the same trail is used in the return trip) and the trail feels even more slippery in the downhill return hike. This trail is made of rocks but, because of the high humidity and low traffic, algae have overtaken the rocks to make the trail very slippery. Walking around the rocks does not always help as the area is muddy - though albeit less slippery. The view and fresh air and breeze make the trek quite rewarding. The views are unobstructed and panoramic 360° views are possible. The tower is 3,537 feet above sea level. Altogether the distance from the visitors\\' parking area to the tower is 2.14 miles.  \\n\nTrail #5 is about 0.9 mile long and is a medium challenge trail. There is a significant amount of mud on this trail, but less so in the dry season months of December through March and June through July. To reach this trail from the visitors\\' parking area hikers must first head northbound to trek the entire length of Trail #7 (the Camping Area trail, 0.1 mile long), cross the bridge over the Doña Juana Creek and then hop on Trail #8. From this point on Trail #8, hikers head West for about 0.2 mile where Trail #5 begins; its entrance is located on the right hand side. The trail heads North and leads to Puerto Rico Highway 564. The first segment of the trail runs downhill for 0.9 mile.  The trail runs a thick tropical jungle of banana trees, sierra palms, tree ferns, flamboyant trees , and elephant ears . The trail is muddy, steep, and scantily-marked. Visibility is minimal through the dense foliage.  There are several creeks near this trail and birds are abundant: black-throated blue warblers , northern parulas , green mangos , Cape May warblers , belted kingfishers , among others. After the 0.9 mile trek, the trail reaches PR-564. There is water pumping station on the left. From this point the \"trail\" turns right, as PR-564 is intended to be part of the trail. Hikers walk South on PR-564 for 0.6 mile where the northern terminus of Trail #9 (the Doña Petra trail) is located to the right. Continuing southbound on PR-564 for another 0.1 mile, the road trail meets PR-143, where hikers turn right to continue South on Trail #5. From this point hikers walk another 0.25 mile to arrive at the visitors\\' parking area on the right side of the road. Considering the hikes on Trails #7 and #8 plus the hikes on roads PR-564 and PR-143, Trail #5 is 2.95 miles long, making it the second longest hike of all of Toro Negro\\'s trails.  \\n\nThis trail is about 0.5 miles long and a low challenge trail. The trail is well maintained, but the natural pool that it leads to is open during summer months only. Starting from the visitors\\' parking area, hikers get on PR-143 walking northeast bound (that is, making a left from the parking area to head \"East\" on PR-143) about 0.25 miles, then make a right into the forest at the sign (\" Verada #6 - Piscina \") to get on Trail #6. This trail runs along a river for about 1/4 mile before it comes to the sign \"Piscina\" pointing left. Continuing south on the trail, there are two eye-catching waterfalls visible from the trail. Continuing southbound and uphill, the trail goes through two flat and open areas with picnic tables. After this, the trail continues uphill and southbound for about 0.6 miles where it comes to its end, reaching Trail #1. Once at Trail #1, hikers either make a left or a right to get onto Trail #1 (trail #1 is a loop trail) or, of course, may turn around to return to the parking area via Trail #6. The entire length of Trail #6 is 0.8 miles.  \\n\nThis trail is actually a paved forest road leading to the Los Viveros camping area, Toro Negro State Forest\\'s only campground . It is located north of the parking area.  The \"trail\" is only 0.1 mile long, wide and flat, thus a low challenge trail. The trail is also the connecting trail to Trail #8, which leads to Charco La Confesora (see below). Another use of this trail is that it leads to one of the forest\\'s three official picnic areas. Its picnic area is the one closes to the visitors\\' parking area. The Doña Juana Creek runs next to the picnic area.  \\n\nThis trail is 0.54 mile long, it is a medium challenge trail, and leads to El Charco (\"The Pond\"), a natural swimming hole. It is located north of the parking area, and starts at the end of Trail #7. After hiking north from the parking area on Trail #7 (Trail #7 is a 0.1 mile long paved road), and hiking by the camping area, Trail #7 comes to an end at the Doña Juana Creek . There is a sign pointing West ( Charco Confesora ) near the picnic area next to the camping area that serves as a landmark. At this point hikers walk over a little bridge to cross the creek, where Trail #8 begins. The trail heads northwest along the creek (the creek is located to the left of the trail) and the trail is abundant with wild flowers. It is a downhill trail and a bit muddy. A section of the trail consists of concrete steps. At the end of the trail is Charco La Confesora, a natural \"pool\", with a waterfall as a backdrop. swimming is allowed at this charco . The return path is the same as the path to the charco as the trail terminates at the charco .  \\n\nThis trail is 0.4 mile long, it is a medium challenge trail. Like Trail #5, it is located north of the parking area, and starts where Trail #7 end. Also, like trail #5, there is a significant amount of mud on this trail, though less so during the dry season months of December through March and June through July. To reach this trail from the visitors\\' parking area hikers must first head northbound to trek the entire length of Trail #7 (the Camping Area trail, 0.1 mile long) and cross the bridge over the Doña Juana Creek. Trail #9 begins at this bridge. Heading to the left from the bridge is the path for Trail #8, but heading straight up (northbound) gets hikers onto Trail #9, the Doña Petra Trail. (Like trail #5, the \" Las Cuarenta \" trail, Trail #9 will also bring the hiker to State Route PR-564, but being a shorter trail, it does not encounter PR-564 as far north as Trail #5 does.) The first segment of the trail runs downhill for 0.2 mile, where according to ranger office maps, there used to be a trail to the left (i.e., westbound) leading to Trail #5. However, vegetation apparently overran such connecting trail because it is no longer visible. The trail then continues another 0.2 mile where it reaches PR-564. From this point the \"trail\" turns right, as PR-564 is intended to be part of the trail. Hikers walk South on PR-564 for 0.1 mile where the \"road trail\" meets PR-143. At State Route PR-143 hikers turn right to continue South on Trail #9. From this point hikers walk another 0.25 mile to arrive at the visitors\\' parking area on the right side of the road. Considering the hikes on Trail #7 and roads PR-564 and PR-143, Trail #9 is 0.75 mile long.  \\n\nTrails #2, #4 and #10 are no longer active trails. Trail #2 was called Camino Ortolaza and was 0.5 mile long. It was a \"one-way\" trail (i.e., same entrance and exit) and ran from PR-143 to the Doña Juana Creek. It started on PR-143 some 0.25 mile west of the entrance to the Area Recreativa/visitors\\' parking area and headed North ending at the Doña Juana Creek, about 0.2 mile west of Charco La Confesora . Trail #4 was called Camino Vega Grande and was 0.4 mile long. It was another \"one-way\" trail and began on PR-143 about 0.1 mile east of the current Trail #1 eastern terminus. Trail #10 was called Camino El Tabonuco and was about 0.2 mile long. It was also a \"one-way\" trail. It originated at km 32.3 on PR-143 and headed north into the forest.   \\n\nAn unnamed trail, but referenced and marked in the DRNA maps, is a trail that could be termed Trail #11 for referential purposes. It was located midway on Trail #9 (that is, about 0.2 mile west of PR-546) and headed north to Trail #5. It met Trail #9 at a point about 0.2 mile west of PR-546. This trail was about 0.3 mile long. It served the double purpose of acting as a nature trail while at the same time it connected Trails 5 and 9, thus making for a shortcut from Trail #5 back to the car parking area via Trail #9. DRNA considers this unnamed trail a part of (an offshoot of) Trail #5.  \\n\nThe campgrounds (camping area) at Toro Negro is called Los Viveros .  It is located on PR-143, Km 32.5.  Its coordinates are at 18.17502°N, 66.49202°W ( 18°10\\xe2\\x80\\xb230.0714\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°29\\xe2\\x80\\xb231.2714\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.175019833°N 66.492019833°W ﻿ / 18.175019833; -66.492019833 ). Camping is available for a maximum of 35 people.  Camping facilities include restrooms and showers.  A permit is required for camping and they are purchased in advance, as there are no permit sales on premises.  In the proximity of the campgrounds there is also a picnic area. It has six picnic shelters with covered BBQ , on-site water, and a spot for a campfire.  \\n\nLake El Guineo and Lake Matrullas are both man-made reservoirs. Fishing, boating and kayaking is allowed at the El Guineo and Matrullas reservoirs.  Lake El Guineo is located at 18.1579°N 66.5284°W ( 18°9\\xe2\\x80\\xb228.44\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°31\\xe2\\x80\\xb242.24\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.1579000°N 66.5284000°W ﻿ / 18.1579000; -66.5284000 ), at an altitude of 3,002 feet above sea level.

The lowest temperatures recorded on the Puerto Rico\\xe2\\x80\\x94some 40 °F (4 °C) -- were measured at Lake Guineo.  Lake Matrullas is located at 18.2064°N 66.4798°W ( 18°12\\xe2\\x80\\xb223.0394\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°28\\xe2\\x80\\xb247.2794\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.206399833°N 66.479799833°W ﻿ / 18.206399833; -66.479799833 ), at an altitude of 2,464 feet above sea level.  It too is between the municipalities of Ciales and Orocovis. It is located northeast of the Doña Juana Recreation Area, on PR-564 at km 6.1.  The Puerto Rico DRNA allows the use of kayaks in Lake Matrullas. The ambiance is cool and misty. Both lakes are all well stocked with Peacock and Largemouth bass .  Creeks are abundant in the area, and in addition to the Quebrada Doña Juana, the forest also has a number of other creeks, such as Quebrada Rosa.  \\n\nThe observation tower, accessible only on foot via Trail #3, rises at 3,537 feet above sea level, making it the highest manmade point on the island.  The observation tower sits atop Cerro Doña Juana , Puerto Rico\\'s 11th highest peak at 3,474 feet (1,059 m) above sea level.  The tower\\'s coordinates are 18.17178°N, 66.48091°W ( 18°10\\xe2\\x80\\xb218.4074\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°28\\xe2\\x80\\xb251.2754\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.171779833°N 66.480909833°W ﻿ / 18.171779833; -66.480909833 ).  The tower is used for observation of the landscape surrounding Toro Negro and, on clear mornings before the afternoon clouds roll in, both the northern and southern shores of Puerto Rico are visible. San Juan is also visible as a distant haze in the northeastern horizon.  The observation tower affords views Lake El Guineo and Lake Guayabal as well as the Caribbean Sea.  It was built by the Spaniards during colonial times as a lookout tower to protect the south coast of the Island.  [ unreliable source? ] \\n\nCharcos are natural ponds, or swimming holes, formed by the mountain rivers as they fall as waterfalls onto the ground below. They are popular way of refreshing from the summer heat in the Toro Negro State Forest. The forest\\'s \"official\" pool is accessed via Trail number 6, the La Piscina (\"The Pool\") trail. To reach trail 6, hikers start out from the forest office/parking area and hike north on route PR-143 about 1/4 mile. Trail 6 is located on the right hand side of the road. This pool is a river-fed pool. It became deteriorated, in disrepair and closed to public use sometime prior to 2010 and, in February 2013, there were unconfirmed reports that it had been repaired and reopen. In 2008, it was reported that an agreement between DNRA and the local community had been signed whereby the community would help repair the pool.  Under an agreement with the government of Puerto Rico, the municipality of Orocovis is the entity responsible for pool maintenance.  In any case, this pool opens only during the summer months. The pool\\'s water temperature is very chilled, but refreshing, given the high humidity of the area, particularly in the afternoons.  La Piscina is located at 18.1713°N 66.4876°W ( 18°10\\xe2\\x80\\xb216.52\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°29\\xe2\\x80\\xb215.53\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.1712556°N 66.4876472°W ﻿ / 18.1712556; -66.4876472 ).\\n\nA second river-fed swimming pool charco is located at Charco La Confesora . It is about 15 x 25 feet large and deep enough to dive feet first.  This charco is accessed via Trail number 8, located at the end of Trail 7, the trail to the camping area.  The pool at Charco La Confesora is located at 18.176901, -66.495861. ( 18°10\\xe2\\x80\\xb236.8436\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°29\\xe2\\x80\\xb245.0996\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.176901000°N 66.495861000°W ﻿ / 18.176901000; -66.495861000 ).\\n\nThe forest includes Puerto Rico\\'s highest peak, Cerro de Punta , which is located at km. 17.0 on Puerto Rico Highway 143.  It is at 18.1722°N, 66.5917°W ( 18°10\\xe2\\x80\\xb219.8\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°35\\xe2\\x80\\xb230.03\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.172167°N 66.5916750°W ﻿ / 18.172167; -66.5916750 ). The mountain is the dividing landmark for the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya. The mountain is accessible by car but the road is quite steep and many prefer to walk the road (it is about half hour\\'s hike to the top) unless riding on an all-wheel drive vehicle.  There is parking on PR-143 for those who prefer to walk to the hilltop.  Another peak in the Toro Negro is Cerro Maravilla , infamous due to the murders of two independentistas youth at the hand of police in an ambush. This peak is also accessible by car from PR-143. The road leading to the top of Cerro Maravilla is PR-577 and is not as steep as that to Cerro de Punta (the Cerro de Punta road has no state signing.) This road is also much shorter, about 0.5 kilometer total length. Cerro Maravilla is located at 18.1532°N, 66.5543°W ( 18°9\\xe2\\x80\\xb211.6\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°33\\xe2\\x80\\xb215.56\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.153222°N 66.5543222°W ﻿ / 18.153222; -66.5543222 ).  Communications towers for radio, television, cellular and similar systems are located atop each of these peaks and armed security personnel, including police, is on the premises. However, private individuals can access both of these peaks.  Overall, the Forest contains Cerro Punta,  Cerro Rosa and Cerro Jayuya ,  which are considered to be Puerto Rico\\'s three highest peaks.  Cerro Maravilla , Cerro El Bolo , and Cerro Doña Juana are also located within the Toro Negro Forest.\\n\nNearby attractions\nThese falls  are about 200 feet tall. They are not located within the Toro Negro State Forest itself but they are near it, requiring visitors to drive 3.9 km westbound on route PR-143 from the Doña Juana Recreational Area to reach PR-149, then drive an additional 2.3 kilometers northbound on PR-149 (towards Ciales). The falls are on PR-149 at km 41.3.    They are the tallest waterfalls in Puerto Rico.  Their coordinates are 18.182836, -66.512257. ( 18°10\\xe2\\x80\\xb258.2096\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°30\\xe2\\x80\\xb244.1252\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.182836000°N 66.512257000°W ﻿ / 18.182836000; -66.512257000 ).\\n\nThe falls are part of the Doña Juana Creek as it runs into Rio Toro Negro at the line that divides the municipalities of Ciales and Orocovis. The falls are very accessible, as they are viewable from the road as drivers cross the bridge of these falls. The falls fall next to the road on its eastern side and then run under the PR-149 bridge, to feed into Rio Toro Negro located a few yards on the western side of PR-149.\\n\nThis lookout position (known in Spanish as the Mirador Villalba-Orocovis or the Villalba-Orocovis Lookout) is located outside the Toro Negro State Forest but still on PR-143 (km 39.8  ) and a short distance from the forest, and it is a popular stop over for visitors to the forest. It contains picnic areas, restroom facilities and various trails.  It is located at 18°10\\'37\"N, 66°27\\'0\"W,  that is, 7.4 kilometers east of Toro Negro State Forest\\'s Doña Juana Recreational Area.  \\n\nClimate\nThe Toro Negro State Forest is located in the cool, moist mountains of the Cordillera Central. Mean annual temperature from 19.4 to 25 °C.  Temperatures are unmistakably cooler at higher elevations.  Average yearly temperature is 18.4 °C (65.12 °F).   \\n\nAverage annual precipitation of five weather stations in and surrounding the forest ranges from 203 to 292 cm.  As much as 150 inches of annual rainfall has registered at Toro Negro.  The average annual rainfall is 110 inches. The months of September and May experience the most precipitation. A dry season runs from December through March. The months of June and July also tend to be dry.  \\n\nGallery of flora and fauna\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links"

It contains about 708 million gallons of water. The reserve was designated in 1979 through a program of Coastal Zone Management PR. It is located between the municipalities of Vega Baja and Manatí . It covers approximately 2.43 km 2 (0.94 sq mi).  \\n\nIt is divided into two main parts: in the east and northeast, the Laguna Grande (\"Big Lagoon\" in English), and in the south, the Laguna Rica. A swamp located northeast of the pond, El Cabo Caribe (\"Cape Caribbean\" in English), includes one of the most important areas of the reserve as a source of nesting and feeding waterflow ecosystem.\\n\nGenerally, Tortuguero is made up of swamps, marshes, soils of silica sand and hills. Although not a forest, its variety of rare endemic plants and flowers has earned it a place amongst the most important reserves in Puerto Rico, just after El Yunque , Toro Negro State Forest and the Forest of Maricao .\\n\nNative, exotic and endemic species in the reserve\nNative species:\\n\nEndemic species:\\n\nExotic species:\\n\nFlora\nThe flora of this reserve is the fourth most important in Puerto Rico. There are 717 species of plants.\\n- 144 are rare and endangered\\n- 56 live in fine white sands around the lagoon\\n- 110 live in organic soils of swamps\\n- 37 species are native to America\\n\nAll of the above are found exclusively on the Tortuguero Lagoon. There are seven species of insectivorous plants in the area of the lagoon. Two of these are in danger of extinction, which are Drosera capillaris and Utricularia subulata clesitogama . The rest is divided into:\\n- 265 are indicators of wetlands\\n- 132 tree species\\n- 79 species of sedges\\n- 78 herbs\\n- 38 species of ferns\\n\nThe extremely rare tree Schoepfia arenaria was found to grow in the reserve in 1990. Less than 200 of these Puerto Rican endemic trees are known to exist.  \\n\nFauna\nThe reserve provides an environment conducive to bird diversity. There have been 83 species of birds identified across the reserve. Of these, 30 are migratory and the rest are resident in Puerto Rico. Among the residents are the Puerto Rican spindalis , Puerto Rican oriole and Adelaide\\'s warbler . In aquatic ecosystems, birds such as ruddy duck and Caribbean coot and are generally abundant. As for fish, they are generally abundant but small. The lagoon is a shelter and breeding ground for females fish. There are 23 species of fish in the lagoon, among the native are eels , tarpon , snook and mackerel bigeye. Among those introduced are the black seabream, bass and tilapia. It also emphasizes the presence of oviparous fish such as the \"guppy\" of the genus Poecilia .\\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nTrain of the South\nThe Train of the South \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or Tren del Sur in Spanish \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is a historic 1,000 mm ( 3 ft 3 + 3 ⁄ 8 in ) narrow gauge heritage railroad operating within the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico in Arroyo .   It was formed in 1984 to preserve the last surviving sugar cane plantation line still in existence on the entire island, which was part of a large railroad system that operated around Puerto Rico prior to the 1950s.   \\n\nOverview\nThe railroad took passengers and sightseers across Arroyo\\'s old sugar cane fields on a fifty-minute long guided tour that explained the industry and other historic aspects of it.   Most of the original railroad right-of-way is former Ponce & Guayama trackage, which was in regular use up until 1990;  a short 4-mile (6.4 km) segment became the Tren del Sur in 1984.  Much of the original equipment abandoned on site also served as historic props along the route.\\n\nAfter a temporary shutdown in 1988, former Arroyo\\'s mayor Reinaldo Pirela obtained funds from Puerto Rico\\'s government to refit tracks and the transfer of eight Plymouth locomotives from Central Aguirre\\'s stock to restart successful operations in 1996. In 2005, the railroad was temporarily shutdown pending a major restoration project; although all work has been halted in recent years afterwards for unknown reasons.   However, the Department of the Interior has plans to re-commission the railroad and extend the system further sometime in the near future.     To enforce legal protection of the Tren del Sur, the Puerto Rico Legislative Branch first approved the Law 118-1995  and later the Law 212-2014 that superseded the 1995 law, but both laws failed to keep the train running.  \\n\nReinaldo Pirela\\'s successor, former Arroyo\\'s mayor Basilio Figueroa (term: 2003-2013), found the Tren del Sur operations too expensive for the Arroyo\\'s municipal budget. As a result of past unaccomplished promises of financial assistance from Puerto Rican Legislative and Executive Branches, mayor Figueroa signed a contract with Progressive Southern Railway Inc. (a local company just incorporated in 2005  ) to refurbish and manage the Tren del Sur. When Progressive Southern Railway took control of the Tren del Sur assets in November 2005 under the premise that the \"rails needed to be refitted\", they dismantled nearly all of the tracks along the 4-mile (6.4 km) route to \"send to the United States for refurbishment\"; after this, the historical train never resumed operations. Progressive Southern Railway Inc. sued the Arroyo Municipality for remaking a complement of accords, because the Land Authority of Puerto Rico never transferred property of right-of-way to the Municipal Government of Arroyo, asking for $2.5 million in compensation. In 2011, the Arroyo Municipality realized that the lawsuit costs were too expensive, and settled paying $100,000 to Progressive Southern Railway Inc.  \\n  \\n\nRolling stock\nA number of vintage and historic rolling stock equipment exists around the grounds of the Train of the South. Locomotives that once operated the tourist trains until 2005 consist of original plantation-era Plymouth Locomotive Works diesel switcher engines which range from five 18-ton engines to three 40-ton locomotives.  The 40-ton Plymouth\\'s are all painted in a direct mirror of the old Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway red and silver Warbonnet scheme, including the yellow Santa Fe \"cigar band\" logo with the railroad\\'s name painted within it. Engine #18 was the main locomotive used on all tourist runs, it pulled several converted flatcars with custom built interiors to allow for seating of passengers. Along the route, many of the sidings are filled with abandoned sugar cane related freight cars.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n17°58\\xe2\\x80\\xb234\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°03\\xe2\\x80\\xb246\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 17.97599°N 66.06280°W ﻿ / 17.97599; -66.06280 \\n"

The custom house is located at the site of the former main port of the city of San Juan, north of the former Spanish Arsenal of San Juan , and next to the Las Dársenas and Immigrants\\' Square ( Plaza del Inmigrante ) and the Jose V. Toledo Federal Building and United States Courthouse . The large two-storey custom house is considered by the NRHP to be a superb example of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. It is most notable for its size, its elaborate terracotta-ornamented central tower and its pink-colored exterior.  \\n\nHistory\nThe custom house was designed by architect and Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury inspector Albert B. Nichols , who also designed the custom houses of Fajardo and Ponce . It was built between 1924 and 1931 at the site of a smaller 18th-century custom house, at a critical location that used to function as the central business district of San Juan during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the site of the main port of Puerto Rico (today the main cruise ship port section of Old San Juan) before the construction of the new port ( Puerto Nuevo ) located along the southern edge of the Bay of San Juan .  The Colonial Revival design was chosen to preserve the Spanish Colonial character of the area, as it incorporates architectural elements of the former Spanish custom house but also many of the Renaissance and Neo-Gothic elements popular in Spanish architecture of the time.  The former Spanish custom house, which also housed a smaller warehouse and post office, was demolished at an unknown date during the first decade of the 20th century. This was done as a territory-wide project to enlarge and upgrade the governmental properties in Puerto Rico during the early 20th century. Construction was made by the Philadelphia -based Richmond and Kemp Ornamental Iron and Bronze and by the North American Wood Products Company of New York City . It was primarily used as a custom and additionally as a warehouse by the American Customs Service in Puerto Rico until the end of World War I . Additional modifications were made in 1957 and 1959 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while air conditioning was installed by 1960.  The building is still owned and managed by the U.S. Customs Service.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

The poured-concrete building is significant architecturally and historically for the role it played in the first, transitional phase of the American customs service in Puerto Rico, from 1898 through 1931. This period is bracketed on one end by the cession, on December 10, 1898, of the island of Puerto Rico to the United States by Spain as a condition of the Treaty of Paris ending the Spanish-American War , and on the other by the completion in 1931 of the major building and rehabilitation program undertaken by the U.S. Customs Service following World War I .  \\n\nHistorical background\nWhile the Fajardo Custom House is the least imposing of the customhouses included in this multiple-resource nomination, it is still more impressive than those at Arecibo, Arroyo and Aguadilla, which were constructed during the same period but are no longer owned by the United States Customs Service. Its amplified Spanish Colonial-Revival style is in keeping with the somber economic import of its construction date, and the building provides a feeling of permanence and dignity in a minimally developed area. It was designed by Albert B. Nichols , architect and building inspector, Puerto Rico Field Office of the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. Ten sheets of drawings of the Fajardo construction signed by Nichols (out of a total of twelve sheets) are in the San Juan Custom House files.  \\n\nFajardo was in use as a port of entry at the end of the Spanish era and through much of the  early American period. A small plain customhouse of the Spanish period is known to have exited here.\\n\nBuilding description\nThe United States Custom house in Fajardo\\'s Puerto Real was built in 1930 on a waterfront site which was originally directly on the beach, without a street. Today, the first and second floor of the building are used by the U.S. Custom Service and part of the first floor by the U.S. Postal Service.  Part of the second floor is believed to have formerly been the residence for the customs port director, although the architect\\'s drawings indicate only office use.\\n\nThe customhouse is a 2 1/2-story, rectangular-plan, poured-concrete and concrete-frame structure with a rear one-story-with-roof-terrace wing, also of concrete. The main portion of the building is 33\\'0\" by 49\\'0\" and the rear wing is 16\\'6\" by 49\\'0\". The waterside east elevation is three bays wide with an original entrance door in the northernmost bay. Each first-floor bay on the east and north elevations has a large round-arch opening. As part of the extensive alterations of 1975, the other two east elevation arches have been, blocked in \\nexcept for small central windows and the corner opening last brick in the arch.\\n\nThe two openings on the north left and center retain their original doors and decorative iron and griHework and Terra-cotta. The right-hand opening to the post office is a plain arch opening replacing the original rolled-steel door.\\n\nThere is a terra-cotta string course with four crests between the floors on the east side. On the second floor of the east side, the end bays have modern paired windows and the center bay has one paired and one single metal window of 1975. There are three gabled dormers each with copper louvers instead of windows. The roof is covered with red Spanish tile. The south side windows have been replaced by glass blocks while the original double board door remains in the center. The north and present front elevation on Calle Union is a gable end and is three bays wide on the first floor, two bays upstairs. Above the filled-in attic fan window, on either end is a standard for a flagpole.\\n\nThe  building is in generally sound condition  but with significant alterations made in 1975. There has been some modification of the original plan on both floors which has caused elimination of some of the architectural elements and the incorporation of new materials and techniques with no historical relationship to the building\\'s original appearance. These changes include the installation of wall mounted air-conditioners and acoustical-tile suspended ceilings, removal of decorative ironwork, blocking of openings, and replacement of original metal casement windows with modern metal windows. The second-floor east windows were originally steel casement-awning sash, with four sets in the center flanked by pairs at the sides. The south side had two pairs of windows and the north side was single windows. The casement windows are two eight-light casement sash topped with two four-light awning windows.\\n\nThe first-floor plan of the building is based on the division of the space by a wall that runs the length of the building north to south and divides the space into two approximately 15\\' wide rectangles that are then subdivided by partitions, creating small rooms and offices.\\n\nAt the northeast corner of the building is the entrance lobby principal public space of the original building. Approximately 15\\' \\xc3\\x97 10*8\", it contains a simple, single-turn staircase to the second floor along the west side and features a masonry rail. The southern wall contains an ornamented cashier\\'s window and door, all with wrought-iron decorative grilles. The door provides entrance to the general office behind. The floor is quarry tile. The general office, approximately 15 x 22 feet, has a suspended acoustical-tile ceiling, as does the next and last room on this side, the port director\\'s office. The western half of the customhouse contains storage and warehouse area, except for the northwest corner, which is partitioned for the U.S. Post Office, Puerto Real branch of Fajardo, located in what was originally warehouse space.\\n\nThere is a small L-shaped lobby and two customer windows. The second floor is devoted to general working area and offices, along with a kitchen, bathroom and the roof terrace over the rear wing. A portion is believed to have been originally used as the Port Director\\'s residence, as noted. Portions of the terrace have now been closed in or roofed. On the exterior, the first floor windows and doors on the north and east elevations are placed in large, slightly recessed arched openings, creating an arcade along the base of the building. \\nOnly the three doors on the north elevation have wood-paneled double doors. Only the original east entrance door, the present north entrance door and the north center door retain their original decorative glazed tiles in the lintels over the door. Only the north left and north center doors retain the decorative iron grille-work in the arch. The north center door has also retained its original ornamental ironwork gate in front of the wooden door. Between the second floor windows on the north side there is a large Terra-cotta U.S. \\nCustoms Service crest. On the east elevation the words, \"U.S. Custom House,\" are located in masonry letters above the first-floor windows. On the interior, the lobby retains its original, ceiling, quarry-tile floor, and steps with polished-concrete treads. The original ornamental iron grille survives in the upper panel of the door to the general office and the cashier\\'s window beside it.\\n\nThe other floors are covered with vinyl tile, and the ceilings are obscured by suspended acoustical 2x4 tile. On the second floor there are a few places where the original gypsum ceiling and simple cornice moldings are still visible. There is a ladder and scuttle opening to the attic, which is unusable space filled with roof trusses and concrete framing. The rear of the building is plain. The first floor initially had small, fixed, steel sash, now closed in. On the second floor, opening to the original porch, are five doors and three windows from the original plan. There is a 1975 iron fence around the north and east sides of the building, and a masonry wall is on the south lot line. There were originally decorative posts and gate at the south side of the building.\\n\nTen of the twelve architect\\'s drawings for this building, by Albert B. Nichols,  Architect  and Inspector of Buildings, survive in the files of the San Juan Customs House.\\n\nToday\nThe United States Customs House in Fajardo, Puerto Rico still in active status under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection . Its mission is to enforce various provisions of the customs and navigations law. This building is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places since February 12, 1988, and it was added to the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.  The U.S. Postal Service Puerto Real branch moved to another location near the custom house at Calle Union in Fajardo.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nUnited States Customs House (Ponce, Puerto Rico)\n\\n\nThe U.S. Customs House , located at Bonaire and Aduana streets in barrio La Playa , Ponce, Puerto Rico , is the oldest customs house in Puerto Rico ,  and the only one of its type under the U.S. flag. As of 10 February 1988, the building was owned by the U.S. Customs Service , Washington, D.C.  The building is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as \"U.S. Custom House\".  It was listed on 10 February 1988 and later on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2001.  \\n\nHistorical background\nThe Ponce Customs House opened in 1842.  At that time, customs administrative offices and warehouses were located on the first floor, while the second floor was devoted to dwelling units for the director of the customhouse and for the captain of the Port of Ponce . In 1845 the customhouse survived a terrible fire that destroyed most of the Ponce port vicinity.  During the Spanish-American occupation, In 1898 General Nelson A. Miles established the headquarters of the American army in the customhouse during the Spanish-American War , from which he directed the invasion of the southern part of Puerto Rico. Salvador Brau, noted Puerto Rican historian, served as the head appraiser for the Spanish customs service in Ponce; after the American occupation, he was appointed by General Miles as Customs Administrator of Puerto Rico, a post he held for many years.  \\n\nDuring the period of significance, Ponce was the second most populous city in Puerto Rico, with a population of about 70,000, and for most of the period, the second busiest port, after San Juan.  \\n\nFollowing a major earthquake in 1918 , the U.S. Customs Service undertook a comprehensive program of rebuilding and new construction. The remodeling may have been under the supervision of Albert B. Nichols, architect and inspector of buildings under the Supervising Architect of the Treasury\\'s San Juan field office. A sheet of drawings, unsigned and undated, for the remodeling are in the San Juan Custom House files, and the Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office believes that they may be Nichols\\'  work. Three other sheets signed by Rafael Carmoega , Chief architect of the insular government and presumed to date from August 1930, exist in the Public Building Service records.  \\n\nThe Ponce Custom House was designated a historic customhouse by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1972.  Despite its 1924 remodeling, it remains an important example of Spanish Colonial architecture outside Old San Juan .\\n\nBuilding Description\nThe building is a Spanish-period building which was remodeled by the United States in 1924, with small changes since then. The two-story building has massive masonry walls and large arched entrances to a central courtyard that reflects its Spanish origins, while the false partial gables with Spanish barrel tiles are typical of the United States Spanish Revival architectural work of the 1920s. The building is situated on the waterfront facing the Caribbean Sea and next to the port of Ponce, two miles from the center of this second-largest city in Puerto Rico. The customs house fully occupies a small city block. Its principal facade faces Bonaire Street and looks toward the ocean across a grassed area containing a Coast Guard beacon. It is located in an area of traditional warehouses, commercial buildings, mostly one-story and many from the Spanish period. There is a sidewalk around the four sides of the building, with the one on Bonaire Street wider and providing three mature trees.  \\n\nThe building is a simple rectangle measuring 97 feet wide x 83 feet deep. The plan is typical of Spanish construction, with interconnected rooms, around the outside perimeter that also open to a central courtyard . There is a wide arched vehicular passage leading from the front through the courtyard to the rear exit from the building. The original courtyard has been partially closed in on the first floor only on each side of the passageway to create two additional rooms. Between the front rooms and the courtyard, a fine masonry staircase rises on the left side off the central passage. The second floor repeats the first-floor layout of perimeter rooms with later modifications, but includes the full extent of the original courtyard or patio in the center. Originally there may have been a roofed courtyard gallery for circulation around the courtyard. At present, there are two short modern gallery sections bridging between the quarry-tile-paved roofs of the infilled first-floor courtyard areas. At the head of the stairs is a large public lobby that opens to the courtyard and to the front of the building. There is also a small circular iron stair to the roof from the southeast corner of the second-floor courtyard.  \\n\nThe facades are similar with regular door and window openings and with small balconies to the second-floor openings. There is a small partial false gable roof of Spanish barrel red-clay tiles around the four sides and around the courtyard. On the front (south) facade, facing the ocean, there are five bays with a large elliptical arch-headed passageway large enough for vehicular traffic. It is architecturally marked only by a plain, flat frame painted differently from the body of the building. There are plain board, double doors with a smaller pedestrian port in the right door. In the elliptical arch there is a simple fanlight window. Flanking the arched entrance are two large high windows on each side. The windows are two-leaf casements with exterior solid and Jouvered combination paneled shutters. Metal grilles are at each window. The walls have a simple low projecting base course, and the first floor walls are marked by horizontal incised coursing, all in stucco . There is a large molded string course between stories and on the second floor, five door openings, each with double-leaf doors that are half sash, which replaced the original louvered and paneled shutter combinations. Over the doors are sashed transoms, although the right group has been replaced by air conditioners . Each opening has a decorative wrought iron balcony with scroll support dating from the U.S. remodeling of the building. Previous to these wrought-iron balconies, the building had cast iron railings. \"U.S. Customs\" is lettered over the central window. At the top is a large double masonry molded cornice, surmounted by the small false partial gable in Spanish tiles, both from 1924. On the front only, there are three flag poles on the roof, and a large antenna system. On each side of the first floor passage entry is an alarm box and a plain light fixture.  \\n\nThe rear facade is identical to the front, except that the right first-floor opening is a plain board door rather than a window and that some of the second-floor doors still retain their original louvered and paneled shutter systems and have not had glass inserted.  \\n\nThe side facades are similar to the front and rear, except for the absence of the arched passageway. Both sides are in five bays, all windows, on the first floor, with the exception of a door on the east side. The second-floor openings and balconies match the front with air conditioners generally mounted in the transoms. On the west side one second-floor door has a modern boxed-out bar grille around it.  \\n\nConstruction of the original 1841-42 building is in traditional heavy masonry walls two feet thick.  The ceilings are high: 15\\' on the first floor, 14\\' on the second. There are several large structural arch openings in the interior masonry walls. The exposed floor joists are heavy 4x10 beaded edge ausubo wood members laid 24\" on center. These old joists support modern concrete slab second floor laid over wire mesh and composition board forms laid during the 20th century remodeling. Also added at this point was reinforced concrete framing adjoining the old walls on the first floor. It is now in deteriorated condition, while the original walls appear generally sound.  \\n\nIn the interior, the central passage extends from front to rear through the open courtyard, paved in quarry tiles. On the left side at the front of the building, are two Immigration and Naturalization Service offices. On the right front are two U.S. Department of Agriculture offices. Behind the offices on the left side of the passage is a fine enclosed stair with two runs and a landing. The remaining first-floor rooms are storage rooms and a shop with concrete floors, several 8\\' wide masonry openings with slat fanlights (sol truncos). Storage room windows are solid vertical board shutters without sash and with outside metal grilles. Two rooms flanking the passage in the center fill in an original part of the courtyard in a manner similar to the older construction.  \\n\nOn the second floor, the staircase from the entry passage opens on a large lobby from a two-arched staircase arcade. The lobby extends from the front back to the courtyard and is floored with diagonally laid gray and white marble tiles. The walls, as are old walls in the building, are plastered, and the ceiling has exposed 4x10 beaded ausubo wood beams. Old double four-paneled doors and a transom open to the courtyard. The window in the stairhall has been filled in with glass brick.  \\n\nThe offices on the second floor generally have been modernized with acoustical tile ceilings, fluorescent fixtures and vinyl floors. The old exterior doors remain, generally with glass replacing the shuttered sections, except for several windows on the rear lavatories and kitchen. Air conditioners are mounted in the transoms over the doors. On the southeast corner is a large inspector\\'s office, with a counter for public business. Some old masonry partitions had been removed or altered to create this space. Along the east side, small rooms have been partitioned off and in the rear northeast corner is the large Port Director\\'s office, in its original configuration. Across the north rear are a men\\'s lavatory, a women\\'s lavatory and a kitchen, all with black and white floor tiles. The kitchen appears to be original to the building and has traces of the original masonry cooking stove and flue . The left rear north corner room now used for training is also floored in old black and white tiles.  \\n\nIn the San Juan customs house files, there is one large sheet of remodeling plans for the Ponce Customs house, possibly by Albert B. Nichols, although not signed. In 1985 Customs Service commissioned a set of fifteen measured drawings by architect Rene Acosta, Hato Rey, P. R. which are reproduced in a report by the architect on the rehabilitation needs of the Ponce Custom House. (Feasibility Study for the Rehabilitation of the U.S. Ponce Custom House, Ponce, P. R.)  \\n\nSignificance\nThis United States Custom House in Ponce is the oldest extant customhouse in Puerto Rico. Built in 1841-42, the adobe building of the Spanish era was remodeled by the United States in 1924. It is historically and architecturally significant for its antiquity and its importance in the Spanish period of customs administration in Puerto Rico, as it is the only one of its type among U.S. Customs Service properties. It is also significant for the role it played in the transitional phase of the American customs service in Puerto Rico, from 1898 to 1930. This period is bracketed at one end by the cession on 10 December 1898 of the island of Puerto Rico to the United States by Spain and on the other end by the completion in 1930 of the major building and rehabilitation program undertaken by the U.S. Customs Service following World War I. The Ponce Custom House is an important example of the Spanish-Colonial architecture outside of Old San Juan .  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nResources"

        "page_content": "Contents\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\\n\n\\n\nThe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico (in case citations , D.P.R. ; Spanish : Tribunal del Distrito de Puerto Rico ) is the federal district court whose jurisdiction comprises the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . The court is based in San Juan .  The main building is the Clemente Ruiz Nazario United States Courthouse located in the Hato Rey district of San Juan. The magistrate judges are located in the adjacent Federico Degetau Federal Building, and several senior district judges hold court at the Jose V. Toledo Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Old San Juan . The old courthouse also houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court . Most appeals from this court are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit , which is headquartered in Boston but hears appeals at the Old San Juan courthouse for two sessions each year. Patent claims as well as claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act are appealed to the Federal Circuit .\\n\nThe current United States attorney is W. Stephen Muldrow .\\n\nScope and relevance\nThe United States first established a federal court in Puerto Rico under the Foraker Act of 1900. This court was a territorial court , operating within what the Supreme Court would soon define in the Insular Cases as an unincorporated territory of the United States . As such, the court was established under Article IV rather than Article III of the United States Constitution . The Supreme Court of the United States discussed the nature of the court in Balzac v. Porto Rico , 258 U.S. 298 (1922). Because the court was a territorial court rather than a full-fledged District Court, its judges did not enjoy Article III protections such as life tenure .\\n\nThe District Court in Puerto Rico continued to be an Article IV court even after Puerto Rico attained its commonwealth status . However, in 1966, the U.S. Congress conferred life tenure on the federal judges of Puerto Rico, transforming the court into a full-fledged Article III district court with the same status as the other United States District Courts throughout the country.  The congressional report on the bill making this change described the change of status as being \"appropriate in light of the court\\'s caseload and the conferral of Commonwealth status on Puerto Rico,\" and also explained:\\n\nSee 1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2786-90; see also Examining Bd. of Engineers Architects and Surveyors v. Flores de Otero , 426 U.S. 572, 595 n.26 (1976) (\"The reason given for this [law] was that the Federal District Court in Puerto Rico \\'is in its jurisdiction, powers, and responsibilities the same as the U.S. district courts in the (several) states\\'.\"). This important change in the federal judicial structure of the island was implemented not as a request of the Commonwealth government, but rather at the repeated request of the Judicial Conference of the United States. See Senate Report No. 1504, 1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2786-90.\\n\nNo similar law has been passed for the three insular territories that still have Article IV status, though there have been calls from time to time that these judges also deserve the protection of life tenure. [ citation needed ] \\n\nCurrent judges\nAs of January 2, 2024 [update] :\\n\nFormer judges\nChief judges\nChief judges have administrative responsibilities with respect to their district court. Unlike the Supreme Court, where one justice is specifically nominated to be chief, the office of chief judge rotates among the district court judges. To be chief, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge. \\n\nA vacancy is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years, or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position.\\n\nWhen the office was created in 1948, the chief judge was the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire, on what has since 1958 been known as senior status , or declined to serve as chief judge. After August 6, 1959, judges could not become or remain chief after turning 70 years old. The current rules have been in operation since October 1, 1982.\\n\nSuccession of seats\n\\n\n\\n\nArticle IV judges\nJudges who served on the Court from 1900 to 1966, before it became an Article III court, were:\\n\nDuring this period, judges for the District of Puerto Rico were appointed by the president for 4-year terms until 1938, and thereafter for 8-year terms. The court statutorily comprised a single judge until 1961, when a second judgeship was authorized by Congress, although the position was not actually filled until 1965. Until the 1950s, when the District Court judgeship was vacant, when the judge was away from Puerto Rico, or when the court\\'s docket became overly backlogged, sitting judges of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico were designated to act as judges of the federal court.\\n\nJudge Ruiz-Nazario, appointed by President Harry Truman in 1952, was the first Puerto Rican to serve as a judge of Puerto Rico\\'s federal court.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nUniversidad del Sagrado Corazón\nUniversidad del Sagrado Corazón (English: University of the Sacred Heart ), abbreviated \"USC\" and often called simply Sagrado , is a private Catholic university in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico . It is one of the oldest and largest educational institutions in Puerto Rico with origins dating back to the 1880 establishment of an elementary school by the Society of the Sacred Heart .\\n\nThe university is situated in an area which was urbanized in the first decades of the twentieth century with great residences that belonged to the privileged families of the time and is rich in architectural styles. Renowned architect Antonín Nechodoma located his residence in Monteflores and some residences designed by him are still in the area. Including buildings with the unique French-style neoclassic architectural characteristics of the residence of Pablo Ubarri, Count of Santurce, which is now the center of the university\\'s main campus. Such buildings abound along with Puerto Rican adaptations of Victorian architecture. There are also homes in the \"tropical\" U.S. influenced Mission Revival , French-gothic, Spanish Colonial Revival , Prairie School , and several apartment structures of the \" Art Deco \" periods in Bouret street.  \\n\nHistory\nIt was the year 1880 when three nuns of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus landed on the docks of San Juan, coming from Havana, Cuba.  Their mission was to establish in Puerto Rico the educational and spiritual work that just 80 years before Mother Madeleine Sophie Barat had begun in France.\\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the institution acquired the Count of Santurce Estate and established the foundations of what makes-up today\\'s campus.\\n\nIn 1935, the local government issued the Letter Foundation, whereby it established the College of the Sacred Heart. Four years later, in 1939, the institution granted its first academic degrees. The original founding purpose was as an educational center for women in Puerto Rico to achieve ample knowledge, not only for their personal enrichment, but for the benefit of the territory.\\n\nIn 1970, the religious order opted to transfer ownership and governance of the institution to the Board of Trustees (composed of some religious, but mostly lay members). This transition allowed for the notable expansion of academic offerings and student body.\\n\nIn February 1972, a change in the institution\\'s original vision took place. The Board of Trustees approved the establishment of an entirely co-ed institution. In December 1976, the Board of Trustees authorized the use of the new official name: \"Universidad del Sagrado Corazon\" (USC) or University of the Sacred Heart (USH). In 1985 , the university established the first three graduate programs in: Education, Communications, and Business Administration.\\n\n\\nIn October 1984, Pope John Paul II held a mass at the university during the first and only Papal visit to Puerto Rico. \nIn 1990, the university began to limit the number of undergraduate students accepted, in order to raise academic standards.\\n\nIn January 2019, the division of continuing education was rebranded Sagrado Global , the School of Professional Studies at Sagrado, and started offering professional certificates in Digital marketing, Data Analytics, and Graphic Design, among others.  These professional certificates, some of which are also offered remotely, require taking 6 courses and can be completed in 1 year or less.\\n\nIn 2019, the university had its first School of Music graduates with seven obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in music.  \\nIn 2019, Socorro Juliá- one of the oldest faces of the university was interviewed by El Vocero. She stated that she has been affiliated with the university since she was 5 years old, long before her religious calling.  \\n\nIn 2019, the university joined forced with the Santurce Cultural Center in an initiative to help business owners by offering free business  workshops and help local business explore ways to grow their business.  \\n\nCampus\nThe campus of the University of the Sacred Heart is composed of 33 acres (130,000 m 2 ) of undulating terrain and shading, from whose height can see \\npanoramic views of the ocean and surrounding urban areas. In its abundant vegetation, highlighting forest of tropical plants that contribute to the freshness and beauty of the land University.\\n\nFor the development of its activities, the university has the following facilities: the broad main building architecture classical, lifted at the beginning of the twentieth century, which today accommodates the administrative offices and in whose center is home to the Chapel of the Institution, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983,  the residence of the Religious of the Sacred Heart, the Information and Resource Center Modern facilities of the library. Then followed the student Residences, modern style, and south of the earlier, a complex structure consisting of classrooms, administrative and faculty offices, and an amphitheater.\\n\nThe Mother Maria Teresa Guevara Library, one of the vital units of the university for his significant educational role, offers services to teachers, students, administrators and other members of the university community.\\n\nThe Emilio S.

        "page_content": "Contents\nUniversity Gardens High School\n\\n\nUniversity Gardens High School , formally University Gardens Community School Specialized in Science and Mathematics , is a secondary magnet school located in Hato Rey Sur , San Juan, Puerto Rico . University Gardens is run by the Puerto Rico Department of Education and is overseen by its Specialized Schools Unit (UnEE, for its initials in Spanish).  \\n\nUniversity Gardens is known for its high standards, its \"hard work\" culture coming into the national culture.  Recognized for featuring some of the highest standardized test scores in Puerto Rico, it has been criticized for having 27.8% of its student population come from living below the poverty line .  \\n\nHistory\nSince at least 1972 a high and middle school already existed in the gated eponymous community,  located in the Río Piedras district.  The University Gardens neighborhood is located right along PR-52 , and close to the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras campus . It has historically been composed mostly of middle class and upper lower class families, and serves as \"serves as a buffering zone between the rich and lower class areas of San Juan\". Currently, there has been an influx of upper class individuals, who have transformed some residence into mansions.  In 1976, it was converted into a magnet school.\\n\nRoxánna I. Duntley-Matos described the school\\'s appearance as it was in 1981 as:\\n\n[having] a one level concrete building with modern aluminum-lined see-through glass doors. It gleamed of science\\xe2\\x80\\x94air conditioned science\\xe2\\x80\\x94surrounded by tropical concrete benches in the front patio, embraced by what seemed to be a square wired fence. Youth, dressed in yellow polos and dark blue pants, strolled around the yard discussing each other\\'s romantic adventures, the latest movies, the upcoming parties or school special events, the homework they had failed to complete or tests they would soon have to face.\nIt used to offer grades 10th-12th,  however this was changed by a Department of Education reorganization.\\n\nAfter the 2019-20 Puerto Rico earthquakes UGHS was evaluated and, while the field inspector declared the school \"suitable for immediate operation and occupancy,\" they did note that there were fissures on the walls, as well as the fa\\xc3 7ade of a wall that was close to breakings off.  \\n\nDuring February 2021, it was one of 172 public schools identified as \"suitable to open\" that formed part of an initial phase proposed by the Department to resume in-person teaching starting in March.   Nevertheless, this plan was abandoned, and in-person classes did not occur until 13 May.  \\n\nOn the first day of class seniors came in a caravan on the first day of school, as part of their traditional celebration for the beginning of their final school year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic , from August 2021 onwards, classes will start at 8:00 a.m. and end at 1:00 p.m., after students receive their take-out only lunch.  \\n\nSchool community\nAccreditation is obtained from the Puerto Rico Education Council for six years. However, in 2014, it was approved, but not accredited, by the Council.  \\n\nUniversity Gardens is part of the Puerto Rico Department of Education\\'s Specialized Schools Unit (UnEE, for its initials in Spanish),  which at times has been under the Assistant Secretary for Academic Services,  Educational Transformation Projects,  Curriculum and Pedagogical Innovation Division,  and the Undersecretariat for Academic and Program Affairs.  In 1990, University Gardens was classified as an \"Effective School\", as instruction was based on Ronald Edmonds\\' model .  \\n\nBeing what is considered a five star school by the Department of Education, it receives less funds than those given to underperforming school, which receive more money for teachers\\' professional development.  Recognized for featuring some of the highest standardized test scores in Puerto Rico, it has been criticized for having 27.8% of its student population come from living below the poverty line , as of 2018,  down from 32.3% in the 1997-1998 school year, when it counted with a 758 total student population.  \\n\nIn 2018, six students from UGHS were selected to partake in the National Grid Engineering Pipeline Program in Syracuse , sponsored by National Grid , providing them with an all-expenses paid trip to visit the Fruit Belt Neighborhood Solar Partnership, the Niagara Power Project and Syracuse University .  \\n\nThe Department of Education tends to use the school to interview applicants for posts at other schools.  The school library was one of the first three public high school libraries to be chosen to participate in the Puerto Rico Librarian\\'s Society\\'s Puerto Rican Library Information and Documentation Network (PRILINET) in 1979.  \\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n18°24\\xe2\\x80\\xb220\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°03\\xe2\\x80\\xb257\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.4056°N 66.0659°W ﻿ / 18.4056; -66.0659 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nUniversity of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus\nThe University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus  is a public land-grant research university  in San Juan, Puerto Rico . It is the largest campus in the University of Puerto Rico system in terms of student population and it was Puerto Rico\\'s first public university campus.  \\n\nThe university serves more than 18,000 students, 20% of whom are graduate students, and grants an average of over 3,000 degrees a year. Its academic offerings range from the bachelor to the doctoral level with 70 undergraduate programs and 19 graduate degrees including 71 specializations in the basic disciplines and professional fields.  UPR\\xe2\\x80\\x90RP has consistently granted the largest number of doctorate degrees to Hispanic students under the United States jurisdiction.\\n\nHistory\nIn the year 1900 the Escuela Normal Industrial ( Normal Industrial School) was established in Fajardo, Puerto Rico , as the first institution of higher education in Puerto Rico dedicated to train those who would become teachers and educators.  At the time it only had 20 students and 5 professors.  \\n\nA year later (1901) the institution was moved to an area previously occupied by farmland immediately north of the town of Río Piedras , today part of the municipality of San Juan . The Normal School was established in La Convalecencia , which was one of the residences of the former Spanish Governors . The school enrolled 273 students on its first year, and its first bachelor\\'s degrees were granted four years later in 1907.  \\n\nOn March 12, 1903, under the administration of the Public Instruction Commissioner, Samuel McCune Lindsay, the 2nd Legislative Assembly approved a law creating the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras, transferring all the funding of the Insular Normal School there. This school became the first department of the university, what is now the Faculty of Education, becoming the nucleus of the University of Puerto Rico.\\n\nNow legally established, the University of Puerto Rico started its first academic year (1903-1904) with an enrollment of 173 students. Due to the scarcity of teachers in the island, most of these students were appointed by the Department of Public Instruction to teach at schools without having finished four years of college. [ citation needed ] The first graduating class (June 1907) consisted of 13 students.\\n\nIn 1907, the first class graduated from the normal course of four years after the university was legally established. Among the students in that class were Carlota Matienzo , Isabel Andréu, Loaíza Cordero , Marina Roviro, and Juan Herrero.\\n\nOn September 22, 1913, the departments of Law and Pharmacology were established. The university at the time required only an eighth grade diploma, but with the expansion of its courses, this requirement changed. After 1917, the departments of Normal Education, Liberal Arts, Pharmacology, and Law required a high school diploma for admission.\\n\nOn February 21, 1931, Dr. Carlos E. Chardón was appointed as chancellor of the university. During his tenure the university experienced significant growth in endowments. These were used in the expansion of the physical facilities at the Río Piedras and Mayagüez Campuses. This helped turn the university into a respected educational center. Chardón resigned from the post of Chancellor in 1936, being succeeded by Juan B. Soto. The most important part of this period was the expansion of the buildings of the university as part of a plan for the rehabilitation of Puerto Rico.\\n\nThe university was the site of social upheaval during the 1960s and 1970s, when nationalist students protested for civil rights , against the war in Vietnam , for the independence of Puerto Rico , and to expel the ROTC from the campus. In 1970 Antonia Martínez was murdered by the police during the anti-education reform and Vietnam War protests of that year. As the shouting started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de León Avenue , went to the balconies to see what was happening. She was, like many others, watching the events, saw policemen attacking at the students, and allegedly shouted at the police \\xc2 1Asesinos! (Assassins!). A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate. A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel covered it with paint. Other stories claim that she was shot by mistake.  The students of the university also had a strike in the Spring of 2017 during which the school was shut down for several months.\\n\nCampus and academic facilities\nThe Río Piedras Campus is located in the northern end of the downtown area of Río Piedras , a former town but now a district ( barrio ) of San Juan, Puerto Rico . The campus is easily accessible via public transportation by means of the Tren Urbano metro system with a station ( Universidad ) located in campus, and the public bus system of San Juan ( AMA ). The campus is home to a rich diversity in architecture and urban planning with old and modern buildings that showcase the architectural development of the past 120 years in Puerto Rican architecture .  \\n\nIn 1936, architect Rafael Carmoega , working under the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA), designed the distinctive University of Puerto Rico clock tower based on the 1924 Parsons Plan.  The iconic university clock tower was built in 1937 and christened as the Franklin Delano Roosevelt tower, in honor of the president and his interest in the building of the university. La Torre (as The Tower is nicknamed in Spanish) is located at the entrance of the Román Baldorioty de Castro Building.  Right below the tower there is a monument to the nations of the Americas portraying the coats of arms of all American states within a bronze circle, as a symbol of the Panamerican Union .  Under the supervision of architect Rafael Carmoega , a group of local architects designed what is known as El Cuadrángulo ( The Quadrangle ), a plaza-like quadrangle.  The campus\\'s central quadrangle and tower were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\\n\nThe University of Puerto Rico was established in Río Piedras in 1903. The first buildings were the Normal School (1902), the Model School (1903), and the Principal\\'s Residence (1903), next to the Central Road (today Ponce de Leon Avenue ). Over the years, the development of the university occurred somewhat spontaneously. In 1908 the architectural firm of Clark, Howe and Homer designed a new fa\\xc3 7ade for the Model School in the California Mission Style . In 1909 a milk processing building was constructed in an agricultural area, east of the academic center. Arts and Crafts\\' Workshop buildings, a Library and a Gymnasium were planned, as well as the grandstand and the fence (all demolished now). In 1912 construction began for the Memorial Hall (Baldorioty Building) and buildings for the Law School and the School of Pharmacy were in the works in 1918. In 1924 the Chicago firm of urbanists Bennett , Parsons and Frost were contacted to design a master plan for the future development of the university.  It was not until 1935, with the establishment of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA) and the large sum of federal funds that it invested for public works in Puerto Rico, that the partial design and construction of the so-called Parson Plan began. However, from the 1940s onward a new architectural paradigm, which discarded historical vocabularies and incorporated attitudes learned from Germany and from the studio of Frank Lloyd Wright , stemmed from German émigré Henry Klumb . For 20 years Klumb was sole architect for the University of Puerto Rico, designing buildings for the campuses at Río Piedras and Mayagüez until in 1966. At that time chancellor Jaime Benítez assigned the design of the General Studies Building to the architectural firm of Toro & Ferrer. Other buildings for the university have been designed by architects Antonio Marqués Carrión (sports facilities, 1971); José Firpi (student residence Torre Norte , 1971); the firm of Reed, Torres, Beauchamp & Marvel (new Education Faculty Building, 1974 and the first expansion to the Faculty of Natural Sciences Building, 1978); the firm of García & Landray (second expansion the Faculty of Natural Sciences Building, 1989); GDO Arquitectos (School of Architecture Building, 2001) and Toro Ferrer (new General Studies Building, 2007).\\n\nIn addition to La Torre and The Quagrangle, several buildings in the UPR-RP campus have been added to the National Register of Historic Places , such as the former female residence hall \" Residencia de Señoritas \" building which now houses administrative offices.  \\n\nThe university library serves the research and teaching needs of the university community. It also extends its services to the Puerto Rican community at large. The system comprises eighteen specialized and general libraries, with holdings totaling more than 4,000,000 items, [ citation needed ] access to which may be gained through the university\\'s online catalog [ where? ] . Of special interest [ to whom? ] are the Caribbean and Latin American Studies Library and the Puerto Rican Collection, both located in the José M. Lázaro Building .\\n\nIn addition to the traditional library services, such as reference, circulation, reserves, photocopying, local interlibrary loan, and the compilation of bibliographies and acquisition lists, the Library System also participates in on-line interlibrary loans with many libraries worldwide. Other services include Dial Order, DIALOG, microfilming, reproduction of photographs, library instruction and orientation, lectures, and exhibits. The Integration of the Information Competencies to the Curriculum Projects promotes the development of information competencies around the campus. The Library System offers facilities for the blind and physically handicapped. The graduate and special collections in the Business Administration, Planning, Public Administration, Social Work, and Library Science programs are integral parts of the Library System, but the libraries of the School of Law, Natural Sciences Faculty, and the School of Architecture, also located on the university campus, operate independently.\\n\nThe Information Systems Office serves the educational, research and administrative efforts of the institution. As a member of Internet2 and the Internet, the university enjoys instant communication with institutions all over the world for the purposes of correspondence and information access. Improvements to existing telecommunications infrastructure include the installation of structured cabling in campus buildings and fiber optics as a means of interconnecting them. Currently, campus buildings are configured to ATM (155Mbits / s) and Gigabit Ethernet interfacing equipment, providing greater capacity to transfer video, voice and data. The campus is capable of offering video conferencing over ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), or via the Internet in H.323 format.\\n\nThe Museum of Art, History, and Anthropology (MAHA) was created in 1951 by legislative act to \"complete and preserve our art, history, and anthropological heritage,\" as a means to educate and enrich our culture. The current building, designed by the architect Henry Klumb, was inaugurated in 1959. Since its establishment, the museum has actively contributed to the growth of Puerto Rican cultural life by holding art, historical, and anthropological exhibits and sponsoring lectures, seminars, publications, and workshops-to the benefit of both the academic and the general communities.  \\n\nThe Río Piedras campus provides housing in three residence halls:\\n\nThere is also a Guest House within the Student Center , with rooms at affordable rates for visitors to the university, faculty, or students.\\n\n10% of first-year and 4% of all undergraduates live in college housing. No married student housing is available. Also, private housing is available in surrounding areas of the university.  \\n\nOrganization\nThe Río Piedras Campus is a collegiate university . The Chancellor of the Campus is the top academic and administrative officer and presides over its two deliberative bodies: the Administrative Board and the Academic Senate.\\n\nThe Administrative Board , composed of the deans, two senators representing the faculty, and one student senator, advises the Chancellor in matters pertaining to the university program. The Board makes recommendations on leaves and faculty aid applications, and grants promotions and tenures.\\n\nThe Academic Senate , in turn, is the official academic forum. It is composed of the deans, the director of the library system, elected faculty representatives from all the colleges and schools, student senators, and representatives from the staff of academic advisors. Its members participate on the institutional processes, establishing academic rules and collaborating with other organisms of the University of Puerto Rico system.\\n\nThe General Student Council ( Consejo General de Estudiantes or CGE in Spanish) of the UPRRP is the elected student government of the campus. The council is composed of several representatives to the student council, elected by each School or College, the number of representatives varies depending on the number of students enrolled in the School or College, and the President and Senator of each School and College, for a total of around 50 members. Elections are held in April and representatives are elected for one year, from July 1 to June 30.\\n\nHaving its origins in the 1920s, the Student Council was dissolved in 1948 while Jaime Benitez was chancellor, and under the council presidency of Juan Mari Brás and it was not until 1968 that the Student Council was re-installed under the name General Student Council and under the council presidency of David Noriega .  \\n\nThe General Student Council is governed by the Board of Directors, which is elected from among the council\\'s members and is composed of:\\n\nAdditionally, they select Representatives to the Campus\\' Administrative Board and the university\\'s University Board, both of them with an Alternate Representative. They are members of the board of directors.\\n\nEvery College and School has a student council of its own, composed by a President, Vice President, Executive Secretary, Treasurer, Records Clerk, Public Relations Chair, the college or School\\'s Student Senator (and, if available for the college/school, an alternate senator), Representatives to the General Student Council (up to four), and representatives of each department or subdivision present in the School or College.\\n\nColleges have a dean, an associate dean, assistant deans, department chairs, and other administrative directors. In August 2019, the president-elect of the College of Business Administration Student Council, Alberto J. Lebrón, established the university\\'s first independent college board, founding the UPRRP College of Business Administration Directive Board, composed of two representatives from each of the college\\'s associations and student council directives, with Lebrón serving as the board\\'s first chairman. Each college also has several committees established; examples being the school or college\\'s advisors committee, the curriculum committee, and the accreditation committee.\\n\nThe campus (and each school/college) has three administrative divisions known as a \\'Deanery\\' or \\'Dean\\'s Office\\'. These include:\\n\nAcademic Affairs (DAA in Spanish, Decanato de Asuntos Académicos ) promotes academic excellence, giving guidance and orientation for successful planning with the Campus Strategic Plan. It implants academic policies, and looks for the effective improvement of all personnel. It promotes and designs institutional research and coordinates accreditation processes. It evaluates the programs offered at the university, while trying to improve institutional effectiveness.\\n\nIt is responsible for the suitable development of the services in the Libraries, Registrar, Admissions, and Continuing Education. It advises the Rector and the adequate units, such as the Administrative Council and the Academic Senate on the development of new politics, and efficacy of processes, planification, and academic decisions.\\n\nIt is organized with a dean heading it, with the help of the Associate Dean and 3 Auxiliary Deans, each assigned a certain area of concern such as Foreign Students, General Studies, Business Faculty, the Library System, etcetera.\\n\nThree schools are under the Dean of Academic Affairs. These include the School of Communication, the Graduate School of Planning and the Graduate School of Informatic Sciences and Technologies and they are represented on the Administrative Board by the Dean of Academic Affairs.  \\n\nThe Deanery of Students is the leader organization, compromised with an ever-changing academic population. They try to bring the most advanced technological resources in order to be of help with respect to the services given to students.\\n\nFaculties included are:\\n\nThe Deanery of Administration is the unit that offers essential services to the university community: it implements and guards for the proper fulfillment of the regulations that rule over administrative processes of the Campus and the entire University System. It plans, coordinates, evaluates and supervises labors related with different administrative and operative processes, but over all, they ensure quality services that have a positive aspect on student life, teaching and learning scenarios, investigation areas, labor areas of conformities, according to the Campus mission and the Public Administration that commands the university.  \\n\nAcademics\nThe Campus serves more than 18,000 students, 20% graduate, and grants an average of over 3,000 degrees a year. From 2005 up to 2010 doctorate degrees conferred have maintained an upward trend. UPR\\xe2\\x80\\x90RP has consistently granted the largest number of doctorate degrees to Hispanics in the US.\\n\nAs a public comprehensive doctoral institution, its\\nacademic offerings range from the baccalaureate to the doctoral degree, through 70\\nundergraduate programs and 19 graduate degrees with 71 specializations in the basic\\ndisciplines and professional fields.\\n\nThe graduate offer includes 12 PhDs, one Doctorate\\nin Education, and international programs in Law, at both LLM and JD levels. The Campus\\nfrontier of knowledge production has been expanded during this period with the creation of a\\nMaster in Cultural Management and Administration in the College of Humanities, and Masters\\nand PhD programs in Environmental Science, the PhD currently under consideration by the\\nlicensing board in PR, to be initiated in August, 2010. 56 academic programs are\\nprofessionally accredited.\\n\nThe university is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities - High research activity\".  It supports research centers and institutes including the Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies that conducts long term environmental research on Caribbean islands and similar tropical areas and is part of a global research network, and the Institute of Caribbean Studies (est. 1958)  (which publishes the journal Caribbean Studies , ISSN 0008-6533 )  and the Institute of Psychological Research , among others.  \\n\nSchools and colleges\nThe School of Architecture of the University of Puerto Rico offers a Bachelor of Environmental Design and a Master of Architecture . The Master of Architecture professional degree is offered by the School, accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).  \\nThe UPR School of Architecture was established thanks to legislation approved in Puerto Rico in 1958 for such purpose.

UPRM is the second-largest university campus of the University of Puerto Rico system. In addition to its status as a land-grant university, it is also a member of the sea-grant and space-grant research consortia. In 2009, the campus population was composed of 12,108 students, 1,924 regular staff members, and 1,037 members of the education staff.  In 2013, the student population remained relatively steady at 11,838, but the instructional faculty dropped to 684.  In the second semester of 2019 around 12,166 students were enrolled.  By the end of the academic year 2022-2023 there were 10,071 students enrolled.  UPRM has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since 1946.\\n\nHistory\nThe University of Puerto Rico was created by an act of the Legislative Assembly on March 12, 1903, emerging as an outgrowth of the Normal School, which had been established three years earlier to train teachers for the Puerto Rican school system. In 1908, the benefits of the Morill-Nelson Act declared applicable to the island, fostered the rapid growth of the university. Evidence of that growth was the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts at Río Piedras in 1910 and the College of Agriculture at Mayagüez in 1911 as a land-grant university .  \\n\nThe founding of the institution is credited to D.W. May (Director of the Federal Experiment Station), José de Diego and Carmelo Alemar.  In 1912 the name of the institution was changed to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts or Colegio de Agricultura y Artes Mecánicas (CAAM).  \\n\nIn 1918, an earthquake and a fire caused significant damage to the institution. The ruins of the entrance of one of the buildings, Degetau Hall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which not only withstood the earthquake, but proved to be almost indestructible after the rebuilt hall was torn down in the late 1950s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would later become the emblem of the institution. In 1988, the archway (the portico ) was rebuilt, landscaped and turned into a monument.   \\n\nThe campus rectory was located at the José de Diego building , the oldest standing edification within the campus, built in 1911. The building was inscribed in the National Historic Building Registry as an architectural patrimony. In 1940, a clock tower was built into the main building. In 1993, the building underwent a restoration.  \\n\nIn 1929, the Liga Atlética Interuniversitaria was created at the Mayagüez campus. The LAI is an athletic organization, similar to the NCAA , created with the purpose of promoting and regulating sports activities. It originally consisted of a three event competition: basketball, baseball and track and field. Currently the competition consists of more than 25 sports.\\n\nIn 1942 as a result of university reform, the campus was organized with a considerable degree of autonomy into the Colleges of Agriculture , Engineering , and Science under the direction of a vice-chancellor . In the 1950s the institution saw more programs added when the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Nuclear Center were established.\\n\nThe Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly reorganized the University of Puerto Rico\\'s system in 1966. This reorganization of the system lead to the controversial change of its name to University of Puerto Rico - Mayagüez Campus, which is used in the present day as the official name of the institution.  \\n\nIn 2007, 35.4% of all Engineering degrees were granted to women at UPRM, one of the largest percentages in US universities.  The University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez is the second largest Hispanic-serving institution in the United States.\\n\nIn 2010 the campus went on strike as part of the 2010-2011 University of Puerto Rico strikes . In 2017 in response to budget cuts to the university system by the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico the campus students voted to join the University of Puerto Rico strikes, 2017 .\\n\nOrganization\nUPRM consists of the Colleges of Agricultural Sciences , Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, Engineering , and the Division of Continuing Education and Professional Studies. The College of Agricultural Sciences includes the Agricultural Experiment Station.\\n\nThe Administrative board of the Mayagüez Campus consists of the chancellor as presiding officer, the deans , two academic senators elected among those faculty members of the senate who are not ex officio , senators, and an elected student representative. The president of the university serves as an ex officio member. The board acts as an advisory body to the chancellor, prepares the development plan of the campus, approves the proposed budget prepared by the chancellor, and grants tenure, promotions and leaves of absence.\\n\n\\xc2 7 Interim chancellor later made permanent\\n\nThe Academic Senate at UPRM is composed of the members of the administrative board, the director of the library, the director of the counseling office, representatives elected from the faculties whose total must not be less than twice the number of the elected ex officio members, an elected member of the Library and Counseling Office, and ten student representatives. The academic senate is the official forum of the academic community. Its main task is to participate in the formulation of academic processes within the university\\'s legal structure.\\n  \\n\nCampus\nThe UPR-Mayagüez campus encompasses approximately 315 acres (1.27 km2). The campus has a sports complex that includes a gym, a weight room, rooms for dance/aerobic classes, courts for basketball, a tennis and volleyball complex, a natatorium, an outdoor sports field and the Rafael A.

It\\'s the only medical school in the University of Puerto Rico System .  It is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). Its students are predominantly Puerto Rican residents. However, anyone is allowed to apply to this university. It is also considered the top bilingual medical school in the world due to its requirement for each admitted student to fully master both English and Spanish.\\n\nHistory\nIn the nineteenth century, major health problems affected the Puerto Rican population. Anemia, malnutrition and parasitism were some of the most common conditions in children and adults. With the arrival of U.S. troops in 1898, the need for effective health plans to serve the population became a priority. With the change of sovereignty, anemia commissions were established in Puerto Rico. Thus began the development of what would become the Institute of Tropical Medicine, which was formalized in 1912.\\n\nA consolidation of the former Institute of Tropical Medicine and other entities led in 1926 to the formation of the School of Tropical Medicine. Funds from Columbia University were used for the training of different health professionals in the island. At the same time, the school\\'s professors conducted studies in collaboration with Columbia University physicians on tropical diseases hitherto of unknown etiology, or of high prevalence morbidity and mortality in Puerto Rico. In 1946 following the end of World War II, Columbia University canceled the money sent to the Medical School, which led to its closure. The legislature authorized a School of Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico, into which the School of Tropical Medicine was integrated.\\n\nThe need for a State Medical School led in 1950 to the creation of the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine as part of the University of Puerto Rico System , thanks to efforts made by the lawyer and first president of the University, Jaime Benitez . It began with an enrollment of 52 students. The school received its accreditation on 20 April 1954. In 1960, the University established a graduate program, [ which? ] unique [ why? ] in Puerto Rico, along with other [ which? ] medical services and research.

        "page_content": "Contents\nUSS Killen\n\\n\nUSS Killen (DD-593) , was a Fletcher -class destroyer of the United States Navy .\\n\nNamesake\nEdward Killen joined the Navy on 5 May 1801 as a seaman aboard the schooner USS Enterprise . Accompanying her to the Mediterranean he was promoted to Master\\'s Mate on 9 November 1803. He volunteered for Lieutenant Stephen Decatur \\'s expedition into Tripoli Harbor on 16 February 1804 to destroy USS Philadelphia , a United States frigate captured by Tripolitan pirates in the First Barbary War . After successfully completing this mission on USS Intrepid , Killen served on board Enterprise until his death on 24 July 1806.\\n\nConstruction and commissioning\nKillen was launched on 10 January 1943, by the Puget Sound Navy Yard , Bremerton, Washington ; sponsored by Mrs. Inez Cowdrey; and commissioned on 4 May 1944.\\n\nWorld War II\nAfter shakedown Killen cleared Port Angeles, Wash. on 19 August 1944, escorted a convoy from Pearl Harbor and arrived at Manus , Admiralty Islands on 14 September. Following training exercises the destroyer departed Hollandia on 12 October with the Central Philippine Attack Force that arrived off San Pedro Bay on the 20th. For the next 5 days she gave day and night fire support to troops ashore on Leyte , and during one 30-minute period on the 21st silenced three enemy artillery positions. When the Japanese Navy decided to contest the landings in the Battle of Leyte Gulf , Killen 's squadron engaged the enemy at Surigao Strait . On the morning of 25 October, at 03:25, she launched five torpedoes toward battleship Yamashiro . One hit, slowing her to 5 knots (9.3 km/h), enabled other American destroyers to maneuver for the kill. In the widespread fleet actions for Leyte , covering hundreds of thousands of nautical miles, the U.S. Fleet reduced the Japanese Fleet to an ineffective force thus greatly speeding up the advance toward Japan and end of the war.\\n\nKillen resumed antiaircraft screen. While on patrol off Leyte on 1 November she was attacked by seven enemy aircraft. The destroyer splashed four raiders before a bomb from one of the attackers found its mark in Killen 's port side, killing 15. After temporary repairs at San Pedro Bay and Manus, she steamed into Hunter\\'s Point, Calif ., on 15 January 1945, for overhaul.\\n\nReturning to Manus on 9 May, the destroyer sailed the next day for convoy escort and patrol duty in the Philippines . Killen formed part of the screen for the cruiser USS Nashville carrying General Douglas MacArthur to nearly every island in the chain to give his \"I have returned\" speech.\\n\nLacking the propulsion system necessary to operate with the fast carriers around Okinawa , Killen was kept in the south with the cruiser fleet. She steamed into Brunei Bay , Borneo , on 10 June with the assault forces , and supported the troops with prelanding bombardment. She resumed exercises on 15 June before arriving off Balikpapan , Borneo, on 27 June for fire support missions. After silencing enemy shore batteries on Borneo, Killen prepared for the final phase of the Pacific war as she arrived Manila on 14 July. She cleared that port 2 weeks later, and joined the North Pacific Force in the Aleutian Islands .\\n\nUpon the cessation of hostilities the destroyer was assigned to the occupation forces in the Japanese islands. Departing Adak on 31 August, Killen took up station at Ominato in northern Honsh\\xc5 b , and supported the occupation forces until 14 November, when she sailed to Puget Sound . From there she proceeded to San Diego , arriving on 2 April, and decommissioning on 9 July 1946.\\n\nTarget ship\nThe veteran destroyer served as a target ship during the atom bomb tests in 1958 ( Operation Hardtack I , shots WAHOO and UMBRELLA),  and in 1962 engaged in high explosive tests in the Chesapeake Bay to assess the structural effects of the ship\\'s nuclear exposures. Killen was struck from the Navy List and sent to the US Naval Station at Roosevelt Roads , P.R. in January 1963 to be used as a target ship for missile and gunnery practice off the nearby Puerto Rican island of Vieques where she was eventually sunk/scuttled in a shallow bay in 1975 and still lies today.\\n\nStudies and site visits made in 1999 by a Puerto Rican marine archaeologist and the University of Georgia discovered nearly two hundred steel barrels of unknown origin and contents among the wreckage of the Killen . Based on government descriptions of the nuclear tests in the Pacific,  some scientists and Vieques environmental activists have been concerned that nuclear-fallout cleaning materials were likely stored inside those barrels and improperly disposed, possibly entering the local environment prior to sinking or exposing contaminants to the animals and habitat of Bahia Salina del Sur in Vieques after sinking.\\n\nIn 2003-2004, a Virginia-based company called Underwater Ordnance Recovery (UOR), in cooperation with the University of Georgia, was contracted by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\\'s Justice Department to again study the ex-Killen wreck.  Nothing unexpected was found. In conclusion, the barrels were probably just used for ballast & buoyancy during the ex-Killen\\'s career as a target, and were never a danger at all. UOR\\'s final conclusion, issued in March 2004, was that the ex-Killen presented minimal to no environmental danger and should be left alone as it is now serving as an artificial reef for sea life.\\n\nAwards\nKillen received two battle stars for World War II service.\\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n"

Villalba\\'s emergency operations center and an assisted living center were among the many buildings destroyed in Villalba.  Villalba received 27.82 inches of rain. The mayor\\'s stated \"Our main need is oxygen. Many people depend on oxygen through artificial respirators that require electricity.\".  \\n\n\"From Catastrophe to Hope\" ( De la catastrofe a la esperanza ), a documentary describing the destruction of infrastructure in Villalba and how volunteers, community members, the mayor, and emergency service personnel worked to try to save people\\'s lives was published in 2019 by Noticias de Villalba (Villalba News). The mountainous geography of Villalba made restoring electricity and water services extremely challenging. Chaplains , and religious leaders of all denominations, provided emotional support to all involved.  \\n\n\\nSubsequent to the hurricane, in 2018, Javier Hernández, the mayor discussed other options for electrical power, such as micro-grids, for Villalba, with the mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey , reminding him that recovery from such a powerful hurricane would take years.   Architect Jonathan Marvel talked about his company\\'s plans to build an off-the-grid, 41-unit building in Villalba on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria. \nGeography\nVillalba is located in the central region of Puerto Rico, on a valley in the Cordillera Central .  The highest point in the municipality is Cerro El Bolo at 3,526 feet (1,075 m) of elevation.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Villalba is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Villalba: Chino neighborhood, Cooperativa neighborhood, Hato Puerco Arriba, Apeaderos, Sector Cubones in Caonillas Arriba, Palmarejo in Villalba Arriba, Céspedes in Pino, Cerro Gordo and Sector El Semil in Villalba Arriba.   \\n\nEnergy consortium\nAn Energy Consortium was signed in late February, 2019 by the mayors of Villalba, Orocovis , Morovis , Ciales and Barranquitas municipalities. The consortium is the first of its kind for the island. It is intended to have municipalities work together to safeguard their communities, in the event of a catastrophe, by creating resilient, and efficient energy networks with backups.  \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nEconomy\nCulture\nVillalba celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Sra. del Carmen is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Villalba include:\\n\nIn 2017, Villalba celebrated the 100th year of its founding.  \\n\nGovernment\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years. Waldemar Rivera Torres (of the Popular Democratic Party ) served as mayor since 2005 to 2012. The current mayor is Javier (Javi) Hernández who was elected in 2013.  \\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VI , which is represented by two senators. In 2012, Miguel Pereira Castillo and Angel M. Rodríguez were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nFour horizontal, unequal stripes in width, that from top to bottom have the following order: green, white, green and yellow. In the immediate side to the flagstaff, in the superior stripe, appears, in white color, the star of the shield.  \\n\nOn a green background, representing land, a 19th-century villa, reflected by six homes and a church in silver and red, the church is adorned with the shield of Carmelites , and a white star prominently displays and shines over the villa. Around its border are five fig leaves. Atop are three golden towers.  \\n\nTransportation\nIn 1918, Villalba was not yet connected to neighboring towns or municipalities. By 1927, Villalba was connected to Juana Díaz , and other neighboring municipalities with Puerto Rico Highway 149 .\\n\nThere are 23 bridges in Villalba.  \\n\nEducation\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nVilla Pesquera\n\\n\nVilla Pesquera is a sea-front fishing village in barrio Playa , in the municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico . The site is one of the tourist attractions in the municipality of Ponce.  \\n\nLocation\nFormerly an ad hoc group of fishermen, Villa Pesquera was re-organized and inaugurated in 1992 under the administration of Ponce Mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago .  The village is located on the southern Puerto Rico\\'s Caribbean Sea shores, on Avenida Padre Noel in barrio Playa in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The village includes a restaurant by the same name - Restaurante Villa Pesquera.  \\n\nManagement\nThe cooperative-style village is staffed by \"veteran fishermen \" and presided by Miguel Ortiz Maldonado. The village experiences double its activity during the weeks in February and March associated with the religious festivities of lent .  Their cooperative is named \"Asociación de Pescadores de la Playa de Ponce (APPP).\"  \\n\nActivity\nIn 2013, there were 54 active fishermen at the village.  The most sought after fish is the Sierra . The village is frequented by both private individuals as well as businesses seeking to fill their restaurant-related needs. Some fishermen will only fish Sierra due to its high demand. This is followed by chillo , carrucho , and lobster .  \\n\nToday\nThe Villa Pesquera facilities are owned by the Municipality of Ponce, but operated by the fishermen themselves. The 2013 speaker of the group is José Montero Rosado. In July 2013 it was made public that the Ponce Municipal Government was interested in passing control of the village to a private commercial operator.  \\n\nDredging and boardwalk\nThe Villa Pesquera waters have been a victim of problems associated with too much sediment . To control the problem a dredging project was started in 2013. The city spent some $185,000 in the project but, by mid-2013, still much more work was needed to complete the project.  The sediment problem has been acknowledged by the Villa Pesquera lieutenant in charge of the Maritime Unit of the village security force, José Santiago Santiago, who is also in charge of the tree vessels patrolling the area. The security force is unable to use the Villa Pesquera dock because of the sediment problem.  As a result, security vessels dock and undock in the Puerto Viejo sector of barrio Playa.  \\n\nThe village also has a boardwalk as part of its docking facilities.  The Villa Pesquera boardwalk was reconstructed in 2013 at a cost of over $60,000.  \\n\nControversy\nIn July 2013, the APPP accused the Ponce Municipal Government, headed by Mayor María Meléndez Altieri of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico , of attempting to negotiate a new operations contract with a different operator on political grounds. The APPP identified the principals of the proposed new operational cooperative as members of the same political New Progressive Party as the municipal government\\'s administration. Meanwhile, the municipal government did not provide an official reply to the fishermen\\'s demands for information.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n17°58\\xe2\\x80\\xb254.8394\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°37\\xe2\\x80\\xb222.4034\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 17.981899833°N 66.622889833°W ﻿ / 17.981899833; -66.622889833 \\n"

        "page_content": "Contents\nWest Indian manatee\n\\n\nThe West Indian manatee ( Trichechus manatus ), also known as the North American manatee , is a large, aquatic mammal native to warm coastal areas of the Caribbean, from the Eastern United States to northern Brazil. Living alone or in herds, it feeds on underwater plants and uses its whiskers to navigate. It is divided into two subspecies, the Florida manatee ( T. m. latirostris ) in the United States and the Antillean manatee ( T. m. manatus ) in the Caribbean,   both of which are endangered and face pressure from habitat loss, pollution, and other human activity. The West Indian manatee is the largest living member of the sirenians (order Sirenia), a group of large aquatic mammals that includes the dugong , other manatees , and the extinct Steller\\'s sea cow .\\n\nManatees are herbivores , have developed vocal communication abilities, and are covered in highly sensitive whiskers (called vibrissae ) that are used for feeding and navigation.  In breeding season, several males form mating herds around an individual female; on average, one calf is born to a female manatee every two to three years.  \\n\nIn the 1970s, the West Indian manatee was listed as \"endangered\" in the United States under the Endangered Species Act , when there were only several hundred left.  The decades since have witnessed significant efforts to protect this species from natural and human threats, particularly collisions with watercraft .  In 2017, the United States changed the classification to \"threatened\", citing a substantial increase in the total population .   \\n\nDescription\nThe average West Indian manatee is about 2.7-3.5 m (8.9-11.5 ft) long and weighs 200-600 kg (440-1,320 lb), with females generally larger than males.  The largest individual on record weighed 1,655 kg (3,649 lb) and measured 4.6 m (15 ft) long.   Manatees are estimated to live 50 years or more in the wild,  and one captive Florida manatee, Snooty , lived for 69 years (1948-2017).  \\n\nGiven that manatees are mammals , they breathe air, have warm blood, and produce milk. Like the other sirenians , the West Indian manatee has adapted fully to aquatic life, having no hind limbs. Instead of hind limbs, the manatee has a spatula-like paddle for propulsion in the water. Manatees have evolved streamlined bodies which lack external ear flaps, thus decreasing resistance in the aquatic environment. Pelage cover is sparsely distributed across the body, which may play a role in reducing the build-up of algae on their thick skin. Manatee skin is gray but can vary in coloration due to algae and other biota, like barnacles , that opportunistically live on manatees.  Scar tissue on manatees is white and persists for decades, allowing for easy identification. The Florida manatee has three to four nails on each flipper.  \\n\nThe West Indian manatee has a prehensile snout, like their relative the elephant , for grabbing vegetation and bringing it into their mouths. Manatees have six to eight molariform teeth in each jaw quadrant. These molariform teeth are generated at the back of the mouth and slowly migrate towards the front of the mouth, at a rate of 1-2 mm per month, where they then fall out. This tooth \\xe2\\x80\\x98conveyor belt' provides unlimited tooth production which is  beneficial for the manatee which feeds on vegetation four to eight hours per day and consumes 5-10% of its body weight per day. Manatees have 3-5 cm hairs that cover their whole body and provide somatosensory information . Manatee bones are dense and solid which allows them to act as ballast and promote negative buoyancy. This helps counteract the positive buoyancy which comes from their high fat content. These two buoyancy counterparts, along with air in the lungs, helps manatees achieve neutral buoyancy in the water.  This makes breathing, foraging, and swimming easier for the manatee. Manatees are unique, compared to other mammals, in that they have a longitudinally oriented diaphragm that is split in half to form two hemidiaphragms. Each hemidiaphragm is capable of independent muscular contractions.  \\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe West Indian manatee inhabits mostly shallow coastal areas, including rivers and estuaries .  Manatees can withstand large changes in salinity and are found in both freshwater and saltwater.  Manatees\\' extremely low metabolic rate and lack of a thick layer of insulating body fat limits them to locations with warm waters, including tropical regions.\\n\nThe Florida subspecies is primarily found along the Florida coast, but has been spotted as far north as Dennis, Massachusetts , as well as along the Gulf Coast of Texas .  Concerning their forays inland, a manatee was once spotted in the Wolf River (near where it enters the Mississippi) in Memphis, Tennessee , in 2006: a distance of over 700 river miles from the Gulf of Mexico.  The Antillean subspecies has a sparse distribution throughout the Caribbean , ranging as far north as Mexico and as far south as Brazil .   \\n\nAn analysis of mitochondrial DNA patterns indicates there are actually three primary geographic groups of the West Indian manatee: (i) Florida and the Greater Antilles ; (ii) Mexico, Central America and northern South America; and (iii) northeastern South America.   \\n\nThe seasonal distribution of the West Indian manatee varies with water temperatures. Temperatures below approximately 20 °C (68 °F) increase the risk of cold-induced stress or mortality for manatees.   Consequently, Florida manatees seek out warm-water refuges during the winter, concentrated primarily along the Florida peninsula.  Many of these refuges are artificial, created by the runoff from nearby power plants.  In contrast, the Antillean manatee is less susceptible to cold-induced stress due to the warmer waters across its range.\\n\nFlorida manatees inhabit the most northern limit of sirenian habitats. There are four recognized subpopulations of the Florida manatee, termed the Northwest, Southwest, Atlantic Coast and St. John\\'s River populations.  Large concentrations of Florida manatees are located in the Crystal River  and Blue Springs regions in central and north Florida. The Antillean manatee is sparsely distributed throughout the Caribbean and the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, from Mexico , east to the Greater Antilles , and south to Brazil . Populations can also be found in The Bahamas , French Guiana , Suriname , Guyana , Trinidad , Venezuela , Colombia , Panama , Costa Rica , Cura\\xc3 7ao , Nicaragua , Honduras , Guatemala , Belize , Cuba , the Dominican Republic , Jamaica and Puerto Rico . It is possibly extirpated from the Turks and Caicos Islands , and definitively so from all the Lesser Antilles except Trinidad and Cura\\xc3 7ao. Its presence in Haiti is uncertain.  A reintroduction was planned to take place in Guadeloupe , but was terminated early due to political issues.  \\n\nBehavior and diet\nBecause manatees evolved in habitats without natural predators, they lack predator avoidance behavior.  The large size and low metabolic rates of manatees lends to their capacity for long and deep dives, as well as their relative lack of speed. Manatees are frequently solitary creatures, but they do aggregate at warm-water habitats during the winter and during the formation of breeding herds.  In spite of their docile demeanor, due to their large size the West Indian manatee has nearly no natural predators in its native environment. American alligators and American crocodiles have been suspected to on occasion take a manatee.   A dying manatee was discovered in Puerto Rico, wounded by a large shark bite thought to be inflicted by either a tiger shark or bull shark .  It is projected that large sharks may threaten manatees occasionally but rarely enter the manatee\\'s brackish habitats, whereas marine mammals in more direct coastal oceanic waters are well known to be highly vulnerable to sharks and orcas .  \\n\nManatees have been shown to form large mating herds when males come across estrous females, indicating that males may be able to sense estrogen or other chemical indicators.   Manatees can communicate information to each other through their vocalization patterns.  Sex and age-related differences are apparent in the vocalization structure of common squeaks and screeches in adult males, adult females, and juveniles.    This may be an indication of vocal individuality among manatees.  An increase in manatee vocalization after a vocal playback stimulus shows that they may be able to recognize another manatee\\'s individual voice.  This behavior in manatees is found mostly between mother and calf interactions.  However, vocalization can still be commonly found in a variety of social interactions within groups of manatees, which is similar to other aquatic mammals.  [ citation needed ] When communicating in noisy environments, manatees that are in groups experience the same Lombard effect as humans do; where they will involuntary increase their vocal effort when communicating in loud environments.  Based on acoustic and anatomical evidence, mammalian vocal folds are assumed to be the mechanism for sound production in manatees.  Manatees also eat other manatees\\' feces; it is assumed that they do this to gather information about reproductive status or dominance, indicating the important role chemoreception plays in the social and reproductive behavior of manatees.  \\n\nManatees are obligate herbivores that feed on over 60 species of aquatic plants in both fresh and salt water. Seagrass is a staple of the manatee diet, particularly in coastal areas.    In addition, when the tide is high enough, they will also feed on grasses, roots and leaves (including those of mangroves ), as well as algae.    Manatees typically graze for five or more hours per day, consuming anywhere from 4% to 10% of their body weight in wet vegetation per day, though the exact amount depends on their body size and activity level.  Because manatees feed on abrasive plants, their molars are often worn down and are replaced many times throughout their lives, thus earning the nickname \"marching molars.\" The molar teeth are similar in shape, but of varying sizes. Manatees do not have incisors; these have been replaced by horny gingival plates.  Some individuals may also inadvertently eat invertebrates (such as small aquatic insects and crustaceans) and will eat fish both in captivity and in the wild.   \\n\nManatees are nonruminants with an enlarged hindgut . Unlike other hindgut fermenters, such as the horse, manatees efficiently extract nutrients, particularly cellulose, from the aquatic plants in their diet. Manatees have a large gastrointestinal tract with contents measuring about 23% of its total body mass. In addition, the passage rate of food is very long (about seven days).  This slow process increases the digestibility of their diet. It is suggested that chronic fermentation may also provide additional heat and is correlated with their low metabolic rate.  \\n\nManatees have sensitive tactile hairs that cover their bodies and faces called whiskers or vibrissae . Each individual hair is a vibrissal apparatus called a follicle-sinus complex. Vibrissae are blood filled sinuses bound by a dense connective tissue capsule with sensitive nerve endings that provides haptic feedback to the manatee.  \\n\nUsually vibrissae are found on the facial regions of terrestrial and non-sirenian aquatic animals and are called whiskers .  Manatees, however, have vibrissae all over their bodies. The vibrissae located in their facial region are roughly 30 times denser than the vibrissae on the rest of their body. Their mouth consists of very mobile prehensile lips which are used for grasping food and objects. The vibrissae on these lips are turned outward during grasping and are used in locating vegetation. Their oral disks also contain vibrissae which have been classified as bristle-like hairs that are used in nongrasping investigation of objects and food.   \\n\nManatee vibrissae are so sensitive that they are able to perform active touch discrimination of textures. Manatees also use their vibrissae to navigate the turbid waterways of their environment. Research has indicated that they are able to use these vibrissae to detect hydrodynamic stimuli in the same way that fish use their lateral line system.  \\n\nReproduction\nMale manatees reach sexual maturity at 3-4 years of age, while females reach sexual maturity at 3-5 years of age.   Manatees appear capable of breeding throughout their entire adult life, although most females first breed successfully at ages 7-9.  Breeding occurs in ephemeral mating herds, where several males aggregate around an estrous female and compete for access to her.  These mating herds can last up to 2 to 4 weeks. The estrous cycles of female manatees typically are approximately one month long. Females in captivity have been observed to skip cycles.  Larger males, presumably older, have been observed to dominate mating herds and are likely responsible for most successful copulation events.  However, between males and females there is a little sexual dimorphism where females are typically slightly larger than males.  \\n\nThe reproductive anatomy of males consists of internal testes within the abdominal cavity, which are located posterior to the kidneys. In the Florida manatee, males experience seasonal changes in their spermatogenesis. They are active during the warm breeding season; during this time all stages of spermatogenesis can be seen. However, during the cold non-breeding season, they are inactive, and spermatogenesis is inhibited.  \\nRecently there has been a study that shows support that males use chemosensation for the anal glands to locate females in estrous.  \\n\nThe reproductive anatomy of females is most like that of elephants. Female manatees resemble elephants in their zonary placenta, bicornuate uterus, and corpora albicantia. The female manatees' ovary gross morphology consists of an oval disk shape with a flat surface of the cortex. And since they are polyovular the ovulation scar is often challenging to identify.  \\n\nThe gestation period in manatees lasts for 12-14 months, after which they give birth to one calf at a time or, rarely, twins.  When twins are born, they are fraternal twins and are dizygotic.  When a calf is born, it usually weighs 60-70 lb (27-32 kg) and is  4.0-4.5 ft (1.2-1.4 m) long. Manatees do not form permanent pair bonds , and the male contributes no parental care to the calf, which remains with the mother for up to two years prior to weaning. Female manatees have two axillary mammary glands located under their flippers. The lactation period for mothers and their calves last typically for one to two years. Prior to weaning, there is an increase in the hormone progesterone in the mother.  \\nDuring this two-year period with their mother, calves learn how to locate warm water sources for winter and about migration routes for the summer seasons.  A single female can reproduce once every 2-3 years, which is referred to as the calving interval.  Wild manatees have been documented producing offspring into their late 30s, and a female captive manatee has given birth in her 40s.  \\n\nCaptive breeding programs are not being conducted for the Florida manatee due to conservation concerns that are being addressed in their natural environments. Until these concerns are rectified, a captive breeding program will not be beneficial for this species.  \\n\nThreats and conservation\nThe West Indian manatee has been included on the U.S. Endangered Species List since the 1970s.  In October 2007, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed the West Indian manatee as vulnerable, and both the Florida and Antillean subspecies as endangered.  The full species and both subspecies qualified for their respective classifications due to a combination of a low number of mature individuals, and a significant projected decline in total population numbers over the next two generations (about 20 years per generation in manatees). Similarly, NatureServe considers both the Florida subspecies and the species as a whole as \"Imperiled\".   \\n\nThe Florida and Antillean subspecies face different threats, though some overlap. The largest causes of Florida manatee deaths can be attributed to collisions with watercraft, the loss of warm-water habitat, high perinatal mortality, entanglements and ingestion of debris, pollution, habitat loss, and harmful algae blooms (HABs), such as red tide .    Antillean manatees face severe habitat fragmentation ,  as well as continued pressure from illegal hunting.  In some countries, like Belize, collisions with watercraft are on the rise as tourism grows.   \\n\nThe 2017 decision to reclassify the West Indian manatee from endangered to threatened under the Endangered Species Act cited increases in the populations of both subspecies.  The decision was not without controversy, however: According to Save the Manatee Club , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service failed to adequately consider data from 2010 to 2016, during which time manatees suffered from unprecedented mortality events linked to habitat pollution, dependence on artificial warm-water sources, and record deaths from watercraft strikes.  The official notice of the reclassification made clear that, even with the downlisting, all federal protections for the West Indian manatee under the Endangered Species Act would remain in place.  The West Indian manatee is also protected by the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978  and the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 .\\n\nA 1997 population viability analysis of the Florida manatee projected a 44% chance of extinction within the next 1,000 years without improvements in habitat conditions and new protective regulations.  Since then, prospects for the subspecies have improved. In 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey collaborated with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Service to re-evaluate the status of the Florida manatee under the Core Biological Model, which is used to estimate population viability. This assessment analyzed total population on the east and west coasts of Florida and estimated that the likelihood of either population falling under 500 adults within 100 years was about 0.42%.  The projected improvement of population numbers and stability is contingent on continued intervention and monitoring efforts.\\n\nOver 20% of manatee mortalities per year are a result of watercraft collisions.  Between 1985 and 2017, 53% of adult-manatee mortalities were the result of boat strikes.  96% of adult Florida manatee carcasses have scars from a boat collision with some individuals showing signs of 10 or more boat strikes.  Manatees can hear boats, but they oftentimes do not have enough time to get out of the way of a fast approaching boat. A boat going at a slower speed gives the manatee more time to react and move out of the way.   Manatees respond to approaching vessels by orienting towards deeper waters and increasing their speed,   but they are nevertheless frequently struck as they don\\'t have the ability to swim very fast and, in shallow habitat, they oftentimes don\\'t have anywhere to go to get out of the way. Over half of all watercraft deaths are caused by the impact trauma from the hull of a fast-speeding boat, whereas the remaining percentage is caused by the boat propeller.  Aerial surveys of Florida manatee and boat distribution have been conducted to map the areas in which collisions are most likely to occur, accounting for environmental and seasonal factors.  Watercraft can frequently avoid hitting manatees simply by reducing speed, allowing time for the manatee to escape out of range.  Despite improvements in modeling and changes to local regulations, manatee mortalities from watercraft collisions continue to rise, with an all-time high of 137 recorded deaths in 2019.  \\n\nProjected long-term loss of warm-water habitats presents a significant risk to manatees, which are unable to tolerate temperatures lower than 20 °C (68 °F) for prolonged periods of time.   Florida manatees frequently congregate around natural warm-water springs, as well as the warm discharge given off by power plants throughout the winter months. However, as older plants are replaced with more energy-efficient structures, manatees could become at risk of cold-induced death due to reduced availability of warm-water refuges.     Manatees exhibit high site fidelity and can recall previous refuge sites to which they frequently return in successive winters. Some conservationists fear that manatees may become overly reliant on warm-water locations generated by power plants that may shut down soon.   Natural warm-water springs face problems from over-pumping of groundwater for human consumption, reduced spring flow, and nutrient pollution. In addition, some springs that were historically accessible to manatees are blocked off by dams or other structures.    As Florida moves towards net zero by 2050, power companies will likely phase out these warm water discharges.  Florida Climate Institute's Laying the Groundwork for \\xe2\\x80\\x98Getting to Neutral' in the State of Florida project sets a foundation for a net-zero action planning effort in Florida by 2050.  In areas where manatees lack access to power plants or natural warm springs, they instead seek out natural deep water zones that passively remain above tolerable temperatures.  \\n\nHarmful algae blooms are an additional threat to manatees.   Red tide is a common name for algal blooms, deriving its distinctive color from pigmentation molecules in the algae. The blooms produce brevetoxins which are potentially fatal to marine life. Most manatee deaths from red tide occur when manatees inhale the toxins, or ingest the toxins when consuming seagrass, their primary food source.  During a 1996 epizootic more than 150 manatees died from red tide exposure.  Although manatees can survive exposure to red tide if rescued and rehabilitated in time, researchers fear that there might be long-term effects from sub-lethal red-tide exposure, which can affect the manatee\\'s immune system through reduced lymphocyte proliferation response.  In addition to red tide, blue/green and brown algae blooms triggered by excessive nutrient pollution from fertilizer, runoff, and leaking septic tanks can cloud the water. This results in seagrasses dying off since seagrasses and aquatic plants need light to photosynthesize. Manatees in turn may not be able to find sufficient food sources, which can lead to starvation.       Manatees have experienced several Unusual Mortality Events (UMEs) over the years, which are usually related to either cold-stress syndrome, or brevetoxicosis from red tide. A current UME is ongoing along the Atlantic coast of Florida and is most likely related to a shortage in food sources.   \\n\nManatees easily can get entangled in monofilament fishing line, crab traps, and other debris, which can lead to the loss of flippers and severe body wraps. In addition, they may also ingest a variety of debris, such as plastics, cloth, fishing gear, and other items.    Manatees can also get crushed by flood control structures and locks and may get entrapped behind weirs or other structures, especially after heavy rainfall. Some manatees have gotten trapped in culverts and pipes and needed intervention.  \\n\nThere is relatively little data on the Antillean manatee compared to its Florida counterpart.  Phylogenetic studies on the Antillean manatee have revealed low genetic diversity among its populations, likely due to limitations on dispersal.   Captive breeding, as well as the rehabilitation of manatee calves discovered without their mothers nearby, can supplement local conservation strategies, but populations are nevertheless at risk of inbreeding depression and local extinction.   \\n\nWhereas the population trends of the Florida manatee are relatively well monitored, population data for the Antillean manatee is sparse due to its patchy distribution, as well as the relative turbidity and low levels of light in its habitat which can mitigate the effectiveness of aerial or sonar-based surveys, often resulting in inaccurate or erroneous measurements.   A 2016 study on the Antillean manatee population of Brazil found a potential range for current population size between 485 and 2,221 individuals.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated in 2017 that as many as 6,782 individuals might exist in the Antillean subspecies, but these results rely in large part on personal anecdotes and may overestimate the true population number.  A 2012 study of the Antillean population documented significant human-related causes of mortality, and projected that if the share of human-caused manatee deaths per year rose to 5% or more, the population would face a severe decline and eventual extinction.  \\n\nReferences\nExternal links"

Whale watching is mostly a recreational activity (cf. birdwatching ), but it can also serve scientific and/or educational purposes.  A study prepared for International Fund for Animal Welfare in 2009 estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generates $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers.  The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource .\\n\nHistory\nOrganized whale watching started in the United States, when the Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego was declared a public venue for observing the migration of gray whales ; the spectacle attracted 10,000 visitors in its first year, 1950.  In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters.  The industry spread throughout the western coast of the United States over the following decade.  \\n\nIn 1971 the Montreal Zoological Society commenced the first commercial whale watching activity on the eastern side of North America, offering trips in the St. Lawrence River to view fin and beluga whales .  By the mid-1970s, live captures for aquaria had reduced the orca populations in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington, particularly the southern resident orca population. According to their scientific chroniclers, in the 1980s commercial whale watching started becoming an alternative means of viewing and appreciating orcas.  In 1984, Erich Hoyt , who had spent much time amongst the orcas of British Columbia, published the first comprehensive book on whale watching, The Whale Watcher\\'s Handbook , which Mark Carwardine called his number one \"natural classic\" book in BBC Wildlife magazine.  \\n\nBy 1985 more visitors watched whales from New England than California. The rapid growth in this area has been attributed to the relatively dense population of humpback whales , whose acrobatic behavior such as breaching (jumping out of the water) and tail-slapping thrilled observers, and the close proximity of whale populations to the large cities there.  \\n\nWhale watching tourism has grown substantially since the mid-1980s. The first worldwide survey of whale watching was conducted by Hoyt for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) in 1992. It was updated in 1995 and submitted by the UK government to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meetings as a demonstration of the value of living whales.  In 1999, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) asked Hoyt for another expansion, which was published in 2001.  In 2009 the survey was completed by a team of economists and this report estimated that in 2008, 13 million people went whale watching, up from 9 million ten years earlier. Commercial whale watching operations were found in 119 countries. Direct revenue of whale watching trips was estimated at US$872.7 million and indirect revenue of $2,113.1 million was spent by whale watchers in tourism-related businesses.  \\n\nWhale watching is of particular importance to developing countries. Coastal communities have started to profit directly from the whales\\' presence, significantly adding to popular support for the protection of these animals from commercial whaling and other threats such as bycatch and ship strikes using the tool of marine protected areas and sanctuaries. In 2007, the Humane Society International sponsored a series of workshops to introduce whale watching to coastal Peru and commissioned Hoyt to write a blueprint for high quality, sustainable whale watching.  This manual, later translated into Spanish, French, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese and Dutch, with co-sponsorship from WDCS, IFAW and Global Ocean was updated in English in 2012 in ebook form.  \\n\nConservation\nThe rapid growth of the number of whale watching trips and the size of vessel used to watch whales may affect whale behavior, migratory patterns and breeding cycles. There is now strong evidence that whale watching can significantly affect the biology and ecology of whales and dolphins.\\n\nEnvironmental campaigners, concerned by what they consider the \"quick-buck\" mentality of some boat owners, continue to strongly urge all whale watcher operators to contribute to local regulations governing whale watching (no international standard set of regulations exist because of the huge variety of species and populations). Common rules include:\\n\n(Source: WDCS )\\n\nIn Uruguay, where whales can be watched from the beach, legislators have designated the country\\'s territorial waters as a sanctuary for whales and dolphins.  It is illegal to be less than 300 metres from a whale.\\n\nLocations\nWhale watching tours are available in various locations and climates. By area, they are:\\n\nIn South Africa , the town of Hermanus is one of the world centers for whale watching. Between May and December southern right whales come so close to the Cape shoreline that visitors can watch whales from their hotels. The town employs a \"whale crier\" (cf town crier ) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen.\\n\nYou can watch the whales in Hermanus from the cliff tops, from a boat or the air. Boat-based whale watching tours are available out of the Hermanus New harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from June till Mid December. Port Elizabeth runs a boat-based whale watching tour out of the Port Elizabeth harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from July to November, humpback whales from June to August and November to January, and Bryde\\'s whales all year round, up-close. Visitors can also see humpback whales from the lighthouse at Cape Recife (the Westerly point of Algoa Bay ), and southern right whales from viewing points along the coast. Boat-based whale watching (and dolphin watching) is also a popular tourist attraction in a number of other coastal towns in South Africa, such as Plettenberg Bay, where the industry is linked to conservation and education efforts through Plettenberg Bay-based volunteer marine conservation organisations. Plettenberg Bay is visited by southern right whales in the winter months and humpback whales in the summer months. Bryde\\'s whales are resident throughout the year.  The other famous centre for whale watching is False Bay. Tours leave Gordon\\'s Bay and follow the coast around the bay. Species include southern right whales, humpback whales and Bryde\\'s whales. Orcas are present during the winter months. Visitors include pilot whales and pygmy sperm whales. Many species of dolphin are encountered including Heaviside\\'s dolphins . The same tours include great white sharks at Seal Island and the African Penguin Colony at Simon\\'s Town.\\n\nIn Brazil , humpbacks are observed off Salvador in Bahia State and at the National Marine Park of Abrolhos during their breeding season in austral winter and spring. Likewise, southern right whales are observed from shore in Santa Catarina State and Espírito Santo during the same season. Mother/calf pairs can come as close to shore as 30 meters (about 100 feet). Income from whale watching bolsters coastal communities and has made the township of Imbituba , the Brazilian \"whale capital\".\\n\nIn Argentina , Península Valdés in Patagonia hosts (in winter) the largest breeding population of southern right whales, with more than 2,000 catalogued by the Whale Conservation Institute and Ocean Alliance .  The region contains six natural reserves, and is considered to be one of the premier whale watching destinations in the world, particularly around the town of Puerto Pirámides and the city of Puerto Madryn , as the whales come within 200 m (660 ft) of the main beach and play a major part in the large ecotourism industry in the region.  \\n\nIn Uruguay , southern right whales are observable from the beach in two coastal departments - Maldonado and Rocha - from June to November.  The points where most sightings in Maldonado are made are Punta Colorada , Punta Negra , Playa Mansa and Punta Salinas in Punta del Este , and in Rocha off La Paloma and La Pedrera beaches.  \\n\nTidal straits, inlets, lagoons, and varying water temperatures provide diverse habitats for multiple cetacean species. Substantial numbers live off the coasts of Great Britain , Ireland , Iceland , Scandinavia , Portugal , Spain , and France . Commercial car ferries crossing the Bay of Biscay from Britain and Ireland to Spain and France often pass by enormous blue whales and much smaller harbor porpoise . Land-based tours can often view these animals.\\n\nOff the south coast of Ireland, humpback whales and fin whales are regularly seen on organized whale watching trips between July and February. Species seen all year include minke whales , orcas , harbour porpoises , and common , bottlenose , and Risso\\'s dolphins . There is also a resident group of bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary which attracts tourists all year round.\\n Chanonry Point is one of the best spots in the UK to view bottlenose dolphins .  The dolphins are visible from the shore, particularly on an incoming tide when they play and fish in the strong currents. Other wildlife, including porpoises and grey seals , can also regularly be spotted.\\n\nIn Northern Norway ( Nordland and Troms counties) orcas are visible in the Vestfjorden , Tysfjorden , Ofotfjorden and Andfjorden as the herring gathers in the fjords to stay over the winter and off the Lofoten islands during the summer. At Andenes on And\\xc3\\xb8ya in Vester\\xc3 5len and around Kr\\xc3\\xb8tt\\xc3\\xb8ya in Troms, sperm whales can be observed year round, summer whale watching trips occur from May till September, winter trips with killer whales and humpback whales are offered from October till April. Troms\\xc3\\xb8 also offers whale watching for sperm and other whales. The continental shelf Eggakanten and deep water where the sperm whales congregate, is very close to shore, beginning only 7,000 meters (23,000 ft) from the Andenes harbour.\\n\nIn Portugal whale watching is available in the Algarve . Lagos and Portim\\xc3 3o are the most important whale-watching places. The species observed in this area are the fin, killer, and pilot whale , and the bottlenose, common, and striped dolphin .\\n\nIn the middle of the Northeast Atlantic, around the Madeira , the Azores and the Cape Verde archipelagos, whale watching is on the increase and popular due to more protection and education. One of the most common whales in these regions is the sperm whale, especially groups of calving females.\\n\nIn Spain whale watching is available along the Strait of Gibraltar , the Canary Islands , and in the Bay of Biscay . Tarifa is the most important whale watching town in the Strait of Gibraltar; this gateway to the Mediterranean Sea is also a central point in between the colder waters to the North and the tropical waters off of Africa: a good route for migrating cetaceans. The species observed in this area are the bottlenose, common, and striped dolphin, and the pilot, sperm, fin, and killer whale.\\nIn the Canary Islands it is possible to see these and others, such as the blue, beaked , false killer , and Bryde\\'s whale , and the Atlantic spotted , rough-toothed , and Risso\\'s dolphin.\\n\nIn Iceland it is possible to see whales in Eyjafj\\xc3\\xb6r\\xc3\\xb0ur , Brei\\xc3\\xb0afj\\xc3\\xb6r\\xc3\\xb0ur , Skjálfandi and Faxaflói . The towns offering whale watching are Dalvík , Hauganes , Húsavík , Akureyri , Hólmavík , Grundarfj\\xc3\\xb6r\\xc3\\xb0ur and Reykjavík . Most common are the minke , humpback, blue, killer, and sperm whale, as well as the white-beaked dolphin , and the harbour porpoise .\\n\nIn New England and off the east coast of Long Island in the United States, the whale watching season typically takes place from about mid-spring through October, depending both on weather and precise location. It is here that the humpback whale , fin whale , minke whale , and the very endangered/heavily protected North Atlantic right whale are often observed. For generations, areas like the Gulf of Maine and Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (part of the inner waters formed by Cape Cod \\'s hooked shape) have been important feeding grounds for these species: to this day a very large portion of the waters off the Eastern Seaboard are rich in sand lance and other nutritious treats for mothers to teach their calves to feed on.  \\n\nIn the past this area was the US whaling industry\\'s capital, particularly Nantucket , an island just off the coast of Massachusetts . Though whaling has been banned for many years,  and strict laws prohibit molestation of these large wild mammals, it is not unknown for the whales to approach whale watching boats uninvited, particularly curious calves and juveniles: it is not unknown in particular, for example, for juvenile humpbacks to approach the boat and spyhop to get a better look at the humans aboard. In recent years it is also not uncommon to see these animals playing and feeding in harbors, including New York City or Boston where fish species of interest to the whales have lately returned in astonishing numbers. As of 2011, an expert from Cornell University has recorded the vocalizations of six whale species including the humpback, the fin whale, and the massive blue whale within close proximity of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in the lower portion of New York Harbor and there is at least one company offering marine life tours out of The Rockaway Peninsula in Queens.   Due to these increasingly frequent visits, new laws address the safety of boaters, commercial fishermen, and the whales themselves: off the coast of Boston, for example, cargo vessels must slow down to protect the much slower North Atlantic right whale and there is talk of erecting an apparatus for the much more heavily trafficked waters surrounding New York City that can warn boats of a whale\\'s presence and location so as to avoid accidentally striking the animal.  Because of the relative diversity of whales and dolphins within easy access of shore, cetacean research takes place at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute , and the Riverhead Foundation among other centers.\\n\nEastern Canada has many whale watching tours in the estuary and gulf of St. Laurence River , in Newfoundland and Labrador , Quebec , Nova Scotia or New Brunswick . Twenty-two species of whales and dolphins frequent the waters of Newfoundland and Labrador, although the most common are the humpback, minke, fin, Beluga and killer whales. Another popular whale-watching area is at Tadoussac, Quebec , where Belugas favor the extreme depth and admixture of cold fresh water from the Saguenay River into the inland end of the Gulf of St. Lawrence . Humpbacks, minkes, fin and blue whales are also frequently seen off Tadoussac. The Bay of Fundy is an equally important feeding ground for large baleen whales and dozens of other creatures of the sea; it shares a population of migrating humpbacks with America and is a known summer nursery for mother right whales with calves.  \\n\nOn the east coast of the United States, Virginia Beach, Virginia whale watching is a winter activity from the end of December until the middle of March. Fin, humpback, and right whales are seen off the Virginia Beach coast on whale watching boat trips run by the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center.  Sightings are mostly of juveniles who stay near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay where food is plentiful, while the adults continue to the Caribbean to mate. \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" pick up their offspring on the way back north where the whole family summers.\\n\nEcotourism based on kayak trips is gaining in popularity in warm-water vacation destinations such as Sarasota Keys . Guided kayak trips take kayakers on a tour of the local ecosystem. Kayakers can watch dolphins breach and manatees eat sea grass, in shallow bay water.  \\n\nThe waters surrounding Virginia are also a known migration corridor for the endangered North Atlantic right whale : Pregnant females must pass through this area around December to reach their birthing grounds down the coast in Georgia and Florida. For these reasons the waters between the Delmarva Peninsula and the barrier islands that stretch southwards towards northern Florida must be monitored every winter and spring as mothers give birth to their calves, nurse them, and then ready themselves and their younglings to return north for the cooler waters near New England and Canada.\\n\nAbout 25 species are observed in the Caribbean Sea \\'s waters, such as humpback whales, sperm whales, beaked whales and many other small cetaceans. Principal whale watching activities are done in Samaná Bay in the Dominican Republic , a known breeding ground for humpbacks. Caribwhale and the Caribbean Whale Watch Association include operators engaged in sustainable whale watching activity, as well as experts, conservationists and research groups, such as the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Dalhousie University and Association Evasion Tropicale.\\n\nOn the South and East Coasts of Sri Lanka and The Maldives , the industry is growing. During winter and summer, pygmy blue and sperm whales cross the southern tip of the island, migrating to the warmer waters of Southeast Asia.\\nMany pygmy blue whales can be seen at Dondra point in Sri Lanka, accessed through the Mirissa or Weligama harbour. Whale-watching tours can be arranged in Sri Lanka.\\nBlue whales and some types of dolphins can be seen in the sea of Mirissa in Sri Lanka. Many sightings have been reported from November to April.\\n\nIn the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals, located in the waters of Italy, France and Monaco, there are eight species of marine mammals residents, most of them all year.  Frequent summer excursions depart from the ports of Genoa and Imperia, in Liguria, Northern Italy.\\n\nIn Colombia , the towns of Bahía Solano and Nuquí are visited by a large number of Humpback whales from late July to the beginning of October.  In southern Costa Rica, Marino Ballena National Park has two seasons when whales visit. [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn Panama , the Pearl Islands archipelago receive an estimated 300 humpbacks whale from late June to late November. These had become now the main attraction for whale watching tours starting in Panama City . In the Gulf of Chiriqui , the World Heritage Site of Coiba Island National Park and the islands near the town of Boca Chica are offering opportunities for whale watching. Isla Iguana near Pedasi is now a popular destination for whale watchers. Several foundations train local community members to perform as guide and captains for whale watching tours.\\n\nIn Ecuador , from June to September, there are many sites from which large groups of humpback whales can be seen, including Isla de la Plata (AKA Little Galapagos) and Salinas , at the tip of the Santa Elena Peninsula .  \\n\nOn the West Coast of Canada and the United States, excellent whale watching can be found in Alaska (summer), British Columbia, and the San Juan Islands/Puget Sound in Washington , where whales are \\nsighted from shore nearly every day, year-round.  Three types of orca pods can be observed in the Northeast Pacific: resident, transient, and offshore killer whales.   \\n\nOn the Oregon Coast , several whale species, especially gray whales , may be seen year-round, and the state trains volunteers to assist tourists in the winter months, during whale migration season.  In California , good whale-watching can be found year-round on the Southern California coast. During the winter and spring (December-May), gray whales can be seen from shore on their annual migration (the best spot being Point Vicente ), while blue whales are often seen between July and October. Fin whales , minke whales , orcas , and various species of dolphins can be seen year-round.  In spring, summer, and fall at the Farallon Islands off San Francisco , one may see humpbacks , grays , and blue whales .\\n\nIn Mexico , the various lagoons of Baja California Sur become breeding habitat for gray whales in February and March.   \\nHumpback whales can be seen off the southern tip of Baja California,  and off Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco on the west coast of Mexico,  and Barra de Potosi on the south coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero.  A number of towns in Mexico celebrate the whale\\'s arrival with festivals such as Guerrero Negro , in the first half of February and the port of San Blas on 24 and 25 February.  \\n\nIn late March 2021, a 70-foot (21 m) blue whale was spotted near the Orange County, California coastline. These mammals are typically seen in summer months, but this blue whale was spotted out of season, heading north, close to the Balboa Pier and Newport Beach shoreline.  \\n\nEach winter 4,000 to 10,000 North Pacific humpback whales migrate from Alaska to Hawaii . In the vast waters that line Alaska\\'s coast, an encounter with a whale is likely. In the summer, after thousands of whales have made their way to the rich feeding grounds of Alaska waters, sightings are extremely common. [ citation needed ] Whale watching is possible within as well as outside the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary . The best places to see whales in Hawai\\xca\\xbbi is in the protected channels between the Hawai\\xca\\xbbian islands. The best months to see the whales here are January and February when you can expect to see between 2 and 4 whales per 15 minute period,  although fluctuations between 0 and 20 sightings are normal.  \\n\nMany countries in Asia have large whale watching industries. In 2008 the largest, in terms of number of tourists, were mainland China, Taiwan and Japan. India, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines and the Maldives also have dolphin watching and some whale watching. China\\'s dolphin watching is almost entirely focussed on Sanniang Bay in Guangxi . Taiwan has several whale watching ports on its east coast. Japan has a range of whale and dolphin watching businesses on all main islands and Okinawa , Zamami, Ogasawara, Mikura-Jima and Miyake-jima.  \\n\nIn the Philippines , over thirty species of whales and dolphins can be observed around Pamilacan in Central Visayas , Davao Gulf , the northern coast of the province-island Babuyan Islands in Batanes , Pasaleng Bay , and Malampaya Sound , Palawan . The Visayas is particularly known area for dolphin sightings, and is home to one of the larger populations of the Fraser\\'s dolphin in the world. Dolphin species in the Visayas are attracted to fish lures and to commercial fishing operations. In the northernmost province of Batanes, at least 12 species of whales and dolphins has been sighted, making it the single location in the country with the highest cetacean diversity. There seems to be no specific whale watching season in the Philippines, although the calmer waters of the summer season typically provides the best conditions. Some populations, like those of the Irrawaddy dolphin , Bryde\\'s whale , and humpback whales in Batanes, appear migratory. Other populations have yet to be studied. Some former coastal whaling communities in the Philippines have also started to generate whale watching income.  \\n\nIn the Gulf of Corcovado and the waters of Guaitecas Archipelago a variety of whales and dolphins can be been spotted, including: Peale\\'s dolphins , black dolphins , bottlenose dolphins , humpback whales , minke whales and killer whales .   The Gulf of Corcovado is \"arguably the largest feeding and nursing ground for blue whales [...] in the entire Southern Hemisphere\".  All of this makes Guaitecas Archipelago a privilidged place for whale watching.  In the localities of Piñihuil , Quellón and Melinka local fishermen offer whale watching tours.  \\n\nKaik\\xc5\\x8dura in New Zealand is a world-famous whale-watching site. The sea around Kaik\\xc5\\x8dura supports an abundance of sea life, with the town\\'s income stemming largely from the tourism generated from whale watching and swimming with or around dolphins. Recently the sperm whale watching at Kaik\\xc5\\x8dura has developed rapidly and now it is an industry leader, arguably the most developed in the world. The town went into recession after the collapse of whaling in New Zealand . Its recent development has been used to advocate the benefits of watching whales instead of hunting them.\\n\nThe Sunshine Coast and Hervey Bay (where the whales stay and rest before migrating) in Queensland , Australia offer reliable whale watching conditions for southern humpback whales from the end of June through to the end of November each year. Whale numbers and activity have increased markedly in recent years. [ when? ] Sydney , Eden , Port Stephens , Narooma and Byron Bay in New South Wales are other popular hot spots for tours from May to November.\\n\nSouthern right whales are seen June-August along the south coast of Australia. They are often readily viewed from the coast around Encounter Bay near Victor Harbor and up to a hundred at a time may be seen from the cliff tops at the head of the Great Australian Bight near Yalata . See also Whaling in Australia .\\n\nIn Western Australia , whales are watched near Cape Naturaliste in the south-east Indian Ocean and at Cape Leeuwin where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.\\n\nIn the Southern Ocean there are many spots to see whales, both from land or aboard ship. Albany on the south coast of Western Australia the town where the last land based whaling station in the southern hemisphere was located is now home to a thriving whale watching industry. In Victoria a popular site is Logan\\'s Beach at Warrnambool , as well as in the waters off Port Fairy and Portland .  In Tasmania whales can be seen all along the east coast and even on the River Derwent .  In South Australia whales are watched in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park areas and closer to Adelaide at Victor Harbor .  \\n\nIn eastern Australia, whale watching occurs in many spots along the Pacific coast. From headlands, whales may often be seen making their migration south. At times, whales even make it into Sydney Harbour .\\n\nNew South Wales National Parks and Wildlife took an active role in 2010 during the peak southern whale watching  season between May and November with the launch of its whale watching site.  \\n\nWhaling and whale watching\nThe three biggest whaling nations ( Canada , Greenland and Norway ) have growing whale watching industries. The next four whaling nations ( Japan , United States , Russia and Iceland ) also have whale watching industries. Indeed, Iceland had the fastest-growing whale watching industry in the world between 1994 and 1998.  \\n\nWhale watching and hunting take place in different regions of Canada: the former mainly on Atlantic and Pacific coasts, the latter exclusively in the Arctic. Whale watching happens in the Saint Lawrence River, western Hudson\\'s Bay near Churchill, and British Columbia. Hunting takes place in eastern Hudson\\'s Bay (Nunavik, Quebec), Nunavut and the Beaufort Sea. Researchers have suggested the hunting areas would benefit more from whale watching than hunting since hunting takes more resources than it earns.  In 2018, \\nCanada implemented new restrictions intended to cut human interactions with whales. Following these rules, all boats must stay farther away from the mammals than before. Some activities, including snorkeling with humpbacks, are banned.  \\n\nGreenland has small whale watching operations in Disko Bay  and Nuuk.  Both areas have beluga hunts.  There has been controversy over who is allowed to participate in hunts and consume the meat.  \\n\nEnjoyment of observing live cetaceans is rather separated from the domestic whaling industry in Norway; however, whale watching has become a popular national tourist attraction in recent years, especially in Andfjorden ( Vester\\xc3 5len and Troms ) and around Troms\\xc3\\xb8 .\\n\nErich Hoyt and other conservationists argue that a whale is worth more alive and watched than dead.  The goal is to persuade their governments to curtail whaling activities. This debate continues at the International Whaling Commission , particularly since whaling countries complain that the scarcity of whale meat and other products has increased their value. However, the whale meat market has collapsed, and in Japan the government subsidizes the market through distribution in schools and other promotion. In 1997, 2,000 tonnes of whale meat were sold for $30m - a 10-tonne minke whale would thus have been worth $150,000. There is no agreement as to how to value a single animal although its true value is probably much higher. However, it is clear from most coastal communities that are involved in whale watching that profits can be made and are more horizontally distributed throughout the community than if the animals were killed by the whaling industry.   \\n\nRussian whale watching involves orcas off the Kamchatka peninsula on the edge of the Sea of Okhotsk.  \\n  \\nBeluga are hunted in the Sea of Okhotsk as well as farther north. Erich Hoyt of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has identified other places in Russia to develop whale watching.  \\n\nUpon the resumption of whaling in Iceland in August 2003, pro-whaling groups, such as fishermen who argue that increased stocks of whales deplete fish populations, suggested that sustainable whaling and whale watching could live side by side. Whale watching lobbyists, such as Húsavík Whale Museum curator Asbjorn Bjorgvinsson, counter that the most inquisitive whales, which approach boats very closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, will be the first to be taken. Pro-whaling organisations such as the High North Alliance on the other hand, claim that some whale-watching companies in Iceland are surviving only because they receive funding from anti-whaling organizations. In 2020, Iceland ceased whaling activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and decreasing sales to Japan limited the feasibility of a harvest.   That same year, whaling for minke whales by the only company targeting domestic markets was permanently ended.  A similar decision to halt all whaling activities was made for the summer whaling season of 2021 in light of ongoing pandemic restrictions and steady increases in whale watching tourism.  \\n\nIn comparison, the government of the Azores has promoted an economic policy centred on tourism that includes whale watching. With the decline of whaling in the early 1970s in the islands, many of the communities of the archipelago involved in whaling (including villages and towns, specifically on the islands of Faial , Terceira , S\\xc3 3o Miguel and Pico ) were transformed into hubs for whale watching services (that followed the migratory tracts during the summer), while older buildings and factories were re-purposed into museums.

        "page_content": "Contents\nWorld War II\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\nAsia-Pacific \\n\nMediterranean and Middle East \\n\nOther campaigns \\n\nCoups \\n\nWorld War II [ b ] or the Second World War (1 September 1939 - 2 September 1945) was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers . Nearly all the world\\'s countries \\xe2\\x80\\x94including all the great powers \\xe2\\x80\\x94participated, with many investing all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities in pursuit of total war , blurring the distinction between military and civilian resources. Tanks and aircraft played major roles , with the latter enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70 to 85 million fatalities , more than half of which were civilians. Millions died in genocides , including the Holocaust of European Jews, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. Following the Allied powers\\' victory, Germany , Austria , Japan , and Korea were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders .\\n\nThe causes of World War II included unresolved tensions in the aftermath of World War I and the rises of fascism in Europe and militarism in Japan , and it was preceded by events including the Japanese invasion of Manchuria , Spanish Civil War , outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War , and German annexations of Austria and the Sudetenland . World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany , under Adolf Hitler , invaded Poland . The United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under their Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out \" spheres of influence \" across Eastern Europe; in 1940, the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and parts of Finland and Romania . After the fall of France in June 1940, the war continued primarily between Germany and the British Empire , with campaigns in North and East Africa and the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain and the Blitz of the UK, and the naval Battle of the Atlantic . By mid-1941, through a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany occupied or controlled much of continental Europe and had formed the Axis alliance with Italy , Japan , and other countries. In June 1941, Germany led the European Axis in an invasion of the Soviet Union , opening the Eastern Front .\\n\nJapan aimed to dominate East Asia and the Asia-Pacific , and by 1937 was at war with the Republic of China . In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories in Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific , including an attack on Pearl Harbor , which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the US in solidarity. Japan soon conquered much of the western Pacific , but its advances were halted in 1942 after its defeat in the naval Battle of Midway ; Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943\\xe2\\x80\\x94including German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland , and Allied offensives in the Pacific\\xe2\\x80\\x94cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France at Normandy , while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies westward. In 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands . The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories ; the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; Hitler\\'s suicide ; and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945 . Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration , the US dropped the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago , the possibility of more atomic bombings, and the Soviet declaration of war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria , Japan announced its unconditional surrender on 15 August and signed a surrender document on 2 September 1945 , marking the end of the conflict.\\n\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world, and it set the foundation of international relations for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The United Nations was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powers\\xe2\\x80\\x94China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US\\xe2\\x80\\x94becoming the permanent members of its security council . The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers , setting the stage for the Cold War . In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia . Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion .\\n\nStart and end dates\nWorld War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939   with the German invasion of Poland and the United Kingdom and France \\'s declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937,   or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria , on 19 September 1931.   Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor , who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941.  Other proposed starting dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.  The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939.  Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War II.   \\n\nThe exact date of the war\\'s end also is not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 ( V-J Day ), rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia . A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951.  A 1990 treaty regarding Germany\\'s future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved most post-World War II issues.  No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed,  although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956 , which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.  \\n\nHistory\nWorld War I had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the Central Powers \\xe2\\x80\\x94including Austria-Hungary , Germany , Bulgaria , and the Ottoman Empire \\xe2\\x80\\x94and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia , which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I , such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires.  \\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was established in 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference . The organisation\\'s primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military, and naval disarmament , as well as settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.  \\n\nDespite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I ,  irredentist and revanchist nationalism had emerged in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the Treaty of Versailles . Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions , while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country\\'s armed forces .  \\n\nThe German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918-1919 , and a democratic government, later known as the Weimar Republic , was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian , and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing, and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a \" New Roman Empire \".  \\n\nAdolf Hitler , after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933 when Paul von Hindenburg and the Reichstag appointed him. Following Hindenburg\\'s death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself Führer of Germany and abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order , and soon began a massive rearmament campaign .  France, seeking to secure its alliance with Italy, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia , which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.  \\n\nThe United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards military globalisation ; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany\\'s goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe , drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.  The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year.  \\n\nHitler defied the Versailles and Locarno Treaties by remilitarising the Rhineland in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to the policy of appeasement .  In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Rome-Berlin Axis . A month later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact , which Italy joined the following year.  \\n\nThe Kuomintang (KMT) party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) allies  and new regional warlords . In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan , which had long sought influence in China  as the first step of what its government saw as the country\\'s right to rule Asia , staged the Mukden incident as a pretext to invade Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo .  \\n\nChina appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in Shanghai , Rehe and Hebei , until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria , and Chahar and Suiyuan .  After the 1936 Xi\\'an Incident , the Kuomintang and CCP forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose Japan.  \\n\nThe Second Italo-Ethiopian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia ) by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy ( Regno d\\'Italia ), which was launched from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea .  The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa ( Africa Orientale Italiana , or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did little when the former clearly violated Article X of the League\\'s Covenant .  The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.  Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany\\'s goal of absorbing Austria .  \\n\nWhen civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the Nationalist rebels , led by General Francisco Franco . Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis: Mussolini sent more than 70,000 ground troops, 6,000 aviation personnel, and 720 aircraft to Spain.  The Soviet Union supported the existing government of the Spanish Republic . More than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the International Brigades , also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II but generally favoured the Axis .  His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the Eastern Front .  \\n\nIn July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Peking after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge incident , which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.  The Soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with China to lend materiel support, effectively ending China\\'s prior cooperation with Germany . From September to November, the Japanese attacked Taiyuan , engaged the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou ,  and fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan .   Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai , but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese .   \\n\nIn March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at Taierzhuang , but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by the Japanese in May.  In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River ; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan , but the city was taken by October.  Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.   \\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia . The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron , which emphasised Japan\\'s expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. This policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War  and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-ron , promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States and the Western Allies.   \\n\nIn Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria , again provoking little response from other European powers.  Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland , an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement , which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.  Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary, and Poland annexed the Trans-Olza region of Czechoslovakia.  \\n\nAlthough all of Germany\\'s stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish \"war-mongers\" and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German client state , the Slovak Republic .  Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to Lithuania on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the Klaip\\xc4\\x97da Region , formerly the German Memelland .  \\n\nGreatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City of Danzig , the United Kingdom and France guaranteed their support for Polish independence ; when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to the Kingdoms of Romania and Greece .  Shortly after the Franco - British pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel .  Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to \"encircle\" Germany and renounced the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish declaration of non-aggression .  \\n\nThe situation became a crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany,  after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom, and Soviet Union had stalled.  This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\" (western Poland and Lithuania for Germany; eastern Poland , Finland, Estonia , Latvia and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence.  The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I. Immediately afterwards, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.  \\n\nIn response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which served as a pretext to worsen relations.  On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig , and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German minority would vote on secession.  The Poles refused to comply with the German demands, and on the night of 30-31 August in a confrontational meeting with the British ambassador Nevile Henderson , Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.  \\n\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion.  The first German attack of the war came against the Polish defenses at Westerplatte .  The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany.  During the Phoney War period, the alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a cautious French probe into the Saarland .  The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany , which aimed to damage the country\\'s economy and war effort.  Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic .  \\n\nOn 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of Warsaw . The Polish counter-offensive to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the Wehrmacht . Remnants of the Polish army broke through to besieged Warsaw . On 17 September 1939, two days after signing a cease-fire with Japan , the Soviet Union invaded Poland  under the supposed pretext that the Polish state had ceased to exist.  On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison surrendered to the Germans, and the last large operational unit of the Polish Army surrendered on 6 October . Despite the military defeat, Poland never surrendered; instead, it formed the Polish government-in-exile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied Poland.  A significant part of Polish military personnel evacuated to Romania and Latvia; many of them later fought against the Axis in other theatres of the war.  \\n\nGermany annexed western Poland and occupied central Poland ; the Soviet Union annexed eastern Poland ; small shares of Polish territory were transferred to Lithuania and Slovakia . On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union. The proposal was rejected  and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France,  which was postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather.    \\n\nAfter the outbreak of war in Poland, Stalin threatened Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania with military invasion, forcing the three Baltic countries to sign pacts allowing the creation of Soviet military bases in these countries; in October 1939, significant Soviet military contingents were moved there.    Finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939,  and was subsequently expelled from the League of Nations for this crime of aggression.  Despite overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet military success during the Winter War was modest,  and the Finno-Soviet war ended in March 1940 with some Finnish concessions of territory .  \\n\nIn June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the entire territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,  as well as the Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region . In August 1940, Hitler imposed the Second Vienna Award on Romania which led to the transfer of Northern Transylvania to Hungary.  In September 1940, Bulgaria demanded Southern Dobruja from Romania with German and Italian support, leading to the Treaty of Craiova .  The loss of one-third of Romania\\'s 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II, turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal Ion Antonescu , with a course set towards the Axis in the hopes of a German guarantee.  Meanwhile, German-Soviet political relations and economic co-operation   gradually stalled,   and both states began preparations for war.  \\n\nIn April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments of iron ore from Sweden , which the Allies were attempting to cut off .  Denmark capitulated after six hours , and despite Allied support , Norway was conquered within two months.  British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the resignation of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain , who was replaced by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.  \\n\nOn the same day, Germany launched an offensive against France . To circumvent the strong Maginot Line fortifications on the Franco-German border, Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of Belgium , the Netherlands , and Luxembourg .  The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the Ardennes region,  which was mistakenly perceived by the Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.   By successfully implementing new Blitzkrieg tactics, the Wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the Allied armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille. The United Kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of Allied troops from the continent by early June, although they had to abandon almost all their equipment.  \\n\nOn 10 June, Italy invaded France , declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom.  The Germans turned south against the weakened French army, and Paris fell to them on 14 June. Eight days later France signed an armistice with Germany ; it was divided into German and Italian occupation zones ,  and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime , which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France kept its fleet, which the United Kingdom attacked on 3 July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany.  \\n\nThe air Battle of Britain  began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours .  The German campaign for air superiority started in August but its failure to defeat RAF Fighter Command forced the indefinite postponement of the proposed German invasion of Britain . The German strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on London and other cities in the Blitz , but largely ended in May 1941  after failing to significantly disrupt the British war effort.  \\n\nUsing newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an over-extended Royal Navy , using U-boats against British shipping in the Atlantic .  The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck .  \\n\nIn November 1939, the United States was assisting China and the Western Allies, and had amended the Neutrality Act to allow \"cash and carry\" purchases by the Allies.  In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased . In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases .  Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941.  In December 1940, Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an \" arsenal of democracy \" and promoting Lend-Lease programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the British war effort; Lend-Lease was later extended to the other Allies, including the Soviet Union after it was invaded by Germany.  The United States started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany.  \\n\nAt the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy, and Germany as the Axis powers . The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country\\xe2\\x80\\x94with the exception of the Soviet Union\\xe2\\x80\\x94that attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.  The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary , Slovakia , and Romania joined.  Romania and Hungary later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania\\'s case partially to recapture territory ceded to the Soviet Union .  \\n\nIn early June 1940, the Italian Regia Aeronautica attacked and besieged Malta , a British possession. From late summer to early autumn, Italy conquered British Somaliland and made an incursion into British-held Egypt . In October, Italy attacked Greece , but the attack was repulsed with heavy Italian casualties; the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes.  To assist Italy and prevent Britain from gaining a foothold, Germany prepared to invade the Balkans, which would threaten Romanian oil fields and strike against British dominance of the Mediterranean.  \\n\nIn December 1940, British Empire forces began counter-offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa .  The offensives were successful; by early February 1941, Italy had lost control of eastern Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission after a carrier attack at Taranto , and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan .  \\n\nItalian defeats prompted Germany to deploy an expeditionary force to North Africa; at the end of March 1941, Rommel \\'s Afrika Korps launched an offensive which drove back Commonwealth forces.  In less than a month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and besieged the port of Tobruk .  \\n\nBy late March 1941, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact ; however, the Yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by pro-British nationalists. Germany and Italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both Yugoslavia and Greece , commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month.  The airborne invasion of the Greek island of Crete at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans.  Partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia , which continued until the end of the war.  \\n\nIn the Middle East in May, Commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria .  Between June and July, British-led forces invaded and occupied the French possessions of Syria and Lebanon , assisted by the Free French .  \\n\nWith the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations for war. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany, and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia , the two powers signed the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.  By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.  \\n\nHitler believed that the United Kingdom\\'s refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.  On 31 July 1940, Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of Ukraine , the Baltic states and Byelorussia .  However, other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a Euro-Asian bloc against the British Empire by inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact.  In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the pact. The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.  \\n\nOn 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa , with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them ; they were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.  The primary targets of this surprise offensive  were the Baltic region , Moscow and Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line \\xe2\\x80\\x94from the Caspian to the White Seas . Hitler\\'s objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism , generate Lebensraum (\"living space\")  by dispossessing the native population ,  and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany\\'s remaining rivals.  \\n\nAlthough the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war,  Operation Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt strategic defence . During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By mid-August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre , and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.  The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially-developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov ).  \\n\nThe diversion of three-quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front  prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy .  In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany  and in August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter , which outlined British and American goals for the post-war world.  In late August the British and Soviets invaded neutral Iran to secure the Persian Corridor , Iran\\'s oil fields , and preempt any Axis advances through Iran toward the Baku oil fields or India.  \\n\nBy October, Axis powers had achieved operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region, with only the sieges of Leningrad  and Sevastopol continuing.  A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops  were forced to suspend the offensive.  Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended.  \\n\nBy early December, freshly mobilised reserves  allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.  This, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army ,  allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100-250 kilometres (62-155 mi) west.  \\n\nFollowing the Japanese false flag Mukden incident in 1931, the Japanese shelling of the American gunboat USS Panay in 1937, and the 1937-1938 Nanjing Massacre , Japanese-American relations deteriorated . In 1939, the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Export Control Acts \\xe2\\x80\\x94which banned U.S. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan, and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime.    During 1939 Japan launched its first attack against Changsha , but was repulsed by late September.  Despite several offensives by both sides, by 1940 the war between China and Japan was at a stalemate. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina in September 1940.  \\n\nChinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940. In August, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China ; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.  Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941 , effectively ending their co-operation.  In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during Battle of Shanggao .  In September, Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.  \\n\nGerman successes in Europe prompted Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia . The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan with oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies , but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.  In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo.   At the same time, Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East , intending to take advantage of the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.  \\n\nSince early 1941, the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.  At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.  Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any \"neighboring countries\".  \\n\nFrustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. Emperor Hirohito , after initial hesitation about Japan\\'s chances of victory,  began to favour Japan\\'s entry into the war.  As a result, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned.   Hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni in his place, choosing War Minister Hideki Tojo instead.  On 3 November, Nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on Pearl Harbor to the Emperor.  On 5 November, Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war.  On 20 November, the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange, Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.  The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.  That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;   the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.  \\n\nJapan planned to seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.   To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.  On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific .  These included an attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines , as well as invasions of Guam , Wake Island , Malaya ,  Thailand , and Hong Kong .  \\n\nThese attacks led the United States , United Kingdom , China, Australia, and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.  Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States  in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.   \\n\nOn 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four  \\xe2\\x80\\x94the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x94and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations , thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter  and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the Axis powers.  \\n\nDuring 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets demanded a second front. The British argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolstering resistance forces; Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour, without using large-scale armies.  Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.  \\n\nAt the Casablanca Conference in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.  Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland, and to invade France in 1944.  \\n\nBy the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost conquered Burma , Malaya , the Dutch East Indies , Singapore , and Rabaul , inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.  Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and U.S. forces , the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.  On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.  Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea , Java Sea , and Indian Ocean ,  and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin , Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha .  These easy victories over the unprepared U.S. and European opponents left Japan overconfident, and overextended.  \\n\nIn early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea .  Japan\\'s next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid , was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.  In mid-May, Japan started the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.   In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans had broken Japanese naval codes in late May and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy .  \\n\nWith its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan attempted to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua .  The Americans planned a counterattack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands , primarily Guadalcanal , as a first step towards capturing Rabaul , the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.  \\n\nBoth plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island , where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna-Gona .  Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops .  In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first was a disastrous offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942 that forced a retreat back to India by May 1943.  The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese frontlines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.  \\n\nDespite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia , keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.  In May, the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov ,  and then in June 1942 launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy the Kuban steppe , while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River . The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.  \\n\nBy mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting . The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad ,  and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow , though the latter failed disastrously.  By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated,  and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov , creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk .  \\n\nExploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast .  By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive in North Africa, Operation Crusader , and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made.  The Germans also launched a North African offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala line by early February,  followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives.  Concerns that the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942.  An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein .  On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the failed Dieppe Raid ,  demonstrated the Western Allies\\' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.  \\n\nIn August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein  and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta .  A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya.  This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa , which resulted in the region joining the Allies.  Hitler responded to the French colony\\'s defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France ;  although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces.   Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia , which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943.   \\n\nIn June 1943, the British and Americans began a strategic bombing campaign against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and \" de-house \" the civilian population.  The firebombing of Hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.  \\n\nAfter the Guadalcanal campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians .  Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands , and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands .  By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands . In April, the Allies launched an operation to retake Western New Guinea .  \\n\nIn the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia . On 5 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge . Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets\\' well-constructed defences,  and for the first time in the war, Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.  This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies\\' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month.  \\n\nOn 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives , thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,  giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.   The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther-Wotan line , but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and the Lower Dnieper Offensive .  \\n\nOn 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland , following Italy\\'s armistice with the Allies and the ensuing German occupation of Italy.  Germany, with the help of fascists, responded to the armistice by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,  and creating a series of defensive lines.  German special forces then rescued Mussolini , who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic ,  causing an Italian civil war . The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.  \\n\nGerman operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective , the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign.  In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran .  The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory  and the military planning for the Burma campaign ,  while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany\\'s defeat.  \\n\nFrom November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde , the Chinese awaited allied relief as they forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition.    In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio .  \\n\nOn 27 January 1944, Soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled German forces from the Leningrad region , thereby ending the most lethal siege in history .  The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence . This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region.  By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea , largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine , and made incursions into Romania , which were repulsed by the Axis troops.  The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, Rome was captured on 4 June.  \\n\nThe Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against Allied positions in Assam, India ,  and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima .  In May 1944, British and Indian forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July,  and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina .  The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China\\'s main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.  By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha .  \\n\nOn 6 June 1944 (commonly known as D-Day ), after three years of Soviet pressure,  the Western Allies invaded northern France . After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France .  These landings were successful and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France . Paris was liberated on 25 August by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces , both led by General Charles de Gaulle ,  and the Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe during the latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed.  After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross the Rur river . In Italy, the Allied advance slowed due to the last major German defensive line .  \\n\nOn 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus (\" Operation Bagration \") that nearly destroyed the German Army Group Centre .  Soon after that, another Soviet strategic offensive forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviets formed the Polish Committee of National Liberation to control territory in Poland and combat the Polish Armia Krajowa ; the Soviet Red Army remained in the Praga district on the other side of the Vistula and watched passively as the Germans quelled the Warsaw Uprising initiated by the Armia Krajowa.  The national uprising in Slovakia was also quelled by the Germans.  The Soviet Red Army \\'s strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful coup d\\'état in Romania and in Bulgaria , followed by those countries\\' shift to the Allied side.  \\n\nIn September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece , Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.  By this point, the communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito , who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern Serbia , the Soviet Red Army , with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945.  Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions,  although Finland was forced to fight their former German allies .  \\n\nBy the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam , pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River  while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In September 1944, Chinese forces captured Mount Song and reopened the Burma Road .  In China, the Japanese had more successes, having finally captured Changsha in mid-June and the city of Hengyang by early August.  Soon after, they invaded the province of Guangxi , winning major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the end of November  and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by mid-December.  \\n\nIn the Pacific, U.S. forces continued to push back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea . These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo , and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte ; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf , one of the largest naval battles in history.  \\n\nOn 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt to split the Allies on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French-German border , hoping to encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port at Antwerp . By 16 January 1945, this offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.  In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Red Army attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia .  On 4 February Soviet, British, and U.S. leaders met for the Yalta Conference . They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan.  \\n\nIn February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania , while the Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr , encircling the German Army Group B .  In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and retake Budapest, Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet troops near Lake Balaton . Within two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to Vienna , and captured the city. In early April, Soviet troops captured K\\xc3\\xb6nigsberg , while the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg . American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April, leaving unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin.\\n\nSoviet troops stormed and captured Berlin in late April.  In Italy, German forces surrendered on 29 April, while the Italian Social Republic capitulated two days later. On 30 April, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.  \\n\nMajor changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period. On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice president, Harry S. Truman . Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.  On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in his headquarters , and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl D\\xc3\\xb6nitz (as President of the Reich ) and Joseph Goebbels (as Chancellor of the Reich ); Goebbels also committed suicide on the following day and was replaced by Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk , in what would later be known as the Flensburg Government . Total and unconditional surrender in Europe was signed on 7 and 8 May , to be effective by the end of 8 May .  German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May.  On 23 May all remaining members of the German government were arrested by the Allied Forces in Flensburg , while on 5 June all German political and military institutions were transferred under the control of the Allies through the Berlin Declaration .  \\n\nIn the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of the Philippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines , clearing Leyte by the end of April 1945. They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and recaptured Manila in March. Fighting continued on Luzon, Mindanao , and other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war .  Meanwhile, the United States Army Air Forces launched a massive firebombing campaign of strategic cities in Japan in an effort to destroy Japanese war industry and civilian morale. A devastating bombing raid on Tokyo of 9-10 March was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history.  \\n\nIn May 1945, Australian troops landed in Borneo , overrunning the oilfields there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March, and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May.  Chinese forces started a counterattack in the Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa by the end of June.  At the same time, a naval blockade by submarines was strangling Japan\\'s economy and drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces.   \\n\nOn 11 July, Allied leaders met in Potsdam, Germany . They confirmed earlier agreements about Germany,  and the American, British and Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of Japan, specifically stating that \" the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction \".  During this conference, the United Kingdom held its general election , and Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as Prime Minister.  \\n\nThe call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the Japanese government, which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms.  In early August, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, declared war on Japan , invaded Japanese-held Manchuria and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army , which was the largest Japanese fighting force.  These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms.  The Red Army also captured the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands . On the night of 9-10 August 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced his decision to accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the Potsdam Declaration .  On 15 August, the Emperor communicated this decision to the Japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio ( Gyokuon-h\\xc5\\x8ds\\xc5\\x8d , literally \"broadcast in the Emperor\\'s voice\").  On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered , with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay on the deck of the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.  \\n\nAftermath\nThe Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and Germany , both initially divided between western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, respectively. However, their paths soon diverged. In Germany, the western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union officially ended in 1949, with the respective zones becoming separate countries, West Germany and East Germany .  In Austria, however, occupation continued until 1955, when a joint settlement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union permitted the reunification of Austria as a democratic state officially non-aligned with any political bloc (although in practice having better relations with the Western Allies). A denazification program in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the Nuremberg trials and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.  \\n\nGermany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern territories, Silesia , Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland,  and East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, followed by the expulsion to Germany of the nine million Germans from these provinces,   as well as three million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon Line ,  from which 2 million Poles were expelled ;   north-east Romania,   parts of eastern Finland,  and the Baltic states were annexed into the Soviet Union .   Italy lost its monarchy , colonial empire and some European territories .  \\n\nIn an effort to maintain world peace ,  the Allies formed the United Nations ,  which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,  and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations .  The great powers that were the victors of the war\\xe2\\x80\\x94France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x94became the permanent members of the UN\\'s Security Council .  The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the Republic of China and the People\\'s Republic of China in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state , the Russian Federation , following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.  \\n\nBesides Germany, the rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence .  Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere , which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany ,  Poland , Hungary , Romania , Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , and Albania  became Soviet satellite states . Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy , causing tension with the Soviet Union .  A Communist uprising in Greece was put down with Anglo-American support and the country remained aligned with the West.  \\n\nPost-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact .  The long period of political tensions and military competition between them\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Cold War \\xe2\\x80\\x94would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the world.  \\n\nIn Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administered Japan\\'s former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands .  Korea , formerly under Japanese colonial rule , was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the United States in the South between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the Korean War .  \\n\nIn China, nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People\\'s Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949.  In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict . While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires , their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation .   \\n\nThe global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom , and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.  The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany from 1945 to 1948.  Due to international trade interdependencies, this policy led to an economic stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for several years.   \\n\nAt the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944, the Allied nations drew up an economic framework for the post-war world. The agreement created the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which later became part of the World Bank Group . The Bretton Woods system lasted until 1973.  Recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in Western Germany , and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the U.S. Marshall Plan economic aid (1948-1951) both directly and indirectly caused.   The post-1948 West German recovery has been called the German economic miracle .  Italy also experienced an economic boom  and the French economy rebounded .  By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin,  and although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country,  it continued in relative economic decline for decades.  The Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era,  having seized and transferred most of Germany\\'s industrial plants and exacted war reparations from its satellite states. [ c ]  Japan recovered much later.  China returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952.  \\n\nImpact\nEstimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded.  Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.    \\n\nThe Soviet Union alone lost around 27 million people during the war,  including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths.  A quarter of the total people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed.  Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.  \\n\nAn estimated 11  to 17 million  civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of Hitler\\'s racist policies , including mass killing of around 6 million Jews , along with Roma , homosexuals , at least 1.9 million ethnic Poles   and millions of other Slavs (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), and other ethnic and minority groups .   Between 1941 and 1945, more than 200,000 ethnic Serbs , along with Roma and Jews, were persecuted and murdered by the Axis-aligned Croatian Usta\\xc5 1e in Yugoslavia .  Concurrently, Muslims and Croats were persecuted and killed by Serb nationalist Chetniks ,  with an estimated 50,000-68,000 victims (of which 41,000 were civilians).  Also, more than 100,000 Poles were massacred by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the Volhynia massacres , between 1943 and 1945.  At the same time, about 10,000-15,000 Ukrainians were killed by the Polish Home Army and other Polish units, in reprisal attacks.  \\n\nIn Asia and the Pacific, the number of people killed by Japanese troops remains contested. According to R.J. Rummel, the Japanese killed between 3 million and more than 10 million people, with the most probable case of almost 6,000,000 people.  According to the British historian M. R. D. Foot , civilian deaths are between 10 million and 20 million, whereas Chinese military casualties (killed and wounded) are estimated to be over five million.  Other estimates say that up to 30 million people, most of them civilians, were killed.   The most infamous Japanese atrocity was the Nanjing Massacre , in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered.  Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the Three Alls policy . General Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Hebei and Shandong .  \\n\nAxis forces employed biological and chemical weapons . The Imperial Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of China ( see Unit 731 )   and in early conflicts against the Soviets .  Both the Germans and the Japanese tested such weapons against civilians,  and sometimes on prisoners of war .  \\n\nThe Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish officers,  and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD secret police, along with mass civilian deportations to Siberia , in the Baltic states and eastern Poland annexed by the Red Army.  Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially in Germany .   The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million,  while figures for women raped by German soldiers in the Soviet Union go as far as ten million.   \\n\nThe mass bombing of cities in Europe and Asia has often been called a war crime, although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during World War II.  The USAAF bombed a total of 67 Japanese cities , killing 393,000 civilians, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and destroying 65% of built-up areas.  \\n\nNazi Germany , under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, was responsible for murdering about 6 million Jews in what is now known as the Holocaust . They also murdered an additional 4 million others who were deemed \" unworthy of life \" (including the disabled and mentally ill , Soviet prisoners of war , Romani , homosexuals , Freemasons , and Jehovah\\'s Witnesses ) as part of a program of deliberate extermination, in effect becoming a \" genocidal state\".  Soviet POWs were kept in especially unbearable conditions, and 3.6 million Soviet POWs out of 5.7 million died in Nazi camps during the war.   In addition to concentration camps , death camps were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale. Nazi Germany extensively used forced labourers ; about 12 million Europeans from German-occupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German industry, agriculture and war economy.  \\n\nThe Soviet Gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during 1942-43, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates,  including foreign citizens of Poland and other countries occupied in 1939-40 by the Soviet Union, as well as Axis POWs .  By the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to NKVD evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators.  \\n\nJapanese prisoner-of-war camps , many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 percent (for American POWs, 37 percent),  seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians.  While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan , the number of Chinese released was only 56.  \\n\nAt least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board , or K\\xc5\\x8dain , for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million.  In Java , between 4 and 10 million r\\xc5\\x8dmusha (Japanese: \"manual labourers\"), were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in Southeast Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.  \\n\nIn Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia ) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks (27.8 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.  Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.  \\n\nIn the East, the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders.  Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the \" inferior people \" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes .  The Nazis killed an estimated 2.77 million ethnic Poles during the war in addition to Polish-Jewish victims of the Holocaust.  [ better source needed ] Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East  or the West  until late 1943.\\n\nIn Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere , essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.  Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination, Japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them.  During Japan\\'s initial conquest, it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m 3 ) of oil (~550,000 tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces; and by 1943, was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (7,900,000 m 3 ) of oil (~6.8 million tonnes), 76 percent of its 1940 output rate.  \\n\nIn the 1930s Britain and the United States of America together controlled almost 75% of world mineral output\\xe2\\x80\\x94essential for projecting military power.  \\n\nIn Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); including colonies, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.  In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this reduces to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.  \\n\nThe United States produced about two-thirds of all munitions used by the Allies in World War II, including warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.  Although the Allies\\' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies and the war evolved into one of attrition .  While the Allies\\' ability to out-produce the Axis was partly due to more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan\\'s reluctance to employ women in the labour force ,  Allied strategic bombing ,  and Germany\\'s late shift to a war economy  contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so.  To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers ;  Germany enslaved about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe,  while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.   \\n\nAircraft were used for reconnaissance , as fighters , bombers , and ground-support , and each role developed considerably. Innovations included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);  and strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy\\'s ability to wage war).  Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze . The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.  \\n\nAdvances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare , most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines . Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto , Pearl Harbor , and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship (in place of the battleship).    In the Atlantic, escort carriers became a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap .  Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft  and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured.  Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War ,  were expected by all combatants to be important in the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics.  [ better source needed ] Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh Light , Hedgehog , Squid , and homing torpedoes proved effective against German submarines.  \\n\nLand warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry , to increased mobility and combined arms . The tank , which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.  In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,  and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.   At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.  This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany\\'s use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.  Many means of destroying tanks , including indirect artillery , anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled ), mines , short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used.  Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,  and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I.  The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German MG 34 , and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings.  The assault rifle , a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard post-war infantry weapon for most armed forces.  \\n\nMost major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well-known being the German Enigma machine .  Development of SIGINT ( sig nals int elligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes  and British Ultra , a pioneering method for decoding Enigma that benefited from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau , which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war.  Another component of military intelligence was deception , which the Allies used to great effect in operations such as Mincemeat and Bodyguard .   \\n\nOther technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world\\'s first programmable computers ( Z3 , Colossus , and ENIAC ), guided missiles and modern rockets , the Manhattan Project \\'s development of nuclear weapons , operations research , the development of artificial harbours , and oil pipelines under the English Channel .  Penicillin was first developed, mass-produced, and used during the war.  \\n\nSee also\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\nExternal links"

        "page_content": "Contents\nPonce Historic Zone\n\\n\nThe Ponce Historic Zone  is a historic district in downtown Ponce, Puerto Rico , consisting of buildings, plazas and structures with distinctive architectures such as Neoclásico Isabelino and the Ponce Creole , a local architectural style developed between the 19th- and early 20th-centuries.  The zone goes by various names, including Traditional Ponce ( Ponce Tradicional ),  Central Ponce ( Ponce Centro ),  Historic Ponce ( Ponce Histórico ),  and Ponce Historic District ( Distrito Histórico de Ponce ).  Although not yet listed in the National Register of Historic Places , the Ponce Historic Zone was added to the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones ( Registro Nacional de Sitios y Zonas Históricas ) on February 2, 1989.  \\n\nLocation\nThe historic zone is located in what is commonly called Ponce Pueblo - the central downtown and oldest area of the city. While there are several roads that lead to it, the most common point of entry is via PR-1 , which becomes the Miguel Pou Boulevard, and then into the one-way Isabel Street, leading to the center of Ponce at the Plaza Las Delicias .  \\n\nIn addition to Plaza Las Delicias, with its unique Parque de Bombas and Nuestra Señora de la Guadalupe Cathedral , the zone includes landmarks such as Ponce City Hall , Armstrong-Poventud Residence , Ponce High School , and Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro . Numerous other attractions in this historic area are listed in the NRHP , such as Banco de Ponce , Casa Paoli , and Casa de la Masacre .  Others, such as Teatro Fox Delicias , Teatro La Perla , Plaza de Mercado , Hotel Meliá , and Paseo Atocha are not listed but possess significant historical value.  Street corners in most of this zone have chamfered corners , typical of Barcelona, Spain .\\n\nA map of the area covered by the Ponce Historic Zone is available (in 2011) from the government of the municipality of Ponce.  \\n\nHistory\nCarmelo Rosario Natal has linked the origins of the Ponce Historic Zone to an event that took place on 8 June 1893. On that date, La Gaceta de Puerto Rico, the insular government\\'s official periodical, published an edict of the Governor of Puerto Rico, Antonio Daban y Ramirez de Arellano, that mandated municipal authorities throughout the Island to divide, for fire control purposes, a town\\'s urban center into three zones: stone-built, build with fire resistant materials, and built with combustible materials. No structure could be built, rebuilt or restored within a minimum of 50 meters from the town\\'s central square unless it was stoned-built or it was to be upgraded to a stone-built structure.  According to Rosario Natal, those were the roots of what almost 70 years later would be called the Ponce Historic Zone.\\n\nOn 20 June 1960, governor Luis Muñoz Marín amended the law regarding historic zones, making it possible for Ponce to be included in such category.  On 6 June 1962, the Zone was officially designated as such, and initially included only the center core of the city, but it was later expanded to include a much larger area.  On that date (6 June 1962) the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña , with the concurrence of the Puerto Rico Planning Board , approved a resolution creating the Zone. The Zone included a list of 22, mostly contiguous areas, including specific buildings, structures, plaza, streets and sectors that were to be preserved. It also included an area in barrio Playa , including the ruins of the old Fuerte de San José .  \\n\nIt was not long before the creation of the Zone was opposed by local developers and the real estate service industry. Ismaro Torruella, president of the Municipal Assembly, who was originally one of the supporters of the creation of the Zone, succumbed to mounting pressure from local developers, business people and realtors and, by 1962, now favored the elimination, or at least the limitation, of the Zone. \"The evidence on this matter is clear. Torruella and his colleagues wanted to make sure the public hearing [of 10 March 1965] was controlled by them.\"  Opposing groups sought to make their voices known to the townspeople at large, not just to the Municipal Government and the ICP , and formed \"Comite de Ciudadanos para el Progreso de Ponce\" (Citizens Committee Ponce\\'s Progress). This committee included prominent businessmen such as Juan Eugenio Candal , Jose Maria Rovira , Gustavo Armstrong , Jose Moscoso , Tito Castro , among several others. To counter this group, supporters of the Historic Zone created their own \"Comite Ponceño Pro Buen Progreso\" (Ponce Citizens\\' Committee for Fair Progress).\" The debates went on for years with many public hearings taking place. Professional urban planning, traffic, and architectural studies, among others, also took place and recommendations were provided. One study categorized the architectural styles in the Historic Zone into seven groups: Neoclassical European , Spanish Colonial , Ponce Creole , Criollo Pueblerino , Criollo Residencial Pueblerino , Neoclassical Creole , and Neoclassical Superior .  \\n\nOn 17 November 2005, then-Governor of Puerto Rico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá , signed Executive Order Number 72, approving the historic Ponce center as a Historic Center of First Order.  \\n\nPlan Ponce en Marcha\nIn the 1990s an intensive $440 million   revitalization project called \" Plan Ponce en Marcha \"  (\"Ponce on the Move Plan\") has increased the city\\'s historic area from 260 to 1,046 buildings.  The Ponce en Marcha project was conceived in 1985 by then governor Rafael Hernández Colón during his second term in La Fortaleza . A significant number of buildings in Ponce are listed in the National Register of Historic Places .  The nonprofit Project for Public Places  listed the historic downtown Ponce city center as one of the 60 of the World\\'s Great Places , for its \"graciously preserved showcase of Caribbean culture\".  The Ponce en Marcha project has given even more form to the definition, establishment, and development of the Ponce Historic Zone. The plan is the result of litigation between the Government of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce and the Government of Puerto Rico.  \\n\nThe Ponce en Marcha plan projects involve several departments of the Government of Puerto Rico:   \\n\nStructures within the historic zone are classified into four categories:  \\n\nThe historic zone itself consists of three distinct sub-zones:  \\n\nIn August 2003, Mayor Cordero favored a measure to exclude Belgica, Claussells, and Cantera \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all poor, low-income communities \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from the historic zone.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n"
