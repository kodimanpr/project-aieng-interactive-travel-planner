Its population in 2010 was 3,875.     \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nAs was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.   \\n\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nLocated across the central plaza in Loíza barrio-pueblo is the Parroquia Espíritu Santo y San Patricio , a Roman Catholic church.  \\n\nHistory\nLoíza barrio-pueblo was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Pueblo was 833.  \\n \\n\nSectors\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English).
