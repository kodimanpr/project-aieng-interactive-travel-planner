    "main_content": "Contents\nPuerto Rico\n\\n\n\\n\nPuerto Rico [ i ] ( Spanish for 'rich port'; abbreviated PR ),  officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , [ b ] [ j ] is a self-governing Caribbean archipelago and island organized as an unincorporated territory of the United States under the designation of commonwealth . Located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami , Florida , between the Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Lesser Antilles , it consists of the eponymous main island and numerous smaller islands, including Vieques , Culebra , and Mona . With approximately 3.2 million residents , it is divided into 78 municipalities , of which the most populous is the capital municipality of San Juan .  Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government ,  though Spanish predominates.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was settled by a succession of peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago;  these included the Ortoiroid , Saladoid , and Taíno . It was claimed by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 and colonization by Juan Ponce de León in 1508.  Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries. An influx of African slaves and Spaniard settlers, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the island. Within the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain .   By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of indigenous , African , and European elements.   In 1898, following the Spanish-American War , Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States .   \\n\nPuerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, and can move freely between the island and the mainland .  However, Puerto Ricans who do not reside in a U.S. state are disenfranchised from federal elections  and generally do not pay federal income tax .   [ k ] In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico sends a nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress , called a Resident Commissioner , and participates in presidential primaries ; as it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress , which governs it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 . Congress approved a local constitution in 1952, allowing U.S. citizens residing on the island to elect a governor . Puerto Rico\\'s current and future political status has consistently been a matter of significant debate.   \\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, the U.S. government , together with the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company , launched a series of economic projects to develop Puerto Rico into an industrial high-income economy. It is classified by the International Monetary Fund as a developed jurisdiction with an advanced, high-income economy ;  it ranks 40th on the Human Development Index . The major sectors of Puerto Rico\\'s economy are manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals , petrochemicals , and electronics) followed by services (namely tourism and hospitality).  \\n\nEtymology\nPuerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port\".  Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen , a derivation of Borikén , its indigenous Taíno name, which is popularly said to mean \"Land of the Valiant Lord\".    The terms boricua , borinqueño , and borincano are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage,   and derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively.  The island is also popularly known in Spanish as La Isla del Encanto , meaning \"the island of enchantment\".  \\n\nColumbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of Saint John the Baptist , while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico (\"Rich Port City\").  Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city. [ l ] \\n\nThe island\\'s name was changed to Porto Rico by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 .  The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises (also Porto in Italian, French, and Portuguese). The name was changed back to Puerto Rico in 1931 by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila .  [ m ]    \\n\nThe official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\"), while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico .  \\n\nHistory\nThe history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC. At the time of Christopher Columbus \\'s arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Taínos . The Taíno people\\'s numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare.  \\n\nLocated in the northeastern Caribbean, Puerto Rico formed a key part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World . The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.\\n\nIn 1593, Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names. The smallest of the Greater Antilles , Puerto Rico was a stepping-stone in the passage from Europe to Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the northern territories of South America. Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the Spanish-American War , Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World; they served as Spain\\'s final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents. Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 . The decree was printed in Spanish, English and French in order to attract Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers. Free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church .  \\n\nIn 1898, during the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S.\\n\nThe Foraker Act of 1900 established a civil government, ending rule by American generals and the Department of War .  A U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Ortega v. Lara , 202 U.S. 339, 342 (1906), [ n ] involving the Foraker Act and referring to the island as \"the acquired country\", soon affirmed that the U.S. Constitution applied within its territory and that any domestic Puerto Rican laws which did not conflict with it remained in force.  \\n\nThe Jones Act of 1917, which made Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens , paved the way for the drafting of Puerto Rico\\'s Constitution and its approval by Congress and Puerto Rican voters in 1952. However, the political status of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth controlled by the U.S., remains an anomaly.\\n\nIn 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the U.S. government to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.  In November 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with the general elections.   The first question, voted on in August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution. 54% voted against the status quo, effectively approving the second question to be voted on in November. The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association .  61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and 5.49% for independence.  [ failed verification ] \\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 5278: PROMESA , establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rican government. This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations. In particular, the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government\\'s constitutional power to \"make all needful rules and regulations\" regarding U.S. territories; The president would appoint all seven voting members of the board; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico\\'s legislature, governor, and other public authorities.  \\n\nPuerto Rico held its statehood referendum during the 3 November 2020 general elections; the ballot asked one question: \"Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State ?\" The results showed that 52 percent of Puerto Rico voters answered yes.  \\n\nGeography\nPuerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands, including Vieques , Culebra , Mona , Desecheo , and Caja de Muertos . Of these five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round. Mona, which has played a key role in maritime history, is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources .  There are many other even smaller islets , like Monito , located near Mona,  and Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan , both located on the San Juan Bay . The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra , which are connected to the main island by bridges.   \\n\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 5,320 square miles (13,800 km 2 ), of which 3,420 sq mi (8,900 km 2 ) is land and 1,900 sq mi (4,900 km 2 ) is water.  Puerto Rico is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island but smaller than Connecticut . The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 110 mi (180 km), and the maximum width from north to south is 40 mi (64 km).  Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles . It is 80% of the size of Jamaica ,  just over 18% of the size of Hispaniola and 8% of the size of Cuba, the largest of the Greater Antilles.  \\n\n\\nThe topography of the island is mostly mountainous with large flat areas in the northern and southern coasts. The main mountain range that crosses the island from east to west is called the Cordillera Central (also known as the Central Mountain Range in English). The highest elevation in Puerto Rico, Cerro de Punta 4,390 feet (1,340 m),  is located in this range. Another important peak is El Yunque , one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest , with an elevation of 3,494 ft (1,065 m). \nPuerto Rico has 17 lakes, all man-made, and more than 50 rivers , most of which originate in the Cordillera Central.  Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south, since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions.\\n\nPuerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks, overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks .  Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old ( Jurassic ) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm.\\n\nPuerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American Plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis . These seismic events, along with landslides , represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The 1918 San Fermín earthquake occurred on 11 October , 1918 and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale .  It originated off the coast of Aguadilla , several kilometers off the northern coast, and was accompanied by a tsunami . It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses, damaging infrastructure, especially bridges. It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4 million in property damage. The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party . On 7 January 2020,  the country experienced its largest earthquake since 1918,  estimated at magnitude 6.4.  Economic losses were estimated to be more than $3.1 billion.  \\n\nThe Puerto Rico Trench , the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic, is located about 71 mi (114 km) north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates.  It is 170 mi (270 km) long.  At its deepest point, named the Milwaukee Deep , it is almost 27,600 ft (8,400 m) deep.  The Mona Canyon , located in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, is another prominent oceanic landform with steep walls measuring between 1.25 and 2.17 miles (2.01 and 3.49 km) in height from bottom to top.  \\n\nThe climate of Puerto Rico in the K\\xc3\\xb6ppen climate classification is mostly tropical rainforest . Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near 85 °F (29 °C) in lower elevations and 70 °F (21 °C) in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season , which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March. The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances. The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects, adding to the climatic variation. Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas.\\n\nBetween the dry and wet seasons, there is a temperature change of around 6 °F (3.3 °C). This change is due mainly to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean , which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal water temperatures during the year are about 75 °F (24 °C) in February and 85 °F (29 °C) in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was 110 °F (43 °C) at Arecibo ,  while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40 °F (4 °C) in the mountains at Adjuntas , Aibonito , and Corozal .  The average yearly precipitation is 66 in (1,676 mm).  \\n\nPuerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season , similar to the rest of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean. On average, a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones , which are more prevalent during periods of La Niña than El Niño .  A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico, on average, every five years. A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island, on average, every seven years. Since 1851, the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane (also known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane in Puerto Rico) of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane.  \\n\nIn the busy 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Puerto Rico avoided a direct hit by the Category 5 Hurricane Irma on 6 September 2017, as it passed about 60 mi (97 km) north of Puerto Rico, but high winds caused a loss of electrical power to some one million residents. Almost 50% of hospitals were operating with power provided by generators.  The Category 4 Hurricane Jose , as expected, veered away from Puerto Rico.  A short time later, the devastating Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday, 20 September, near the Yabucoa municipality at 10:15 UTC (6:15 am local time) as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 155 mph (249 km/h), powerful rains and widespread flooding causing tremendous destruction, including the electrical grid, which would remain out for 4-6 months in many portions of the island.    \\n\nIn 2019, Hurricane Dorian became the third hurricane in three years to hit Puerto Rico. The recovering infrastructure from the 2017 hurricanes, as well as new governor Wanda Vázquez Garced , were put to the test against a potential humanitarian crisis.   Tropical Storm Karen also caused impacts to Puerto Rico during 2019.  \\n\nClimate change has had large impacts on the ecosystems and landscapes of the US territory Puerto Rico. According to a 2019 report by Germanwatch , Puerto Rico is the most affected by climate change. The territory\\'s energy consumption is mainly derived from imported fossil fuels .   \\n\nThe Puerto Rico Climate Change Council (PRCCC) noted severe changes in seven categories: air temperature, precipitation, extreme weather events, tropical storms and hurricanes, ocean acidification , sea surface temperatures, and sea level rise .  \\n\nClimate change also affects Puerto Rico\\'s population, the economy, human health, and the number of people forced to migrate.\\n\nPuerto Rico is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Puerto Rican moist forests , Puerto Rican dry forests , and Greater Antilles mangroves .  Puerto Rico has two biosphere reserves recognized by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme : Luquillo Biosphere Reserve represented by El Yunque National Forest and the Guánica Biosphere Reserve .\\n\nSpecies endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 amphibians / reptiles , recognized as of 1998. Most of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island.  The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí , a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, from which it gets its name. Most coquí species (13 of 17) live in the El Yunque National Forest ,  the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. Forest Service system, located in the northeast of the island. It was previously known as the Caribbean National Forest. El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic to the island. It is also home to 50 bird species, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon .\\n\nIn addition to El Yunque National Forest, the Puerto Rican moist forest ecoregion is represented by protected areas such as the Maricao and Toro Negro state forests . These areas are home to endangered endemic species such as the Puerto Rican boa ( Chilabothrus inornatus ), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk ( Accipiter striatus venator ), the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk ( Buteo platypterus brunnescens ) and the elfin woods warbler ( Setophaga angelae ). The Northern Karst country of Puerto Rico is also home to one of the remaining rainforest tracts in the island, with the Río Abajo State Forest being the first focus for the reintroduction of the highly endangered Puerto Rican parrot outside of the Sierra de Luquillo.   \\n\nIn the southwest, the Guánica State Forest and Biosphere Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals, including 48 endangered species and 16 that are endemic to Puerto Rico, and is considered a prime example of the Puerto Rican dry forest ecoregion and the best-preserved dry forest in the Caribbean.  Other protected dry forests in Puerto Rico can be formed within the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge complex at the Cabo Rojo , Desecheo , Culebra and Vieques National Wildlife Refuges , and in the Caja de Muertos and Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserves .  Examples of endemic species found in this ecoregion are the higo chumbo ( Harrisia portoricensis ), the Puerto Rican crested toad ( Peltophryne lemur ), and the Mona ground iguana ( Cyclura stejnegeri ), the largest land animal native to Puerto Rico.  \\n\nPuerto Rico has three of the seven year-long bioluminescent bays in the Caribbean: Laguna Grande in Fajardo , La Parguera in Lajas and Puerto Mosquito in Vieques . These are unique bodies of water surrounded by mangroves that are inhabited by the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense .   However, tourism, pollution, and hurricanes have highly threatened these unique ecosystems.  \\n\nGovernment and politics\nPuerto Rico has a republican form of government based on the American model , with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States.   All governmental powers are delegated by the United States Congress , with the head of state being the president of the United States . As an unincorporated territory , Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S. Constitution.  \\n\nThe government of Puerto Rico is composed of three branches. The executive is headed by the governor , currently Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia . The legislative branch consists of the bicameral Legislative Assembly , made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber; the Senate is headed by a president , currently José Luis Dalmau , while the House is headed by the speaker of the House , currently Tatito Hernández . The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years, with the last election held in November 2020 . The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , currently Maite Oronoz Rodríguez . Members of the judiciary are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.\\n\nPuerto Rico is represented in the U.S. Congress by a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives, the resident commissioner , currently Jenniffer González . Current congressional rules have removed the commissioner\\'s power to vote in the Committee of the Whole , but the commissioner can vote in committee.  \\n\nPuerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico .   Residents of Puerto Rico, including other U.S. citizens, cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, but can vote in primaries . Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state or Washington, D.C. can vote in presidential elections.\\n\nPuerto Rico has eight senatorial districts , 40 representative districts , and 78 municipalities ; there are no first-order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government. Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios , and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term. The municipality of San Juan is the oldest, founded in 1521;  the next earliest settlements are San Germán in 1570, Coamo in 1579, Arecibo in 1614, Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692. Increased settlement in the 18th century saw 30 more communities established, following 34 in the 19th century. Six were founded in the 20th century, the most recent being Florida in 1971.  \\n\nSince 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The three parties stand for different political status. The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island\\'s status with the U.S. as a commonwealth , while the PNP seeks to make Puerto Rico a U.S. state . Meanwhile, the PIP seeks to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation free from U.S. authority. In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the PIP holds about 5%.\\n\nAfter 2007, other parties emerged on the island. The first, the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party was registered that same year. The party claims that it seeks to address the islands\\' problems from a status-neutral platform. But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election. Four years later, the 2012 election saw the emergence of the Movimiento Unión Soberanista (English: Sovereign Union Movement) and the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador (English: Working People\\'s Party) but none obtained more than 1% of the vote.\\n\nOther non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , the Socialist Workers Movement , and the Hostosian National Independence Movement .\\n\nThe nature of Puerto Rico\\'s political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Congress, and the United Nations .  Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain an unincorporated territory of the U.S., become a U.S. state, or become an independent country.  \\n\nConstitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution .  Laws enacted at the federal level in the U.S. apply to Puerto Rico as well, regardless of its political status. Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress . Puerto Rico lacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation\", for example, the power to manage its \"external relations with other nations\", which is held by the U.S. federal government. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".  \\n\nPuerto Ricans \"were collectively made U.S. citizens\" in 1917 as a result of the Jones-Shafroth Act .  U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, though both major parties, Republican and Democratic, hold primary elections in Puerto Rico to choose delegates to vote on the parties\\' presidential candidates. Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and not a U.S. state, the U.S. Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.   \\n\nOnly fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans. Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and, since 1917, they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft when it has been in effect.\\n\nThough the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, residents of Puerto Rico, contrary to a popular misconception, do pay U.S. federal taxes: customs taxes (which are subsequently returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury), import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes, social security taxes, etc. Residents pay federal payroll taxes , such as Social Security and Medicare , as well as Commonwealth of Puerto Rico income taxes. All federal employees, those who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S., and some others, such as Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military, and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico also pay federal income taxes. In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because \"the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments.\"        \\n\nIn 2009, Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury .  Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement. They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income , and the island receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state.  Also, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system.  \\n\nPuerto Rico\\'s authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states. Thus, individuals committing a crime can only be tried in federal or territorial court, otherwise it would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.  \\n\nIn 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations.\\n\nMany federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico, just as in any state, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Federal Emergency Management Agency , Transportation Security Administration , Social Security Administration , and others. While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment. Sonia Sotomayor , a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent , serves as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions, including serving as U.S. ambassadors to other nations.\\n\nUnlike the vast majority of U.S. states, Puerto Rico has no first-order administrative divisions akin to counties , but has 78 municipalities or municipios as the secondary unit of administration; for U.S. Census purposes, the municipalities are considered county equivalents . Municipalities are subdivided into barrios , and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for four-year terms, per the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991 .\\n\nPuerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution and is thus restricted on how it can engage with other nations, sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one. As is the case with state governments, it has established several trade agreements with other nations, particularly with Latin American countries such as Colombia and Panamá.   \\n\nIt has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries, all Spanish-speaking, and within the U.S. itself, which now include Spain, the Dominican Republic, Panama , Colombia , Washington, D.C. , New York City and Florida, and has included in the past offices in Chile , Costa Rica , and Mexico . Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State; most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the U.S. and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states. Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries, mainly from the Americas and Europe, with most located in San Juan.  \\n\nAt the local level, Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico , an executive department , headed by the secretary of state of Puerto Rico , who also serves as the unincorporated territory\\'s lieutenant governor. It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration , along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner , manages all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the U.S. (including the federal government of the U.S., local and state governments of the U.S., and public or private entities in the U.S.). [ citation needed ] \\n\nBoth entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington, D.C.-based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico\\'s foreign affairs, such as the U.S. Department of State, the Agency for International Development , and others. The current secretary of state is Larry Seilhamer Rodríguez from the New Progressive Party, while the current director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Jennifer M. Stopiran also from the NPP and a member of the Republican Party of the U.S. [ citation needed ] \\n\nThe resident commissioner of Puerto Rico , the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government, including the U.S. Congress, sits in the U.S. House of Representatives, serves and votes on congressional committees, and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The current resident commissioner is Jenniffer González-Colón , a Republican, elected in 2016. She received more votes than any other official elected in Puerto Rico that year.  \\n\nMany Puerto Ricans have served as U.S. ambassadors to different nations and international organizations, such as the Organization of American States , mostly but not exclusively in Latin America. For example, Maricarmen Aponte, a Puerto Rican and now an acting assistant secretary of state, previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador .  \\n\nAs it is an unincorporated U.S. territory, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the U.S. as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the U.S. as its commander-in-chief . Puerto Rico has its own National Guard , and its own state defense force , the Puerto Rico State Guard , which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\\n\nThe commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico adjutant general , currently Major General José J. Reyes . The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole.\\nU.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command (LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM), which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic. Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM\\'s mission until 1999, when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as U.S. Joint Forces Command . Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of U.S. Northern Command .\\n\nBoth the Naval Forces Caribbean (NFC) and the Fleet Air Caribbean (FAIR) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean. With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities, the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico, except for the ships that steam by, and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan , the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards, and the U.S. Coast Guard . Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base. This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300 million.  \\n\nA branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico - known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard - which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of different U.S. states, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard - known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard - which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states.\\n\nAt different times in the 20th century, the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico.  The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba , the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) on Vieques , the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas , Fort Allen in Juana Diaz , the Army\\'s Fort Buchanan in San Juan, the former U.S. Air Force\\'s Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla, and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard\\'s Muñiz Air National Guard Base in San Juan .  \\n\nThe former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads, Vieques, and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government. Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities, there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico: the U.S. Army\\'s small Ft. Buchanan (supporting local veterans and reserve units) and the PRANG (Puerto Rico Air National Guard) Muñiz Air Base (the C-130 Fleet). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations, but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico - such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there.\\n\nPuerto Ricans have participated in many U.S. military conflicts, including the American Revolution , when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba , and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de Gálvez (1746-1786).  They continue to be disproportionately represented in present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .  The most notable example is the 65th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army, nicknamed The Borinqueneers, from the original Taíno name of the island (Borinquen). The all- Puerto Rican regiment participated in World War I , World War II , the Korean War , and the War on Terror ; in 2014, it was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for its heroism during the Korean War.\\n\nA significant number of Puerto Ricans serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, largely as National Guard members and civilian employees. The size of the overall military-related community is estimated to be 100,000, including retired personnel.  Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel. In addition, approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards, or the U.S. Reserve forces.  \\n\nThe insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems.\\n\nPuerto Rico is the only current U.S. jurisdiction whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English: namely, Spanish . Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English, all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts , and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.  [ original research? ] \\n\nTitle 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the U.S. Code to U.S. territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico. After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California . Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary, several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code .\\n\nThe judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court , which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico .  There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico , and someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court, and vice versa, since Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does.  Such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy .\\n\nThe homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014.   Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80% of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related.  \\n\nIn 1992, the FBI made armed carjacking a federal crime and rates decreased per statistics,  but as of 2019, the problem continued in municipalities like Guaynabo and others.      From 1 January 2019 to 14 March 2019, thirty carjackings had occurred on the island.  \\n\nEconomy\nPuerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .  It is considered the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum and ranks highly on the Human Development Index . According to World Bank , gross national income per capita in Puerto Rico in 2020 was $21,740.  Puerto Rico\\'s economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics) followed by services (primarily finance, insurance, real estate and tourism ); agriculture represents less than 1% of GNP.  [ o ] [ p ] In recent years, it has also become a popular destination for MICE ( meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions ), with a modern convention center district overlooking the Port of San Juan .  \\n\nResponsibility for San Juan port inspections lies with PPQ .  So high is the volume of cargo traffic that between 1984-2000 the San Juan PPQ station recorded 7.74% of all interceptions , #4 in the country, #2 for insects and #3 for pathogens .  Most species are originally from South America or elsewhere in the Caribbean due to PR\\'s position as an intermediary on the way to the mainland.  This is one of the worst locations for cut flowers and other plant parts - both in terms of number of problems and diversity of species - for insects in plant parts in baggage , and for pathogens in plant parts in baggage and cargo.  Pathogen interceptions were dramatically (17%) higher 1999-2000 than in 1985-1986.  \\n\nPuerto Rico\\'s geography and political status are both determining factors for its economic prosperity, primarily due to its relatively small size; lack of natural resources and subsequent dependence on imports ; and vulnerability to U.S. foreign policy and trading restrictions, particularly concerning its shipping industry .\\n\nPuerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by four quarters of economic growth, and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico. This IRS section was critical to the economy, as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time, without paying federal tax on corporate income. Puerto Rico has been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the world.  \\n\nAcademically, most of Puerto Rico\\'s economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired, have been repealed, or no longer apply to Puerto Rico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history; [ q ] its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power ; [ r ] as well as its highly inefficient local government [ s ] [ t ] which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout time. [ u ] [ v ] Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion (equivalent to 103% of GNP), and a government deficit of $2.5 billion.   \\n\nBy American standards, Puerto Rico is underdeveloped: It is poorer than Mississippi, the poorest state of the U.S., with 41% of its population below the poverty line . [ w ] However, it has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America. Puerto Rico\\'s main trading partners are the United States, Ireland , and Japan , with most products coming from East Asia , mainly China , Hong Kong , and Taiwan . Puerto Rico\\'s dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation, as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials, makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate .\\n\nTourism in Puerto Rico is also an important part of the economy. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure, disrupting tourism for many months. The damage was estimated at $100 billion. An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal.  By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up to 10% of Puerto Rico\\'s GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.  \\n\nA tourism campaign was launched by Discover Puerto Rico in 2018 intended to highlight the island\\'s culture and history, branding it distinct, and different from other Caribbean destinations. In 2019, Discover Puerto Rico planned to continue that campaign.  \\n\nIn early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion.  The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession.  \\n\nThe Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts, including bonds, since 2015. With debt payments due, the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system.   \"Without action before April, Puerto Rico\\'s ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico\", according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also said that \"Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico\\'s inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\"  \\n\nInitially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico\\'s governor Ricardo Rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by 28 January. Just before that deadline, the control board gave the Commonwealth government until 28 February to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to 31 May.  It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA .  An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rosselló government, with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt.  \\n\nIn early August 2017, the island\\'s financial oversight board (created by PROMESA) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees, down from the original plan of four days per month; the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings. Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary. Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.  \\n\nPuerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S.$9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion, creating a structural deficit of $775 million (about 7.9% of the budget).  The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 24 consecutive years starting in 2000. Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased Puerto Rico\\'s cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973. [ x ]  \\n\nProjected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71B or about 70% of Puerto Rico\\'s gross domestic product. This sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after Puerto Rico\\'s general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade (\"junk status\") by three credit-rating agencies. In terms of financial control, almost 9.6%\\xe2\\x80\\x94or about $1.5 billion\\xe2\\x80\\x94of Puerto Rico\\'s central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service. [ y ] Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the coming years. [ needs update ] \\n\nFor practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a \"general budget\" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico , and the \"consolidated budget\" which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget, by Puerto Rico\\'s government-owned corporations , by revenue expected from loans, by the sale of government bonds, by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States , and by other funds.\\n\nBoth budgets contrast each other drastically, with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently $29B and $9.0B respectively. Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budget.\\n\nThe critical aspects come from the sale of bonds, which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget - a ratio that increased annually due to the government\\'s inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses. In particular, the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt, as none is self-sufficient. For example, in FY2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) reporting losses of $409M, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island) reporting losses of $272M, while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island) reported losses of $112M.  \\n\nLosses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of Puerto Rico\\'s entire public debt today.  Holistically, from FY2000-FY2010 Puerto Rico\\'s debt grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% while GDP remained stagnant.  This has not always provided a long-term solution. In early July 2017 for example, the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9 billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek Court protection.  \\n\nThe cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade. [ z ]        \\n\nStatistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs, such as the high cost of electricity, which has hovered in the 24\\xc2 2 to 30\\xc2 2 range per kilowatt-hour, two to three times the national average, increased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers \"outside the continental United States\". While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories.\\n\nThe household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau\\'s 2015 update. The report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level.  The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S.$100,000 to U.S.$214,000, while the national median home value sits at $119,600. [ aa ] \\n\nOne of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 , also known as the Jones Act , which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports, a practice known as cabotage .  Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America , Western Europe , and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.  The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success. [ ab ] \\n\nIn 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that \"repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs\" and that \"shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs\". [ ac ] [ ad ] Ultimately, the report concluded that \"[the] effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain\" for both Puerto Rico and the U.S., particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the U.S.   A 2018 study by economists at Boston-based Reeve & Associates and Puerto Rico-based Estudios Tecnicos has concluded that the 1920 Jones Act has no impact on either retail prices or the cost of living on Puerto Rico.  \\n\nCities and towns in Puerto Rico are interconnected by a system of roads, freeways , expressways , and highways maintained by the Highways and Transportation Authority under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation , and patrolled by the Puerto Rico Police Department . The island\\'s San Juan metropolitan area is served by a public bus transit system and a metro system called Tren Urbano (\\'Urban Train\\'). Other forms of Puerto Rican public transport include seaborne ferries that serve Puerto Rico\\'s archipelago as well as carros públicos ( private mini buses ).\\n\nPuerto Rico has three international airports , the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Carolina , Mercedita International Airport in Ponce, and the Rafael Hernández International Airport in Aguadilla, and 27 local airports. The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport is the largest aerial transportation hub in the Caribbean.  \\n\nPuerto Rico has nine ports in different cities across the main island. The San Juan Port is the largest in Puerto Rico, and the busiest port in the Caribbean and the 10th busiest in the United States in terms of commercial activity and cargo movement, respectively.  The second largest port is the Port of the Americas in Ponce, currently under expansion to increase cargo capacity to 1.5 million twenty-foot containers ( TEUs ) per year.  \\n\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA, Spanish : Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, AEE )\\xe2\\x80\\x94is an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation , power transmission , and power distribution in Puerto Rico.  PREPA was, by law, the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly until 2018. The Authority is ruled by a governing board appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico , and is run by an executive director.\\n\nOn 20 July 2018, Puerto Rico Law 120-2018 ( Ley para Transformar el Sistema Eléctrico de Puerto Rico ) was signed. This law authorized PREPA to sell infrastructure and services to other providers. As a result, a contract was signed on 22 June 2020, making LUMA Energy the new operator of the energy distribution and transmission infrastructure, as well as other areas of PREPA\\'s operations, in effect partially privatizing the Puerto Rican power grid. The takeover was set for 1 June 2021, amidst protests and uncertainty from the point of view of the general public and the former-PREPA workers and union members .   \\n\nSimilarly, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA, Spanish : Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, AAA )\\xe2\\x80\\x94is a water company and the government-owned corporation responsible for water quality , management , and supply in Puerto Rico.  It is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly. Its existence is designated by Law No. 40 of 1 May 1945, including the corresponding amendments.  \\n\nTelecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  As of 2007 [update] , there were 30 TV stations, 125 radio stations and roughly 1 million TV sets on the island. Cable TV subscription services are available, and the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service also broadcast on the island.  Puerto Rico also has its own amateur radio prefixes , which differ from those of the contiguous United States in that there are two letter before the number. The most well-known prefix is KP4, but others separated for use on the archipelago (including Desecheo and Mona) are: KP3/KP4/NP3/NP4/WP3/WP4 (Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra ) and KP5/NP5/WP5 ( Desecheo Island ).  Amateur radio operators (also known as ham radio operators) are a well-known group in the island and can obtain special vehicle license plates with their callsign on them.  They have been a key element in disaster relief.  \\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Puerto Rico has been shaped by initial Amerindian settlement , European colonization , slavery , economic migration, and Puerto Rico\\'s status as unincorporated territory of the United States.\\n\nThe most populous municipality is the capital, San Juan , with 342,259 people based on the 2020 Census .  Other major cities include Bayamón , Carolina , Ponce , and Caguas . Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered San Juan\\'s metropolitan area , while the other two are located in the south ( Ponce ) and west ( Mayagüez ) of the island.\\n\nPuerto Rico was 98.9% Hispanic or Latino in 2020, of that 95.5% were Puerto Rican and 3.4% were Hispanic of non-Puerto Rican origins. Only 1.1% of the population was non-Hispanic.  The population of Puerto Rico according to the 2020 census was 3,285,874, an 11.8% decrease since the 2010 United States Census .  The commonwealth\\'s population peaked in 2000, when it was 3,808,610, before declining (for the first time in census history) to 3,725,789 in 2010.  Emigration due to economic difficulties and natural disasters, coupled with a low birth rate, have caused the population decline to continue in recent years.  \\n\nCensuses of Puerto Rico were completed by Spain in 1765, 1775, 1800, 1815, 1832, 1846 and 1857, yet some of the data remained untabulated and was not considered reliable according to Irene Barnes Taeuber , an American demographer who worked for the Office of Population Research at Princeton University .  \\n\nContinuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 to almost a million by the close of the 19th century. A census conducted by royal decree on 30 September 1858, gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time: 341,015 were free colored ; 300,430 were white ; and 41,736 were slaves .  A census in 1887 found a population of around 800,000, of which 320,000 were black.  \\n\nDuring the 19th century, hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia , Asturias , Galicia and the Balearic Islands and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain\\'s former colonies in South America. Settlers from outside Spain also arrived in the islands, including from Corsica , France , Lebanon , Portugal , Ireland , Scotland , Germany and Italy . This immigration from non-Hispanic countries was the result of the Real Cédula de Gracias de 1815 ( Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 ), which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island, provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church.\\n\nBetween 1960 and 1990, the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity. The 2000 United States Census included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico. According to the census, most Puerto Ricans identified as white and Latino; few identified as black or some other race.\\n\nA Pew Research survey indicated an adult literacy rate of 90.4% in 2012 based on data from the United Nations .  \\n\nPuerto Rico has a life expectancy of approximately 82.1 years according to the CIA World Factbook, an improvement from 78.7 years in 2010.  \\n\nThe vast majority of recent immigrants, both legal and illegal, come from Latin America , over half come from the Dominican Republic . Dominicans represent 53% of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics, about 1.8% of Puerto Rico\\'s population.  Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic,   and Cuba [ citation needed ] , use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the U.S. mainland. Other major sources of recent immigrants include Cuba , Colombia , Mexico , Venezuela , Haiti , Honduras , Panama , Ecuador , Spain , and Jamaica .   Additionally, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico from the U.S. mainland, majority of which are White Americans and a smaller number are Black Americans . In fact, non-hispanic people represent 1.1% and majority of them are from the U.S. mainland. Smaller numbers of U.S. citizens come from the U.S. Virgin Islands . There are also large numbers of Nuyoricans and other stateside Puerto Ricans coming back, as many Puerto Ricans engage in \\'circular migration\\'.  Small numbers of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics in Puerto Rico are actually American-born migrants from the mainland U.S. and not recent immigrants. Most recent immigrants settle in and around the San Juan metropolitan area.\\n\nEmigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history. Starting soon after World War II , poverty, cheap airfares, and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the U.S. mainland, particularly to the northeastern states and nearby Florida .  This trend continued even as Puerto Rico\\'s economy improved and its birth rate declined. Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of \" circular migration \", with some migrants returning to the island. In recent years, the population has declined markedly, falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% (36,000 people) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration.  The impact of hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017, combined with the unincorporated territory\\'s worsening economy, led to its greatest population decline since the U.S. acquired the archipelago.\\n\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. census , the number of Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico in the U.S. is almost twice as many as those living in Puerto Rico.  As those who leave tend to be better educated than those who remain, this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico\\'s economy.\\n\nBased on 1 July 2019 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau , the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 532,095 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated.  \\n\nThe official languages  of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico  are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law.  However, all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population.  \\n\nOut of people aged five and older, 94.3% speak only Spanish at home, 5.5% speak English, and 0.2% speak other languages.  \\n\nIn Puerto Rico, public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English.  English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant, Puerto Rican Sign Language .\\n\nThe Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Taíno words, as well as English words. The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands . Taíno loanwords are most often used in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena, and native musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music, and dances, particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans.  \\n\nReligious affiliation in Puerto Rico (2014)   \\n\nCatholicism was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico , were authorized by Pope Julius II in 1511.  In 1512, priests were established for the parochial churches. By 1759, there was a priest for each church.  One Pope, John Paul II , visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are located at the town center, or plaza .\\n\nProtestantism , which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, has reemerged under U.S. rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Santísima Trinidad , was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872.  It was the first non-Catholic church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas .   \\n\nPollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38% Roman Catholic, 28% Pentecostal, and 18% were members of independent churches, which would give a Protestant percentage of 46% if the last two populations are combined. Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people. Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants:\\n\nPuerto Rico, by virtue of its long political association with the United States, is the most Protestant of Latin American countries, with a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of whom are Pentecostal . David Stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960 to 1985 for another twenty-five years Puerto Rico will become 75 percent evangelical. (Ana Adams: \"Brincando el Charco...\" in Power, Politics and Pentecostals in Latin America , Edward Cleary, ed., 1997. p. 164). \nAn Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as Catholic\" but provided no source for this information.  \\n\nThe CIA World Factbook reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other. Neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent.  A 2013 Pew Research survey found that only about 45% of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic, 29% as Protestant and 20% as unaffiliated with a religion. The people surveyed by Pew consisted of Puerto Ricans living in the 50 states and DC and may not be indicative of those living in the Commonwealth.  \\n\nBy 2014, a Pew Research report, with the sub-title Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region , indicated that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic, 33% were Protestant, and 8% were unaffiliated; this survey was completed between October 2013 and February 2014.   \\n\nAn Eastern Orthodox community, the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos / St. Spyridon\\'s Church is located in Trujillo Alto, and serves the small Orthodox community in the area.  In 2017, the church entered communion with the Roman Catholic Church, becoming the first Eastern Catholic Church in Puerto Rico.  This affiliation accounted for under 1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report.  There are two Eastern Orthodox Churches in the territory; the Russian Orthodox Mission Saint John Climacus in San German and the Saint George Antiochian Orthodox Church in Carolina . Both have services in English and Spanish.   There is a small Syriac Orthodox church in Aguada which is also the only Oriental Orthodox in the Island and serves a small growing community in the area. In 1940, Juanita García Peraza founded the Mita Congregation , the first religion of Puerto Rican origin.  Taíno religious practices have been rediscovered/reinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates.  Similarly, some aspects of African religious traditions have been kept by some adherents. African slaves brought and maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples; in particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santería or Ifá , and the Kongo -derived Palo Mayombe . Some aspects were absorbed into syncretic Christianity. In 1952, a handful of American Jews established the island\\'s first synagogue ; this religion accounts for under 1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report.   The synagogue, called Sha\\'are Zedeck , hired its first rabbi in 1954.  Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, numbering 3000 people,  and is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative , Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements all are represented.   In 2007, there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population.   Eight mosques are located throughout the island, with most Muslims living in Río Piedras and Caguas ; most Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent.   There is also a Bahá\\xca\\xbcí community.  In 2023, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated a temple in San Juan ,  and reported having a membership of approximately 23,000 in the commonwealth.  In 2015, the 25,832 Jehovah\\'s Witnesses represented about 0.70% of the population, with 324 congregations.  Buddhism in Puerto Rico is represented with Nichiren , Zen and Tibetan Buddhism , with the New York Padmasambhava Buddhist Center for example having a branch in San Juan.  There are several atheist activist and educational organizations, and an atheistic parody religion called the Pastafarian Church of Puerto Rico.  An ISKCON temple in Gurabo is devoted to Krishna , with two preaching centers in the San Juan metropolitan area.\\n\nThe first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gramática (Grammar School). It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed. The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language , literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.  \\n\nEducation in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels\\xe2\\x80\\x94Primary (elementary school grades 1-6), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7-12), and Higher Level (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and 94.4% for females.  According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor\\'s degree or higher.\\n\nInstruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18. As of 2010 [update] , there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.  \\n\nThe largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico (UPR) with 11 campuses. The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo , Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este . Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University , the Pontifical Catholic University , Universidad Politécnica de Puerto Rico , and the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón . Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA -approved Law Schools.\\n\nIn 2017, there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico.  \\n\nReforma de Salud de Puerto Rico ( Puerto Rico Health Reform ) - locally referred to as La Reforma (\\'The Reform\\') - is a government-run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished , by means of contracting private health insurance companies, rather than employing government-owned hospitals and emergency centers. The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration.  \\n\nCulture\nModern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including European (predominantly Spanish, Italian , French , German and Irish ), African, and, more recently, some North American and many South Americans. Many Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades.\\n\nFrom the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English-language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On 12 March 1903, the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal Industrial\", a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years earlier.\\n\nMuch of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms. Early in the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable. The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico.   \\n\nPuerto Rico has many symbols, but only the Flor de Maga has been made official by the Government of Puerto Rico.  Other popular, traditional, or unofficial symbols of Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican spindalis , the kapok tree , the coquí frog , the jíbaro , the Taíno Indian , and Cerro Las Tetas with its jíbaro culture monument .   \\n\nThe architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions, styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule, and a century of American rule. Spanish colonial architecture , Ibero-Islamic , art deco , post-modern , and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions.\\n\nOld San Juan is one of the two barrios , in addition to Santurce , that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951, at which time the former independent municipality of Río Piedras was annexed. With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air cafés, restaurants, gracious homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism. The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San José Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista , which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León . It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico, the Colegio de Párvulos, built in 1865.\\n\nThe oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts , such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro , Fort San Cristóbal , and El Palacio de Santa Catalina , also known as La Fortaleza , acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the governor of Puerto Rico . Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site .\\n\nDuring the 1940s, sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair, and many renovation plans were suggested. There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a \"small Manhattan \". Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared as a historic building, and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas, particularly Havana , Lima and Cartagena de Indias .\\n\nPonce Creole is a unique architectural style created in Ponce, Puerto Rico , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of France, Spain and the Caribbean vernacular to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico\\'s Caribbean Sea coast.  It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian .  \\n\nPuerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background. A form of folk art , called santos evolved from the Catholic Church\\'s use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity . Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors. Santos vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special place on household altars , where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection.\\n\nAlso popular, caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals . Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented. True to their historic origins, Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs. While usually constructed of papier-m\\xc3 2ché , coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well. Red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns.\\n\nPuerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present-day status. Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government. Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write. Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition and in 1647 wrote Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico (\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\"). This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.  \\n\nSome of Puerto Rico\\'s earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero . Among these was Manuel A. Alonso , the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance. In 1849 he published El Gíbaro , a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer. Eugenio María de Hostos wrote La peregrinación de Bayoán in 1863, which used Bartolomé de las Casas as a springboard to reflect on Caribbean identity. After this first novel, Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change.\\n\nIn the late 19th century, with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters, Puerto Rican literature began to flourish. The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists. Alejandro Tapia y Rivera , also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature, ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of The Historical Library of Puerto Rico . Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer. His work The Indo-Antillano Vocabulary is valuable in understanding the way the Taínos lived. Manuel Zeno Gandía in 1894 wrote La Charca and talked about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. Antonio S. Pedreira , described in his work Insularismo the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion.\\n\nWith the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s, Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement . Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish, and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors, journalists, poets, novelists, playwrights, essayists, and screenwriters. The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the U.S. and the rest of the world. Over the past fifty years, significant writers include Ed Vega ( Omaha Bigelow ), Miguel Piñero ( Short Eyes ), Piri Thomas ( Down These Mean Streets ), Giannina Braschi ( Yo-Yo Boing! ), Rosario Ferrer (Eccentric Neighborhoods). and Esmeralda Santiago ( When I was Puerto Rican ).   \\n\nThe mass media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations , television stations and newspapers , the majority of which are conducted in Spanish . There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service . Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo Día , El Vocero and \\xc3\\x8dndice , Metro , and Primera Hora . El Vocero is distributed free of charge, as are \\xc3\\x8dndice and Metro .\\n\nNewspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include Claridad , La Perla del Sur , La Opinión , Visión , and La Estrella del Norte , among others. Several television channels provide local content in the island. These include WIPR-TV , Telemundo , Univision affiliate WLII-DT ( Teleonce ), WAPA-TV , and WKAQ-TV .\\n\nThe music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources. The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and, over the last century, from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from indigenous genres like bomba , plena , aguinaldo , danza and the popular salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton .\\n\nPuerto Rico has some national instruments, like the cuatro (Spanish for \"four\"). The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the \"Jibaro\" or people from the mountains. Originally, the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings, hence its name, but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings. It is easily confused with a guitar, even by locals. When held upright, from right to left, the strings are G, D, A, E, B.\\n\nIn the realm of classical music , the island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinfónica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, drawing in classical musicians from around the world.\\n\nWith respect to opera , the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated, that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia . In 1907, Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera - when he participated in a performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan, Italy .\\n\nPuerto Rico has been commemorated on four U.S. postal stamps. Insular Territories were commemorated in 1937, the third stamp honored Puerto Rico featuring \\' La Fortaleza \\', the Spanish Governor\\'s Palace.  The first free election for governor of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico was honored on 27 April 1949, at San Juan, Puerto Rico. \\'Inauguration\\' on the 3-cent stamp refers to the election of Luis Muñoz Marín , the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico.  San Juan, Puerto Rico was commemorated with an 8-cent stamp on its 450th anniversary issued 12 September 1971, featuring a sentry box from Castillo San Felipe del Morro .  In the \"Flags of our nation series\" 2008-2012, of the fifty-five, five territorial flags were featured. Forever stamps included the Puerto Rico Flag illustrated by a bird issued 2011.  \\n\nPuerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe (Spain), Africa and the native Taínos . Basic ingredients include grains and legumes , herbs and spices , starchy tropical tubers , vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood and shellfish, and fruits. Main dishes include mofongo , arroz con gandules , pasteles , and pig roast (or lechón ). Beverages include maví and piña colada . Desserts include flan, arroz con dulce (sweet rice pudding ), piraguas , brazo gitanos , tembleque , polvorones , and dulce de leche .\\n\nBaseball was one of the first sports to gain widespread popularity in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Baseball League serves as the only active professional league, operating as a winter league. No Major League Baseball franchise or affiliate plays in Puerto Rico; however, San Juan hosted the Montreal Expos for several series in 2003 and 2004 before they moved to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals .\\n\nThe Puerto Rico national baseball team has participated in the World Cup of Baseball winning one gold (1951), four silver and four bronze medals, the Caribbean Series (winning fourteen times) and the World Baseball Classic . In March 2006 , San Juan\\'s Hiram Bithorn Stadium hosted the opening round as well as the second round of the newly formed World Baseball Classic . Puerto Rican baseball players include Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente , Orlando Cepeda and Roberto Alomar , enshrined in 1973, 1999, and 2011 respectively.    \\n\nBoxing , basketball , and volleyball are considered popular sports as well. Wilfredo Gómez and McWilliams Arroyo have won their respective divisions at the World Amateur Boxing Championships . Other medalists include José Pedraza , who holds a silver medal, and three boxers who finished in third place, José Luis Vellón, Nelson Dieppa and McJoe Arroyo . In the professional circuit, Puerto Rico has the third-most boxing world champions and it is the global leader in champions per capita. These include Miguel Cotto , Félix Trinidad , Wilfred Benítez and Gómez among others.\\n\nThe Puerto Rico national basketball team joined the International Basketball Federation in 1957. Since then, it has won more than 30 medals in international competitions, including gold in three FIBA Americas Championships and the 1994 Goodwill Games 8 August 2004, became a landmark date for the team when it became the first team to defeat the United States in an Olympic tournament since the integration of National Basketball Association players.
