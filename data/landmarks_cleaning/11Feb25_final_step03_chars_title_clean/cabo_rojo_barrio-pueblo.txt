The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nLocated across from the central plaza in Cabo Rojo barrio-pueblo is the Parroquia San Miguel Arc√°ngel which was built between 1771 and 1783. Partly destroyed by lightning in 1861, the roof was rebuilt. Its current facade was designed by Onofre Llompart and its construction began in 1878. In 1965, the roof was changed as well as the church interior.  \\n\nHistory\nCabo Rojo barrio-pueblo was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States .
