Its population in 2010 was 2,279.     \\n\nAs was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.   \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nLocated across the central plaza in Patillas barrio-pueblo is the Parroquia Inmaculado Corazón de María (English: Immaculate Heart of Mary Parish), a Roman Catholic church. The first church was inaugurated in 1811. Its replacement built in 1848 was destroyed by the San Felipe Segundo hurricane in 1928. Designed by Francisco Porrata Dora, the church which stands there now was constructed in the 1930s. In 1995, the church was remodeled with lateral extensions.  \\n\nHistory\nPatillas barrio-pueblo was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Pueblo was 1,590.  \\n \\n\nIn July 2020, Federal Emergency Management Agency appropriated funds for repairs to Patillas\\' plaza.  \\n\nSectors\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nThe following sectors are in Patillas barrio-pueblo:  \\n\nResidencial Villa del Caribe, \\nUrbanización Jardines de Patillas, \\nUrbanización Jardines del Mamey, \\nUrbanización Joseira, \\nUrbanización Mariani, \\nUrbanización Melissa, \\nUrbanización Parque del Sol, \\nUrbanización San Benito, \\nUrbanización San Martín , and Urbanización Villas de Patillas .\\n\nSee also\nReferences",
