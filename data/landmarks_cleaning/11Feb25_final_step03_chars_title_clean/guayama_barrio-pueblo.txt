Its population in 2010 was 16,891.     \\n\n\\nAs was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.   The historic downtown area ( pueblo ) of Guayama was added to the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones  in 1992. \nHistory\nGuayama barrio-pueblo was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Guayama Pueblo was 5,334.  \\n \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nThe central plaza ( plaza de recreo ) is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"parties\" (celebrations, festivities, festivals) ( \"a propósito para las fiestas\" ), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors ( \"grandeza proporcionada al\\nnúmero de vecinos\" ). These Spanish regulations also stated that nearby streets should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nThe Guayama patron saint festival, in honor of Saint Anthony of Padua , is celebrated at the Plaza de recreo Cristóbal Colón in Guayama barrio-pueblo every June.\\n\nLocated across from the central plaza in Guayama barrio-pueblo is Iglesia de San Antonio de Padua , or the Parroquia San Antonio de Padua (English: Anthony of Padua Parish), a Roman Catholic church. A hermitage built in the area was in ruins by 1823. The first church after that was inaugurated in 1872. Parts of the church were destroyed by the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane . In the 1920s the church underwent reconstruction.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences",
