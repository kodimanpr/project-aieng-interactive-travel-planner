Throughout its history it has also been known as the Militia Guard Headquarters ( Cuartel de la Guardia de Milicias ), Parador del Rey , and the Municipal Jail of Dorado ( Cárcel Municipal de Dorado ).\\n\nThe building, the oldest in town, provided housing for Spanish government personnel and also served as the regional military headquarters. In 1848, Jacinto López purchased the structure. In converting it into a residence, López added two wings which created a U-shaped configuration around an interior patio. In 1871, Casa del Rey became the home of Manuel Alonso y Pacheco , Puerto Rico\\'s notable romantic writer.\\n\nIt was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1989 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.
