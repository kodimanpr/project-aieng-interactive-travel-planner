It contains about 708 million gallons of water. The reserve was designated in 1979 through a program of Coastal Zone Management PR. It is located between the municipalities of Vega Baja and Manatí . It covers approximately 2.43 km 2 (0.94 sq mi).  \\n\nIt is divided into two main parts: in the east and northeast, the Laguna Grande (\"Big Lagoon\" in English), and in the south, the Laguna Rica. A swamp located northeast of the pond, El Cabo Caribe (\"Cape Caribbean\" in English), includes one of the most important areas of the reserve as a source of nesting and feeding waterflow ecosystem.\\n\nGenerally, Tortuguero is made up of swamps, marshes, soils of silica sand and hills. Although not a forest, its variety of rare endemic plants and flowers has earned it a place amongst the most important reserves in Puerto Rico, just after El Yunque , Toro Negro State Forest and the Forest of Maricao .\\n\nNative, exotic and endemic species in the reserve\nNative species:\\n\nEndemic species:\\n\nExotic species:\\n\nFlora\nThe flora of this reserve is the fourth most important in Puerto Rico.
