The mall opened in 1997, and is currently anchored by a Sector Sixty6 entertainment center which takes up the space of a previous Big Kmart , a Forever 21 junior anchor store, and a Ross Dress for Less which is scheduled to open in 2025 in the former Sears store at the mall which closed their doors in February 2021,  The Shops at Caguas are home to the first \"large premium format\" movie theater in Puerto Rico (and second in the Caribbean region, at the time of its opening), currently owned and managed by Caribbean Cinemas .  \\n\nHistory\nThe mall\\'s previous name of Las Catalinas is an homage to the 19th century, when the current shopping center property was the site of a sugarcane plantation, Hacienda Santa Catalina . In addition to sugar production, and left with copious amounts of leftover post-processing sugarcane, Hacienda Santa Catalina also produced rum , as well as cultivated many fruits.  \\n\nIn April 1997, Vornado Realty Trust announced that it would acquire Kmart\\'s 50% interest in the then-Caguas Centrum, as the center was previously known, which was currently under construction. The name of the mall would then be changed to Las Catalinas.  \\n\nOn December 4, 1997, after development by Manley Berenson and Yebba Realty Ventures, Las Catalinas Mall officially opened with 80 stores and 3,000 parking spaces. It was anchored at the time by a Kmart Super Center and a Sears department store. It also featured a food court , \"El Trapiche.\" The mall was built with the purpose to serve the surrounding communities, but its variety of businesses lead it to become a regionally popular destination.   \\n\nOn November 4, 1998, Vornado Realty Trust bought Kmart\\'s 50% interest in the mall, forming a joint ownership between Vornado and Yebba Realty Ventures. In addition, Vornado acquired 75% and Yebba Realty Ventures acquired 25% of Kmart\\'s anchor store. Vornado\\'s total purchase price was about $38 million.  \\n\nBy the year 2000, the successful mall had over 100  tenants, including many popular businesses of American origin, such as 5-7-9 , Afterthoughts , Claire\\'s Boutique , Electronics Boutique , Footaction , Hallmark , KB Toys , Payless ShoeSource , RadioShack , Zales , and many others. The food court and restaurant options included El Mes√≥n , Hot Potato, Howard Johnson\\'s , KFC , Quiznos , Taco Bell , Wetzel\\'s Pretzels , and more.   \\n\nAlso in the early 2000s, additional land was developed to open The Home Depot home improvement store and a Caribbean Cinemas theater. These additions complimented the mall\\'s variety, and would help to enhance the status of Las Catalinas as a top regional shopping destination.  \\n\nIn December 2001, Amigo Supermarkets announced that they would be opening a location at the mall by summer 2002.  \\n\nOn September 23, 2002, Vornado Realty Trust increased its interest in Las Catalinas to 100% by acquiring the other 50% of the mall from Yebba Realty Ventures and the 25% from the Kmart anchor store. The purchase price was approximately $48 million.  \\n\nIn 2010, an Adidas store and an iShop opened stores in the mall.\\n\nIn April 2012, it was announced that Best Buy , which was located on the premises of the mall, would be closing by mid-May 2012.  \\n\nIn January 2015, Vornado Realty Trust announced they would subsume some of their properties, including Las Catalinas, into a new company, Urban Edge Properties .  \\n\nIn July 2015, Sears Holdings reconfigured 235 of their properties, including the store at Las Catalinas, into Seritage Growth Properties .  \\n\nIn July 2015, a 13,773\\xc2\\xb2-foot Forever 21 clothing store opened at the mall, the chain\\'s fifth store on the island, at the time.  \\n\nOn November 8, 2018, Sears Holdings announced that Kmart would be closing as part of a company-wide plan to shutter around 40 stores in the U.S. and P.R. The store officially closed on January 31, 2019.  \\n\nOn December 28, 2020, it was announced that Sears would also be closing in February 2021 as part of a company-wide plan to close 23 stores nationwide, leaving the mall temporarily with no anchor tenants.  \\n\nIn February 2021, it was announced that a 22,000\\xc2\\xb2-foot Coast Guard Exchange (CGX) would be opening in the former Office Depot space at the mall, scheduled to open by summer of that year.  \\n\nIn August 2021, it was announced that a Sector Sixty6 Entertainment Center and a Golden Corral restaurant would replace the former Kmart store. They were expected to open by 2022, but were delayed until summer 2023.  \\n\nIn August 2022, a 1,916\\xc2\\xb2-foot Tous store opened at the mall.  \\n\nIn June 2023, it was announced that both a 2,109\\xc2\\xb2-foot Hot Topic store, and a 5,520\\xc2\\xb2-foot Puma store would be coming to the mall.
