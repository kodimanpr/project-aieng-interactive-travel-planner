Since then, it has become the most important performing arts venue in the Puerto Rican capital, presenting the highest level of commercial theater in Puerto Rico along with ballets and operas, and also hosting artists such as Plácido Domingo and Menudo . The center is home to the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra and the annual Casals Festival .\\n\nIn January 2019, Lin-Manuel Miranda 's musical Hamilton began its third touring production at the venue, with Miranda reprising the title role of Founding Father and Secretary of Treasury , Alexander Hamilton , with higher praise than his original run on Broadway.
