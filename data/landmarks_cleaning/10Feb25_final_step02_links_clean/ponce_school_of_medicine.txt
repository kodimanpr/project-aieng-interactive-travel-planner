It awards graduate degrees in Medicine (MD), Clinical Psychology (PsyD and PhD), Biomedical Sciences (PhD), Medical Sciences (MS), and Public Health (MPH and DrPH). The university has 360 students in its medical school and, as of 11 February 2019, was authorized to increase the student body at the medical school to 600 which, when fully in place, will make it the largest private medical school in Puerto Rico and one of the largest under the American flag.  \\n\nHistory\nWhat is now Ponce Health Sciences University began in 1976 as the school of medicine of the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico . Soon after its first medical class in 1977, the university decided to not continue its medical program. In order to save the only medical program in the region, a group of lay and professional leaders in southern Puerto Rico acquired the school of medicine and established the independent Ponce Medical School Foundation, Inc. as a non-profit organization in January 1980. In July 1980, the Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico (CHE-PR) authorized the Foundation to operate a medical school under the name Ponce School of Medicine.  In 1981, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accredited the school to grant the Doctor of Medicine degree.\\n\nIn 1983, the institution applied for funds under the Minority Biomedical Research Support Program (MBRS) and the Research Center in Minority Institutions (RCMI) Program. A Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences (PhD) was initiated in 1988, and in 1992 the Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico (CHE-PR) accredited the PhD Program and authorized PHSU to award a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in Biomedical Sciences.\\n\nIn January 1995, the academic institution moved to a new campus with additional facilities. A Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program (PsyD Program) was begun in 1999 which was later expanded to offer a PhD in Psychology, Professional Certificate in Couples and Family Therapy, and Postgraduate Certificate in Neuroscience of Learning.\\n\nIn August 2002 a Master\\'s of Public Health (MPH) program was started with specialization in Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and General Public Health. A DrPH in Epidemiology is also offered. On 5 September 2014, the Ponce School of Medicine and Health Sciences was acquired by Arist Corporation, which itself is an investment of global media, services and education company Bertelsmann .   \\n\nThe university has a campus in St. Louis, Missouri. In March 2020 the school \"announced an $80 million investment toward creating a new medical school\" near their downtown location and on the former Pruitt-Igoe site.  \\n\nOrganization\nResearch\nThe Ponce Research Institute (PRI) at Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) performs research in the basic, behavioral, public health, and clinical sciences. Research areas include non-communicable diseases (cancer, women\\'s health, gastrointestinal disorders), health disparities, infectious diseases (HIV, dengue), neurosciences and behavioral sciences, genetics, and community health outreach (obesity, smoking).\\n\nIn 2002, an academic partnership was established with the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute , with involvement of the National Cancer Institute .   \\n\nA grant awarded to the Oregon Health & Science University Neuro-Oncology Blood Brain Barrier Program has given many PHSU students the opportunity to participate in research and clinical fellowships.  \\n\nOn 4 December 2014, Andreas Charalambous, executive dean of the University of Nicosia Medical School (UNMS), and David Lenihan, president and CEO of PHSU, signed an agreement to promote academic cooperation and collaboration in research.  \\n\nLicenses and accreditation\nThe Ponce Health Sciences University is accredited by the following entities:\\n\nNotable alumni and members\nReferences\nExternal links",
