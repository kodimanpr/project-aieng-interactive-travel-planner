It is part of the Palo Seco barrio of the municipality of Toa Baja . The island is home to El Cañuelo fort , which alongside El Morro castle on San Juan Islet , protected San Juan Bay , the harbor of the historic city of Old San Juan , from competing world powers during the Age of Sail .\\n\nIsla de Cabras is the current location of:\\n\nHistory\nDue to its strategic location at the entrance of San Juan Bay, Isla de Cabras provided a strategic point for an effective crossfire with Fort San Felipe del Morro to prevent incoming ships from entering. It also provided defenses for the entrance of the Bayamón River on the other side of the islet.\\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a leper colony was established on the island. On December 17, 1876, the governor of Puerto Rico , Segundo de la Portilla , set the first stone of the official building to house lepers, which was completed in 1883. However, it is believed that the colony was established prior to construction of the building.

According to the 1910 US Census , there were 35 people living on the island at that time.

However, the original building still stands on Isla de Cabras.\\n\nIn the 1940s, the United States built Fort Amezquita (named for Juan de Amézqueta ), a few hundred feet from El Cañuelo . The fort was initially called the \"Cabras Island Military Reservation\". During World War II this fort served as a \"concrete gun battery\" for the US Army Coast Artillery Corps . In November 1940 the US Army transferred the barrels of three 12-inch coastal guns from Fort Delaware , Delaware ; two of these guns were mounted in the fort as Battery Reed with the third as a spare. They were on long-range M1917 barbette carriages and protected by concrete casemates . [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn recent years, the grounds that belonged to Fort Amezquita were converted into a shooting range and training area by the P.R.P.D. Ownership of the remaining acres of land were under legal dispute, until they were finally transferred to the Department of Sports and Recreation and opened to the public as the Isla de Cabras Recreational Park,  which is equipped with several gazebos and includes a beach for swimming and fishing.\\n\nGallery\nPlaces and views of Isla de Cabras:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links",
