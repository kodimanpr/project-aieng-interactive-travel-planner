It is located in Torrecilla Baja barrio in the municipality of Loíza . It is a tourist attraction and is managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources.   \\n\nGeographical location\nHome of a mangrove forest , Piñones is a natural reserve located east of Isla Verde north of Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport . It is operated by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources and located in Loiza .    \\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe extremely rare tree Schoepfia arenaria grows here at a place called Punta Maldonado. Less than 200 of these Puerto Rican endemic trees are known to exist.  \\n\nThe Piñones Trail\nThere is a boardwalk and trail used for biking and walking through parts of the forest. Several agencies carefully manage the Piñones Trail (in Spanish : Paseo Piñones ), so as to avoid disturbing sensitive ecological and archeological points, while still encouraging \"family-type\" visits. In 2001, the trail received an award from the Federal Highway Administration for excellence in non-motorized transportation.   \\n\nActivities nearby\nNear the forest is a beach called Playa Aviones and kiosks including, Kiosko El Boricua on PR-187 mentioned by the Puerto Rico Tourism Company .  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences",
