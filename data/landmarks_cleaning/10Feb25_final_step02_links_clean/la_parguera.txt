Lajas is spread over 11 barrios plus Lajas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Germán-Cabo Rojo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nLocated in the Lajas Valley , the town was founded in 1883 by the Xueta Teodoro Jácome Pagán . Xuetes ( Chuetas ) were Majorcan Jews ( Sephardic Catalan Jews). Some families changed their names from Jácome to the Castilian form Santiago . Jácome is the Mallorquin form of James (Ia\\'akov). Catalan Jews from Majorca were part of the early settlers in the south of Borikén (Puerto Rico).\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a colony of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Lajas was 8,789.  \\n\nThe village of La Parguera is a popular tourist destination to see the famous Bahía Fosforescente (Phosphorescent Bay) and its numerous keys and islets.  Parador La Parguera was founded by Puerto Rican comedian Henry LaFont (Julio Pancorbo Ortiz).  \\n\nPeople from the El Combate community in barrio Boquerón are known as mata con hacha (\"those who kill with axes\") based on folklore about a fight over the salinas , where those from Cabo Rojo fought with axes against people from the adjacent town of Lajas. Because the people from Lajas apparently fought back by throwing stones they are known as tira piedras (\"those who throw stones\").  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In Lajas, over 270 residences lost their roofs. The hurricane destroyed Lajas\\' pineapple industry.  \\n\nGeography\nLajas is located on the southern coast.

The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth.

The cross is surrounded by eleven gold stars; five in the top  part and six in the lower part of the cross, in the form of a circle.  \\n\nIt is gold with a green band crossing it diagonally right to left; gold stands for the wealth of the land and green for the beauty of the valley, which is a gift from mother nature to Lajas.

In the top left there is a red cardinal\\'s hat and in the bottom a red anchor with green; the shield has a 3 tower castle, each one with two windows and a door.
