Lechón/Leit\\xc3 3o is a word referring to a roasted baby pig (piglet) which was still fed by suckling its mother\\'s milk (a suckling pig). Lechón/Leit\\xc3 3o is a popular item in the cuisine in Los Angeles (in the United States), Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico , Honduras, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru , Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and other Spanish-speaking nations in Latin America, as well as in Portugal , Cape Verde , Angola , Mozambique and other Portuguese-speaking nations.  It is also present as cochon de lait in the French-Swiss and French cuisines (in particular in Metz ), in Italy (in particular in Sardinian cuisine as su porcheddu ) and Romania .  The dish features a whole roasted suckling pig cooked over charcoal . It has been described as a national dish of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Spain, Portugal, as well as the Philippines . However, the pig-roasting traditions of the Philippines (similar to other Austronesian regions) have native pre-colonial origins. The meaning of \"lechon\" in Filipino has diverted from the original Spanish term  to become a general term for \"roasted pig\", and is used in reference to adult roasted pigs rather than to suckling pigs, with Cebu being asserted by American chef Anthony Bourdain as having the best pigs.   \\n\nIn most of these regions, lechón/leit\\xc3 3o is prepared throughout the year for special occasions, during festivals. It is the centerpiece of the tradition Cuban Christmas feast La Noche Buena .  After seasoning, the piglet is cooked by skewering the entire animal, entrails removed, on a large stick and cooking it in a pit filled with charcoal. The piglet is placed over the charcoal, and the stick or rod it is attached to is turned in a rotisserie action.\\n\nLechona , also known as lechón asado , is a popular Colombian dish .  It is similar in style to many preparations made in other South American countries, consisting of a roasted pig stuffed with yellow peas , green onion , and spices, cooked in an outdoor brick oven for several hours. Yellow rice is sometimes added, especially in Bogotá. It is mostly traditional to the Tolima Department in central Colombia and is usually accompanied by arepas , a corn-based dough.\\n\nThe dish has been described as a national dish of Puerto Rico.  [ a ] The name of the dish in Puerto Rico is lechón asado .  It is a traditional dish served at festivals and holidays.  \\n\nIn Indonesia , roast pig (using both adult or suckling pig) is called babi guling , babi putar , babi panggang or babi bakar ; it is predominantly found in non-Muslim majority regions, such as Hindu Bali and Christian Batak lands in North Sumatra , the Minahasa people of North Sulawesi , Toraja in South Sulawesi , Papua , and also among Chinese Indonesians . In Bali, babi guling is usually served with lawar and steamed rice ; it is a popular dish in Balinese restaurants and warungs .  In the Batak people\\'s tradition, babi guling is a prerequisite in wedding offerings by the bride\\'s family. In Papua, pigs and yams are roasted in heated stones placed in a hole dug in the ground and covered with leaves; this cooking method is called bakar batu (burning the stone), and it is an important cultural and social event among Papuan people.\\n\nThe Philippines , a former Spanish colony, also has a dish that acquired the Spanish name \"lechón\" (usually spelled lechon without diacritics , but also litson or lichon ); but it differs from the Spanish lechón in that it uses adult pigs, uses different native ingredients (distinctively lemongrass , binucao fruits, tamarind , and citrus leaves), is cooked differently, and is pre-colonial in origin (natively known as inasal or inihaw [na baboy] ).    It is most similar to neighboring native dishes like the Balinese babi guling (though differing in the stuffing and spices used).   \\n\nVariants of lechón that use suckling pigs are differentiated as lechon de leche (which in Spanish would be a linguistic redundancy), but otherwise are cooked in the native way as in regular lechon.  The dish that is explicitly derived from the Spanish lechón style of cooking is known as cochinillo . Unlike native Filipino lechons which are stuffed and cooked slowly over charcoals on a bamboo spit, cochinillo uses a suckling pig that is splayed and roasted in an oven.  \\n\nThe term lechon has also become generalized as a loanword for anything spit-roasted over coals. It is also used for other Filipino dishes like lechon manok (native roasted chicken) and lechon baka (a whole cow spit-roasted Filipino-style), thus lechon made from whole pig is differentiated as \"lechon baboy\" (literally \"pig lechon\").    \\n\nIn various Chinese communities (especially in Southern China), a roast suckling pig is purchased for special family occasions, business launches, or as a ritualistic spiritual offering. For example, one tradition is to offer one or several whole roast suckling pigs to the Jade Emperor to celebrate a Chinese film\\'s opening. The pig is sacrificed to ward off evils and in prayer for the film\\'s success. One garnish used to make the dish look more appealing is a circular slice of pineapple and cherry, and is often placed in a red box for luck.\\n\nSuckling pig dishes in parts of Southeast Asia, like Singapore and Vietnam , are also influenced by ethnic Chinese cuisine. Roast suckling pig is eaten in Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants for important parties.  It is also a popular dish at wedding dinners or a party for a baby\\'s completion of its first month of life.   \\n\nThe European cuisines of Austria, Croatia, England, Georgia, Germany, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Sweden   favor the dish highly as well. It accompanies goose as the traditional Christmas feast of families in Russia and Serbia, while the Russian Navy maintains a tradition of presenting a roast piglet (or several) to the crew of a ship returning from deployment.\\n\nSuckling pig is known in German, Austrian and German-Swiss cuisines as Spanferkel and in the Dutch cuisine as speenvarken . It can be roasted in the oven  or grilled, and is often served at festive occasions such as Oktoberfest .  \\n\nIn Sweden suckling pig is called sp\\xc3 4dgris , it is usually cooked in the oven, or sometimes roasted directly over the fire. It is often stuffed with various fruits such as apples and plums, together with butter and breadcrumbs.  \\n\nThe suckling pig is used in Cajun cuisine in the southern U.S., where the Cochon de Lait Festival  is held annually in the small town of Mansura, Louisiana . During this festival, as its name implies, suckling pigs are roasted. Other uses for the suckling pig in the U.S. include slow roasting in an oven or (as in a Hawaiian-style pig roast ) in a pit. The latter remains popular in the cuisine of the Southern United States . [ citation needed ] \\n\nSee also\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links",
