In 1968, the Cultural Center was finally inaugurated.  \\n\nDon Baudilio Vega Berríos, Mayor of the city , said during its inauguration, that: \"... in fact, at all classes social-working, artisans, dependents on commerce, businessmen, industrialists, it was notable the concern towards the joy in their cultural recreational field as so many jobs in their daily lives\".  Therefore, the building was constructed for the Cultural Center of the city of Mayagüez aiming to replace the old municipal theater using modern construction techniques.  \\n\nOn September 3, 1983 being mayor of the city Benjamin Cole , the Cultural Center was dedicated in honor of Baudilio Vega.  \\nCurrently, the Cultural Center of Mayagüez houses a public library, cultural theater and tourist office as well as the Municipal Bomba School.  \\n\nReferences\n18°12\\xe2\\x80\\xb204.01\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 67°08\\xe2\\x80\\xb223.91\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 18.2011139°N 67.1399750°W ﻿ / 18.2011139; -67.1399750 \\n",
