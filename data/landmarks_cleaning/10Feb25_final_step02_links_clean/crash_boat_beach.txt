Now these piers remains are used as a fishing and recreation spot. \\n\nThe Crash Boat Beach piers / dock was originally built for use by the United States military rescue boats who raced out to sea to rescue downed airmen from Ramey Air Force Base, hence the name \" Crash boat \". As time passed, the local sea currents deposited tons of sand into the pier area forming into a beach, making it unusable to dock boats at the pier.  \\n\nCrash Boat Beach is now a tourism spot where vacationers participate in recreational activities, such as swimming, sun bathing, surfing, and snorkeling.\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links",
