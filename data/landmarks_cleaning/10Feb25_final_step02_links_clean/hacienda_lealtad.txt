A large hacienda , it was founded in 1830, by Juan Bautista Plumey, a French immigrant, who arrived in Puerto Rico with enslaved people. (Juan Bautista Plumey was born in France on September 8, 1797, and named Jean Baptiste Henri Plumey.)  \\n\nIt would become the largest coffee plantation in Lares, with over thirty slaves and hundreds of day laborers working the 69 cuerdas of coffee farm. For many years the plantation was a large producer and exporter of coffee. Day laborers , jornaleros or braceros from Lares worked in the coffee fields of the hacienda . In 1880, it was owned by  Miguel Marquez Enseñat.\\n\nIt is now owned by Edwin Soto and his family, who invested millions into its restoration and operate the hacienda as a hotel, coffee shop and a living museum recreating the historical setting of the height of coffee production in Puerto Rico. Coffee growing in Puerto Rico has seen a resurgence and Hacienda Lealtad produces coffee under the brand Café Lealtad. The Café Bistro Hacienda Lealtad on Puerto Rico Highway 128 kilometer 55.8, is where groups meet for the start of their tour of the 19th century coffee plantation.\\n\nBrief history\nLares was founded on April 26, 1827, and became an important location of coffee production in Puerto Rico. In 1830, Juan Bautista Plumey established Hacienda Lealtad, the coffee producing farm. Plumey, a French immigrant  had come to Lares with 32 slaves.  On May 20, 1833, he married Petronila Irizarry from nearby San Sebastián, Puerto Rico (Pepino) and they had twelve children.  José María Marxuach Echavarría , twice mayor of San Juan, married one of Juan Bautista Plumey daughters.\\n\nAfter Plumey established Hacienda Lealtad, it became the largest and most modern of its time given it was the first to generate its own electricity to power the hacienda\\'s machinery and mills. A canal and aqueduct guided water from the mountainside to a 17-foot hydraulic wheel that generated power to the plantation.    \\n\nBy 1846, Juan Bautista Plumey\\'s hacienda which at the time was called Hacienda La Esperanza \"was the only property registered as an hacienda in official documents. He had 69 cuerdas planted in coffee worked by 33 slaves.\"  Plumey did not allow his workers to work on other farms.   \\n\nIn 1868, Lares was the site of Grito de Lares , a two-day revolt against the crown of Spain.  While some documents state that people from Hacienda Lealtad participated in the revolt, a historian named Joseph Harrison Flores, with the National Archives of Puerto Rico, studied the history of the estate and Grito de Lares  and stated that only an eight-year-old child of a slave from Hacienda Lealtad was at the revolt, and spent 6 months in prison.\\n\nIn 1873, slavery was abolished and, \"by the 1880s coffee had replaced sugar as Puerto Rico\\'s leading export staple and principal source of wealth.\"  \\n\nIn 1880, when it was called Hacienda Paraiso, it was owned by Miguel Marquez Enseñat  who paid workers with hacienda token money , which could only be used to purchase goods from a store at the hacienda itself.  \\n\nCoffee production and exportation dropped considerably after Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States with the 1898 Treaty of Paris , and eventually, the plantation fell into disuse and decline.\\n\nThe place had sentimental value to Edwin Soto, a Puerto Rican businessman from Lares, who had picked ripe coffee beans there as a child. Soto decided he would buy the hacienda as a second home.  While Soto\\'s initial intentions for the property, when he purchased it in 2007, were to keep it as a second home he later decided to restore it for its historic importance. Soto invested millions of dollars into its restoration and Hacienda Lealtad is now a living museum, a hotel, coffee shop, offering educational tours to local and international tourists. It also serves as a place for people in the agriculture and coffee industry to meet and hold workshops.\\n\nIn 2014, the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture began an initiative to develop agricultural tourism and in 2016, Hacienda Lealtad was endorsed by the Puerto Rico Tourism Company ( Compañia de Turismo de Puerto Rico ). Since the start of its restoration Café Lealtad, Inc., as the company is called, has purchased coffee seeds and other equipment and services from the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture.   \\n\nStudents of agriculture and members of agricultural associations visit Hacienda Lealtad in groups for workshops  and as Puerto Rico continues to strengthen its agricultural industry, thirty Puerto Rican farmers completed an intensive, eight-week course on the business side of agriculture, at the hacienda.  The University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez opened an Hacienda Lealtad Café in early 2019.  \\n\nTours were underway regularly until Hurricane Maria hit on September 20, 2017. A week after a relieved Soto reported that Hurricane Irma had not done much damage to the coffee trees on the estate, Hurricane Maria destroyed all the coffee trees, around 60,000. Clean-up, restoration and planting began anew soon afterwards and tours and functions at the hacienda resumed.\\n\nA few months after Hurricane Maria struck, a meeting was held by the Secretary of Agriculture, farmers and stakeholders at Hacienda Lealtad.\\n\nAttractions\nThe 19th century, coffee farming culture of Puerto Rico where jornaleros  and slaves processed coffee for its distribution to Europe, is on display at Hacienda Lealtad. Educational tours where people can learn about coffee cultivation are available, by reservation, and the main attractions are:    \\n\nCoffee growing\nThere\\'s been a resurgence in coffee growing in Puerto Rico, despite the lack of manpower and other challenges facing coffee farm landowners.  Hacienda Lealtad in Lares has a coffee shop called Café Bistro Hacienda Lealtad. Café Lareño Coffee Shop is nearby and other such chic coffee shops have opened up along the mountainous hilltops of Lares and other municipalities in Puerto Rico.  Lares has been the Puerto Rican municipality with the largest emigration to the mainland United States, since being hit by a severe economic recession.  \\n\nIn media and popular culture\nThe dress worn by Keysi Vargas, Puerto Rican contestant in the 2015 Miss World Beauty pageant, represented Hacienda Lealtad coffee.   \\n\nIn 2015, a made-for-television movie , La Cenicienta Boricua (Puerto Rican Cinderella) was filmed at Hacienda Lealtad   and released on Telemundo .  \\n\nGallery\nScenes around Hacienda Lealtad:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links",
