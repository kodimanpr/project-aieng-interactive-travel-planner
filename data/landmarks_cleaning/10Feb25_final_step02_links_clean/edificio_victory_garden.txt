It was deemed notable as \"one of Puerto Rico\\'s finest examples of Spanish Revival apartment houses from the early 20th century.\"  \\n\nThe building was designed by Pedro Adolfo de Castro y Besosa (January 5, 1895-October, 1936), the first United States university-trained Puerto Rican architect.  : 16 He designed 33 or more apartment houses during 1929-1936. Rafael Carmoega emerged to higher prominence only after de Castro\\'s early death, at age 41.  : 17 \\n\nAlthough it appears massive, the building\\'s footprint only uses up 30 percent of the lot\\'s area.  It is U-shaped with a courtyard not visible from the corner of the streets.  \\n\nReferences\n\\n\nThis article about a property in Puerto Rico on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub .
