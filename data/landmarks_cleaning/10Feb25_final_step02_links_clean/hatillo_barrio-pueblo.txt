The church was built between 1824 and 1830. It sustained damage during the 1918 San Fermín earthquake . A concrete roof, tower and dome were added in 1930.  \\n\nHistory\nHatillo barrio-pueblo was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States .
