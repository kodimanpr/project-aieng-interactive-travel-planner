Its population in 2010 was 1,064.     \\n\nAs was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.   \\n\nHistory\nCidra barrio-pueblo was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Cidra Pueblo was 1,034.  \\n \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nLocated across from the central plaza is the Parroquia Nuestra Señora del Carmen (English: Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish), a Roman Catholic church. The first church made of wood was built in 1815. In 1867, a second church was built but was destroyed by an earthquake soon after. Pedro Cobreros designed the next church which was built in 1895. The current structure with a new facade was completed in 1952 and the lateral naves were added at that time.  \\n\nSectors\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nThe following sectors are in Cidra barrio-pueblo:  \\n\nBarriada Ferrer,\\nDomingo Rodríguez,\\nEl Cielito,\\nFernández,\\nFerrer,\\nFreire,\\nJardines de Cidra,\\nLa Cuatro,\\nLos Almendros,\\nPráxedes Santiago,\\nSamuel Quiles,\\nSanta Teresita , and Villa del Carmen .\\n\nSee also\nReferences",
