The church is listed in the Inventory of the Historic Churches of Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones and the United States National Register of Historic Places due to its architectural and historical significance.    \\n\nThe church was designed in 1866 by Onofre Llorapart and built in stages between 1872 and 1878 in the main town square ( plaza pública ) of Utuado, on its east-facing block that it currently shares with the parish house ( casa parroquial ) and its adjacent Catholic school. This urban setting is highly traditional of the historic downtowns ( pueblos ) of Puerto Rico. The exterior and fa\\xc3 7ade of the building showcase the traditional Spanish Colonial architecture of the 19th-century contemporary churches of Puerto Rico with elements inspired in Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture . With the exception of routine renovations and the removal of the Renaissance-style side pillars and arcades of the church in 1965, the building is well preserved and has never suffered from integrity-endangering modifications.  \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\n\\n\nThis article on a Catholic church building is a stub .
