Its population in 2010 was 6,685.     \\n\nDue to its historical value, the historic downtown district ( pueblo ) of Coamo was added to the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones  on July 19, 1995.  \\n\nAs was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.   \\n \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place in the barrio-pueblo for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nLocated across the central plaza in Coamo barrio-pueblo is the Parroquia San Blas de Illescas , a Roman Catholic church.   \\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\\n\nThis Coamo, Puerto Rico location article is a stub .
