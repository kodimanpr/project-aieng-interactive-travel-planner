Originally, Plaza Río Hondo had a \"large box\" look. The owner characterized the mall as looking like a factory. The goal of this renovation was, to quote the owner, \"to break out of the box.\" The new look which brought forth the remodeling of both the exterior and interior of the mall, consisted of a river theme throughout the whole mall featuring bright, tropical colors, suggesting the tropical landscape and seascape of Puerto Rico. This encouraged the tenants to renovate their own spaces. The center was re-merchandised to meet the needs of all kinds of consumer budgets. Among the new stores were Bostonian, Payless Shoe Source , a bookstore, a GNC Nutrition store, an upscale men\\'s clothing store, and kiosks for cellular telephones, candy and jewelry. Plaza Río Hondo remained open for business during its fast-track construction schedule, which allowed the renovation to be substantially complete for the 1994 Christmas season. These renovations would be fully complete by February 1995. By then the 425,000 square foot mall, would be anchored by a 92,000 square foot Kmart , a 36,000 square foot Woolworth , a 19,700 square foot La Giralda, and a 9,000 square foot Walgreens as a junior anchor.  \\n\nIn 1996, the International Council of Shopping Centers awarded Plaza Río Hondo with the \"International Design and Development Award\" for its layout and style, this was given to the mall after the major renovations it had in 1994 into 1995.   \\n\nIn 1997, the Woolworth store at the mall closed after the chain went under that year.  \\n\nIn late 1998, management Yebba Realty Ventures at the time purchased the lease from F.W.

Shortly after the acquisition a long-time tenant, with considerable lease term remaining and a store occupying some 20,000 square feet at the center of the mall began to experience financial difficulties, management immediately entered into negotiations to purchase the lease, which they were able to do for $600,000. A 12-unit food court plus 2 outside facing retail bays were complete at a total cost of approximately $3,645,000. The first year net income generated from the food court was approximately $1,112,280. The total cost of the lease buy-out and food court construction was approximately $4,245,000 thereby equating to a yield on investment of 26.2%.
