It has hosted a number of international musicians as students as well as faculty, and has a longstanding relationship with the classical music movement in Puerto Rico, including the annual Casals Festival and the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra (PRSO).\\n\nHistory\nFollowing the success of the Casals Festival held in San Juan in 1957, state legislator Ernesto Ramos Antonini proposed several laws which would create the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra that same year, and the Conservatory of Music in June 1959. The conservatory was originally envisioned as a school for preparing musicians for the PRSO and for preparing music teachers for the state public education system. Throughout the years, however, the conservatory has become a musical landmark in the Caribbean, providing advanced academic studies in various music areas to local students as well as international visitors.\\n\nSince its inception, the conservatory has been under the administration of state government agencies, including the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company ( Compañía de Fomento Económico ), the Administration for the Encouragement of Arts and Culture ( Administración para el Fomento de las Artes y Cultura ), and the Musical Arts Corporation ( Corporación de las Artes Musicales , or CAM). It remained a part of the CAM until 1995 when a state law granted it fiscal and administrative autonomy. Since then, the conservatory has been autonomously run by a board of trustees appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate.\\n\nAcademics\nThe conservatory offers a variety of post-secondary degrees in music, the post-graduate program offers bachelor\\'s degrees in: musical composition , music education , voice , classical guitar , symphony instruments, jazz , Caribbean music , and piano .

These programs do not offer degrees or certifications, but provide basic to near expert level teaching to regular citizens who are not in its formal academic program.\\n\nThe conservatory is accredited by various federal and state educational associations, including:\\n\nCampus\nFrom 1960 to 2008 the Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music was located in Hato Rey , in the former facilities of an old factory .
