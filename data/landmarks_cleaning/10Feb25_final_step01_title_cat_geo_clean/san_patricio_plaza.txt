The mall is located at the intersection of PR-2 , PR-23 , and PR-20 , and has over 120 stores with its anchors being T.J. Maxx , Capri, Walgreens , PetSmart , Caribbean Cinemas and Office Depot , and Burlington , plus an outdoor shopping area known as \"Liberty Square\".\\n\nHistory\nDuring the Spanish Colonial period, Tomás O\\'Daly was granted land in the vicinity of Guaynabo and O\\'Daly developed it into a thriving sugar hacienda. O\\'Daly and fellow Irishman Miguel Kirwan became business partners in the \"Hacienda San Patricio\" which they named after the chief patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick . The plantation no longer exists. The land on which it was located is now a suburb called San Patricio with a shopping mall, San Patricio Plaza.  \\n\nOn December 14, 1963, while construction started in November 1963, it was officially announced by the president of San Patricio Shopping Center, Inc., James J. Wilson, that arrangements had been finalized for the $3,000,000 financing of the shopping center. Short-term financing for the project was provided by Banco Popular while the State Mutual of America Insurance Company of America was in charge of long-term financing. The shopping center, being located at the corner of San Patricio and F. D. Roosevelt avenues, would be planned to have several establishments. Among those establishments there would be: a Pueblo supermarket , a New York Department Stores ; a Kmart discount department store , a Banco Popular , a Thom McAn shoe store , a Walgreens , a Lerner Shops , and a Swiss Chalet restaurant . Pueblo, Kmart, and New York Department Stores, were planned to be the first to open.   \\n\nOn August 14, 1964, the eleventh Pueblo supermarket inaugurated at the shopping center. It was said to be the biggest location in the chain at the time, being 16,000 square feet.  \\n\nOn October 21, 1964, the Kmart inaugurated at the shopping center with a 69,000 square foot store. It was the chains first store out of the continental North America.   \\nOn November 17, 1964, Lerner Shops inaugurated at the shopping center, this store joined the 337 stores the chain had in Puerto Rico and the United States at the time.  \\n\nOn November 27, 1964, the New York Department Stores inaugurated at the shopping center.  \\n\nOn December 3, 1964, developed by Interstate General Corporation, with Theodore Berenson administrating the shopping center, San Patricio Plaza was officially inaugurated. It opened with 16 establishments, 250 square feet of retail space, and parking for 1,500 vehicles. It was anchored by Kmart , New York Department Stores , Pueblo supermarket , and a Walgreens . Additionally out of those 16 establishments it had places such as Lerner Shops , Giusti, Thom McAn , Clubman, Rudes Decorators, Gordon\\'s Jewelers , Bithorn Travel Agency, Park Avenue Gift Shop, Metalfraft Furniture Store, San Patricio Sports, and others. The cost of the entire shopping center exceeded $8 million, it was designed by architect Summer Scheim. The 20-acre estate where the building was located belonged to the Gonzalez Giusti family, one of whose members, Mr. William Preston Giusti, was vice president of the San Patricio Plaza Association. Walgreens inaugurated their 481 store in the chain, being the third store on the island at the time.   \\n\nDuring the night of December 31, 1967, a fire consumed the building where Kmart was located and left it completely destroyed. The fire, which caused an estimated loss of $1.5 million, started in some boxes and sheets of cardboard partitioning walls behind the store outside the building. Gordon\\'s Jewelers , which was located next to the Kmart , suffered minor damage and thanks to the prompt intervention of firefighters, the flames did not cross a wall that divided that store from the damaged Kmart building. As a result, after this event, the mall\\'s management decided to enclose the facilities, adding a lower basement level with new stores which would bring the consumer at the time more alternatives to shopping at the center.   \\n\nOn January 30, 1969, Kmart re-inaugurated their store at the mall after the fires that had occurred.  \\n\nIn the 1970s, taking into account the economic conditions of the period in terms of high interest rates and oil costs, Interstate General Corporation decided to sell certain properties, including San Patricio Plaza, which was sold to the González Giusti family.  \\n\nOn June 18, 1977, a Baskin Robbins opened a location on the mall premises next to the then Felicilandia amusement center.  \\n\nIn December 1978, the mall had establishments such as La Cobacha, Caribbean Music, Super Pet Center, Carrousel, Parklane Hosiery, Kress, Amado Beauty Salón, Candyland, and others.  \\n\nIn 1982, the Felicilandia amusement center located on the mall premises would receive $1,000,000 renovations.

The first phase of this project, consisted of eight stores that had an established clientele, including Sterling House, Kitchen Craft, and Marisol Freyre. The first level was dedicated to shops and the second level provided office spaces. The construction of this shopping center was carried out by remodeling of an old warehouse located behind the famous Felicilandia amusement park and was carried out by the firm Carrerá Arquitectos.  \\n\nIn 1994, the first expansion of Galería San Patricio was completed, this included the two floors of the wing where Uno Chicago Grill was located. With the creation of this new area, and in addition to Uno, came four additional stores, among them the then existing \"Bath, Dreams, And\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\" store.  \\n\nIn 1994, the mall changed its logo once again, the mall was given a $43 million dollar renovation and expansion, which included the addition of a food court which opened the same year.

It closed in June 2023 after the company declared bankruptcy alongside its other stores.\\n\nIn 2008, a Circuit City store opened at the mall, being the first of the chain on the island. The store, which opened with 28,000 square feet of space, was located in the area of the east facade, where the then new Walgreens pharmacy was located. It later closed in early 2009 after it declared bankruptcy.  \\n\nIn 2010, a TJ Maxx would come to fill the 28,000 square feet of space left by Circuit City . PetSmart would also open a 24,000 square foot location at the mall this year.  \\n\nOn August 28, 2012, San Patricio Plaza announced a renovation of its Food Court, pedestrian bridge and multifloor parking.

A replica of the mall\\'s original sign was created for the exhibition, which was later moved to the pedestrian bridge in 2016.  The exhibit partially closed in 2015. Visitors could still see the history showcase until 2018, when the remains of the exhibit were removed in favor of a larger AT&T location.\\n\nOn January 12, 2017, it was announced that the mall would undergo a $4 million renovation in order to look more modern. It included a new fountain, a new central atrium, new stairs, replacement of flooring and ceiling, exterior improvements, and more.
