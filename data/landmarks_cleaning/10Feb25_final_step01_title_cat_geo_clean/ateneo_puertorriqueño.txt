Founded on April 30, 1876,  it has been called Puerto Rico\\'s oldest cultural institution,  however, it is actually its third oldest overall and second culturally, after the Bar Association of Puerto Rico  and the Casino of Mayagüez.  \\n\nOne of its founders was the playwright, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera .  The Athenaeum was the first to give accolades and awards to artists and writers such as José Gautier Benítez , José de Diego , Manuel María Sama, Francisco Oller , Manuel Fernández Juncos , Lola Rodríguez de Tió and Luis Lloréns Torres .  \\n\nThe Athenaeum serves as a museum , school , library , and performance hall for the arts in Puerto Rico. It hosts a number of contests, conferences, and exhibits each year, presenting Puerto Rican art, literature, and music.   Since 1937 the use of the spaces of the Athenaeum has been limited to activities it sponsors.  Its headquarters are located in Puerta de Tierra , adjacent to Old San Juan , in a strip that also houses the \" Casa de España \", the Carnegie Library , the Capitol complex and the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee headquarters.  \\n\nHistory\nThe Atheaneaum was founded on Sunday, April 30, 1876 at San Juan City Hall .  One of its founders was the playwright, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera .  The Athenaeum was the first to give accolades and awards to artists and writers such as José Gautier Benítez , José de Diego , Manuel María Sama, Francisco Oller , Manuel Fernández Juncos , Lola Rodríguez de Tió and Luis Lloréns Torres .  \\n\nNilita Vientós Gastón became its first female president in 1946 and was the incumbent until 1961.  In 1976 the Athenaeum celebrated its centennial with Eladio Rodríguez Otero at the helm as president, who gave a speech in presence of the then governor Rafael Hernández Colón , Hiram Torres Rigual , in representation of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , and former governor Luis A. Ferré .  To commemorate the event, the Athenaeum also commissioned a medal to be awarded to those who represent \"the highest national values expressed through [Puerto Rican] culture .\" The Centennial Medal of the Puerto Rican Athenaeum was most recently awarded to the musical salsa group El Gran Combo .  \\n\nThe Athenaeum Building\nIn 1922 the Aguadillan architect, Francisco Roldán Arce was asked to draw up plans for the present building. The cornerstone was laid on 27 May 1923 in the presence of José Coll y Cuchi .  The architecture of the building, Spanish Morisco, was introduced to Puerto Rico by Pedro de Castro , who also built some of the structures that neighbor close by. De Castro\\'s tropical and mediterranean conscience objected to the architecture imported from the north, giving preference to the luminosity of the Caribbean, to the visual continuity of the spaces, to the galleries and balconies that served as a transition between interior and exterior spaces, shaped by the urban environment, the countryside or the inner courtyards.  \\n\nThe Athenaeum Art Gallery\nThe Athenaeum\\'s pride is its gallery of art, which consists of 459 artworks.  Among the artworks held at the Atheneum one of its most recognizable is Francisco Oller\\'s 1890 painting \" La Escuela del Maestro Rafael Cordero \".

The Experimental Theatre Hall, which has capacity for 200, has been the premiere of many works that are now considered classical Puerto Rican drama. The most well-known of these is René Marqués\\' La Carreta , which premiered in 1953 under the patronage of the Athenaeum. Other dramatists of note whose work has also premiered have been Manuel Méndez Ballester , Francisco Arriví , Luis Rafael Sánchez and Myrna Casa .  \\n\nStarted in the 1970s, the Theatre Festivals of the Puerto Rican Athenaeum with the intent of showcasing new works, both Puerto Rican, as well as of foreign extraction.
