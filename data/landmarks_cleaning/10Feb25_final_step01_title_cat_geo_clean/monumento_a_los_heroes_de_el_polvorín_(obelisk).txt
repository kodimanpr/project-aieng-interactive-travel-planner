The fire started at the horse barn of the recently deployed U.S. Army artillery encampment one block from the center of town, on Calle Salud between Calle Cristina and Calle Comercio, and quickly spread towards the army\\'s artillery munitions storage area.  By the time the local commander realized there was a fire near the munitions compound, he judged it too risky for his men to try to put it out and ordered all personnel to move away from the area to let the fire extinguish itself, even if it meant explosions at the munitions depot. The commander also instructed the local firemen (then numbering about 40) not to enter the area or attempt to extinguish the fire. However, seven of the firemen and one civilian disobeyed the orders of the commander and decided to fight the fire. They were able to suppress the fire before it could get to the gunpowder reserves, without any loss of life or additional loss of property. Due to their efforts, disaster upon the then mostly wooden homes and businesses in town was averted. For their success, the group was honored many times both in Ponce and the rest of Puerto Rico. The obelisk was built to honor their memory.  \\n\nThe structure\nThe obelisk was built in 1948.  It replaced the original obelisk built shortly after the 25 January 1899 fire, but which was destroyed by the 1918 San Fermín earthquake .  The obelisk was erected by a city board consisting of Jaime L. Drew , Antonio Arias , and Antonio Mirabal .  This monument is different from the obelisk/tomb built in 1911 , and dedicated to the same men, and which stands at the Cementerio Civil de Ponce (Ponce Civil Cemetery).   \\n\nThe four-sided obelisk has four plaques, one on each side.\\n\nThe plaque facing East reads:\\n\nThe North-facing plaque lists the honored men, saying:\\n\nThe Western-facing plaque says:\\n\nThe plaque facing South reads: \\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n\\n",
