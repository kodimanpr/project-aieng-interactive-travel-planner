It crosses the Martín Peña Channel in San Juan, Puerto Rico .\\n\nIt was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2008.  \\n\nHistory\nThe original Martín Peña Bridge was simply a stone causeway probably built around the mid-1500s. Later, a wooden bridge was built on top of the causeway, which was in turn replaced by a brick edification in 1784. This bridge, designed by Juan Francisco Mestre, was destroyed by the British during Ralph Abercromby \\'s invasion of Puerto Rico . After this, the bridge was rebuilt in 1846 with a design by engineer Santiago Cortijo. This new bridge measured 220 feet long and 6 meters wide, and was composed of nine elliptical arches.  \\n\nAccording to a book by Luis Pumarada and Maria de los Angeles Castro, the name of Martín Peña comes from a fisherman who operated a cove near the area.  \\n\nGallery\nReferences\n\\n\nThis article about a property in Puerto Rico on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub .
