Its population in 2010 was 435.     \\n\nAs was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.   \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nLocated across from the central plaza in Barceloneta barrio-pueblo is the Parroquia Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen (Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish). The first church was made of masonry but with a wooden roof. Inaugurated around 1881, it was destroyed by Hurricane San Felipe in 1928. The current church was built in 1930 and was most likely designed by Luis Perocier. It has been renovated and enlarged since its inauguration.  \\n\nHistory\nBarceloneta barrio-pueblo was in Spain\\'s gazetteers  until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Barceloneta barrio was 1,459.  \\n \\n\nGallery\nPlaces in Barceloneta barrio-pueblo:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links",
