It is home to the Leones de Ponce team of the Puerto Rico Baseball League (LBPPR) and FC Leones of the Puerto Rico Soccer League (PRSL). The stadium has a capacity of 16,000 seats.    Construction of the stadium began in 1947 and it opened on 15 October 1949.  Montaner is the first stadium in Puerto Rico with an artificial surface field.   The stadium lies next to the Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium , where the Ponce Lions (basketball) hold their games. The Stadium was named to honor Francisco \"Paquito\" Montaner , one of the greatest Puerto Rican pitchers of all times.  \\n\nHistory\nWhile baseball had been practiced in the city prior to this, baseball in Ponce started in earnest upon the arrival of Americans to the island after the Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93American War of 1898.  The first non-professional baseball leagues played at Campo Atlético Charles H. Terry . After the formation of the Liga de Béisbol Semiprofesional de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Semiprofessional Baseball League) in 1938,  the sport had matured enough that it became necessary to consider building a new stadium. This need was strengthened on 14 September 1941 when the league became professional-level.  Construction of the stadium began in 1947 and it opened two years later on 15 October 1949.  In addition to baseball, the stadium was also used for basketball games. These were played on a convertible basketball court that was stowed away when the basketball games were over.  has killed?\\n\nUses\nThe PRPBL\\'s regular playing season runs from November through January. From February to August, the venue is transformed into a track and field stadium, and also serves as a venue for other activities such as a host of the Mustang Auto Daredevils. It has also been used for intramural competitions and other academic sporting events.  The track is completely covered during baseball season and then it is elevated via a hydraulic system for the track and field events.\\n\nThe stadium is also used for winter training by many United States Major Baseball League players.  In its early days, in particular, the stadium was used as the winter training stadium by the New York Yankees . In 1947, the game at the opening day of training was won 12 to 8 by the Leones de Ponce [ a ] v. New York Yankees.  News of the event first broke at the New York Daily News , followed by The New York Herald and The New York Times .   \\n\nMajor events\nMontaner has seen a total of 12 championships: four in BSN basketball (1952, 1961, 1964 y 1965), one in Double A (AA) baseball in 1957, six in Professional Baseball (68-69, 69-70, 71-72, 81-82, 03-04 and 08-09), and one in football in 2007.  \\n\nMontaner has also seen some great events in athletics. The Primeros Juegos Ponceños , the Frankie Colón Memorial, the Justas Intercolegiales (intercollegiate games), the Central American and Caribbean Games (\"Ponce 93\"), and the Iberoamerican Games, all took place here. There have also been athletics competitions at the Masters category and, more recently, the famed Ponce Grand Prix .  \\n\nFor many years Montaner was the venue of the finals of the Guantes Dorados de Boxeo Aficionado ( Amateur Boxing \\'s Golden Gloves), national as well as U.S.-based Professional Wrestling billboards , bull runs, concerts by internationally renowned artists, as well as the site of various major religious conventions.  In February 1958, evangelist Billy Graham hosted a religious event at this stadium.  \\n\nProminent Sportsmen at Montaner\nThrough Montaner, Ponce has been able to see prominent figures in the world of sports such as Francisco \\'Pancho\\' Coímbre , Felo Guilbe , Tomás \\'Planchardón\\' Quiñones, Luis Rodríguez Olmo , \\'Canena\\' Márquez , Carlos Bernier, José Guillermo \\'Pantalones\\' Santiago , Luis \\'Tite\\' Arroyo , Víctor Pellot , Roberto Clemente , Orlando \\'Peruchín\\' Cepeda , Willie Mays , Hank Aaron , Frank Robinson , José Rafael \\'Palillo\\' Santiago , Steve Carlton , John Boozer , Otoniel Vélez Franceschi , Roberto Alomar , Sandy Alomar Sr. , José \\'Cheo\\' Cruz , Rickey Henderson , José \\'Pepe\\' Mangual , Luis \\'Mambo\\' De León, Joey Cora , Juan \\'Igor\\' González , José Vidro , Iván Rodríguez , José Molina , Raúl Casanova , Javier López , and Javier Vázquez .
