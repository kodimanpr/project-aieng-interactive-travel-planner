Its population in 2010 was 3,627.     \\n\nAs was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.   \\n\nThe central plaza and its church\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies , Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza\\'s purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) , and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors . These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.  \\n\nLocated across the central plaza in Aguadilla barrio-pueblo is the Parroquia San Carlos Borromeo, a Roman Catholic church. Its construction began in 1776 and was completed in 1783. It was remodeled in 1855. One of its towers collapsed during the 1918 San Fermín earthquake and the facade was changed when reconstructed. Its last remodeling was in 1971. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1984.   \\n\nLandmarks and places of interest\nSectors\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English).
