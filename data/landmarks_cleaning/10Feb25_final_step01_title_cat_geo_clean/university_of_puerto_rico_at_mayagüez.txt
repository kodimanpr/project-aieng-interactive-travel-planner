UPRM is the second-largest university campus of the University of Puerto Rico system. In addition to its status as a land-grant university, it is also a member of the sea-grant and space-grant research consortia. In 2009, the campus population was composed of 12,108 students, 1,924 regular staff members, and 1,037 members of the education staff.  In 2013, the student population remained relatively steady at 11,838, but the instructional faculty dropped to 684.  In the second semester of 2019 around 12,166 students were enrolled.  By the end of the academic year 2022-2023 there were 10,071 students enrolled.  UPRM has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since 1946.\\n\nHistory\nThe University of Puerto Rico was created by an act of the Legislative Assembly on March 12, 1903, emerging as an outgrowth of the Normal School, which had been established three years earlier to train teachers for the Puerto Rican school system. In 1908, the benefits of the Morill-Nelson Act declared applicable to the island, fostered the rapid growth of the university. Evidence of that growth was the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts at Río Piedras in 1910 and the College of Agriculture at Mayagüez in 1911 as a land-grant university .  \\n\nThe founding of the institution is credited to D.W. May (Director of the Federal Experiment Station), José de Diego and Carmelo Alemar.  In 1912 the name of the institution was changed to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts or Colegio de Agricultura y Artes Mecánicas (CAAM).  \\n\nIn 1918, an earthquake and a fire caused significant damage to the institution. The ruins of the entrance of one of the buildings, Degetau Hall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which not only withstood the earthquake, but proved to be almost indestructible after the rebuilt hall was torn down in the late 1950s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would later become the emblem of the institution. In 1988, the archway (the portico ) was rebuilt, landscaped and turned into a monument.   \\n\nThe campus rectory was located at the José de Diego building , the oldest standing edification within the campus, built in 1911. The building was inscribed in the National Historic Building Registry as an architectural patrimony. In 1940, a clock tower was built into the main building. In 1993, the building underwent a restoration.  \\n\nIn 1929, the Liga Atlética Interuniversitaria was created at the Mayagüez campus. The LAI is an athletic organization, similar to the NCAA , created with the purpose of promoting and regulating sports activities. It originally consisted of a three event competition: basketball, baseball and track and field. Currently the competition consists of more than 25 sports.\\n\nIn 1942 as a result of university reform, the campus was organized with a considerable degree of autonomy into the Colleges of Agriculture , Engineering , and Science under the direction of a vice-chancellor . In the 1950s the institution saw more programs added when the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Nuclear Center were established.\\n\nThe Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly reorganized the University of Puerto Rico\\'s system in 1966. This reorganization of the system lead to the controversial change of its name to University of Puerto Rico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mayagüez Campus, which is used in the present day as the official name of the institution.  \\n\nIn 2007, 35.4% of all Engineering degrees were granted to women at UPRM, one of the largest percentages in US universities.  The University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez is the second largest Hispanic-serving institution in the United States.\\n\nIn 2010 the campus went on strike as part of the 2010\\xe2\\x80\\x932011 University of Puerto Rico strikes . In 2017 in response to budget cuts to the university system by the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico the campus students voted to join the University of Puerto Rico strikes, 2017 .\\n\nOrganization\nUPRM consists of the Colleges of Agricultural Sciences , Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, Engineering , and the Division of Continuing Education and Professional Studies. The College of Agricultural Sciences includes the Agricultural Experiment Station.\\n\nThe Administrative board of the Mayagüez Campus consists of the chancellor as presiding officer, the deans , two academic senators elected among those faculty members of the senate who are not ex officio , senators, and an elected student representative. The president of the university serves as an ex officio member. The board acts as an advisory body to the chancellor, prepares the development plan of the campus, approves the proposed budget prepared by the chancellor, and grants tenure, promotions and leaves of absence.\\n\n\\xc2\\xa7 Interim chancellor later made permanent\\n\nThe Academic Senate at UPRM is composed of the members of the administrative board, the director of the library, the director of the counseling office, representatives elected from the faculties whose total must not be less than twice the number of the elected ex officio members, an elected member of the Library and Counseling Office, and ten student representatives. The academic senate is the official forum of the academic community. Its main task is to participate in the formulation of academic processes within the university\\'s legal structure.\\n  \\n\nCampus\nThe UPR-Mayagüez campus encompasses approximately 315 acres (1.27 km2). The campus has a sports complex that includes a gym, a weight room, rooms for dance/aerobic classes, courts for basketball, a tennis and volleyball complex, a natatorium, an outdoor sports field and the Rafael A. Mangual Coliseum. The Hotel Colegial serves as the only on-campus dorms and is reserved for athletes. The campus offers two cafeterias, a bookstore, a Popular Bank branch,  a lounge called La Cueva de Tarzán (Tarzan\\'s cave) and a computer center, although several academic departments also operate their own computer laboratories. In 2016 after more than a decade in planning MUSA, a museum of art, was inaugurated on the campus.  In 2019 a new cafe was opened in the College of Business Administration.  The campus also contains the ruins of a historic structure called La Casilla del Caminero .\\n\nThe Mayagüez Campus General Library serves the campus community as well as residents of Mayagüez.\\n\nAcademics\nThe University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez consists of four major colleges:\\n\nUPRM offers 55 bachelor\\'s programs, 44 master\\'s programs, and 9 doctoral programs.
