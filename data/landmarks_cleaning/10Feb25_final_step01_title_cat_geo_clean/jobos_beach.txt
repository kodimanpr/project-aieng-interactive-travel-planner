While popular, the beach is dangerous and signs warning tourists of dangerous currents were installed in early 2021.  \\n\nJobos Beach is known as a world-class surf spot   and a good place to party .  In February 2013, the beach hosted the Rip Curl Pro , a world tour surfing competition.  Jobos is also a popular beach for windsurfing.
