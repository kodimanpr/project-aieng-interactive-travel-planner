It\\'s the only medical school in the University of Puerto Rico System .  It is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). Its students are predominantly Puerto Rican residents. However, anyone is allowed to apply to this university. It is also considered the top bilingual medical school in the world due to its requirement for each admitted student to fully master both English and Spanish.\\n\nHistory\nIn the nineteenth century, major health problems affected the Puerto Rican population. Anemia, malnutrition and parasitism were some of the most common conditions in children and adults. With the arrival of U.S. troops in 1898, the need for effective health plans to serve the population became a priority. With the change of sovereignty, anemia commissions were established in Puerto Rico. Thus began the development of what would become the Institute of Tropical Medicine, which was formalized in 1912.\\n\nA consolidation of the former Institute of Tropical Medicine and other entities led in 1926 to the formation of the School of Tropical Medicine. Funds from Columbia University were used for the training of different health professionals in the island. At the same time, the school\\'s professors conducted studies in collaboration with Columbia University physicians on tropical diseases hitherto of unknown etiology, or of high prevalence morbidity and mortality in Puerto Rico. In 1946 following the end of World War II, Columbia University canceled the money sent to the Medical School, which led to its closure. The legislature authorized a School of Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico, into which the School of Tropical Medicine was integrated.\\n\nThe need for a State Medical School led in 1950 to the creation of the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine as part of the University of Puerto Rico System , thanks to efforts made by the lawyer and first president of the University, Jaime Benitez . It began with an enrollment of 52 students. The school received its accreditation on 20 April 1954. In 1960, the University established a graduate program, [ which? ] unique [ why? ] in Puerto Rico, along with other [ which? ] medical services and research.
