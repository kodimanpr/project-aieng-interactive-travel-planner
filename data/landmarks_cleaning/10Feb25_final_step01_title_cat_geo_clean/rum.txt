    "main_content": "Contents\nRum\n\\n\nRum is a liquor made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice . The distillate, a clear liquid, is often aged in barrels of oak . Rum originated in the Caribbean in the 17th century, but today it is produced in nearly every major sugar-producing region of the world, such as the Philippines , where Tanduay Distillers , the largest producer of rum worldwide, has its headquarters.    \\n\nRums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails , whereas \"golden\" and \"dark\" rums were typically consumed straight or neat , iced (\" on the rocks \"), or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are made to be consumed either straight or iced.\\n\nRum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland , in Canada. It has associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog ) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo ). [ citation needed ] Rum has served as a medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery via triangular trade , organized crime, and military insurgencies such as the American Revolution and the Australian Rum Rebellion .\\n\nEtymology\nThe origin of the word \"rum\" is unclear. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that it is related to \"rumbullion\", a beverage made from boiling sugar cane stalks,  or possibly \"rumbustion,\" which was a slang word for \"uproar\" or \"tumult\";  a noisy uncontrollable exuberance,  though the origin of those words and the nature of the relationship are unclear.    Both words surfaced in English about the same time as rum did (1651 for \"rumbullion\", and before 1654 \"rum\").  \\n\nThere have been various other theories:\\n\nRegardless of the original source, the name was already in common use by 1654, when the General Court of Connecticut ordered the confiscations of \"whatsoever Barbados liquors, commonly called rum, kill the devil and the like\".  A short time later in May 1657, the General Court of Massachusetts also decided to make illegal the sale of strong liquor \"whether knowne by the name of rumme, strong water, wine, brandy, etc\".  \\n\nIn current usage, the name used for a rum is often based on its place of origin.\\n\nFor rums from places mostly in Latin America where Spanish is spoken, the word ron is used. A ron añejo (\"aged rum\") is a premium spirit.\\n\nRhum is the term that typically distinguishes rum made from fresh sugar cane juice from rum made from molasses in French-speaking locales like Martinique.  A rhum vieux (\"old rum\") is an aged French rum that meets several other requirements.\\n\nSome of the many other names for rum are Nelson \\'s blood, kill-devil, demon water, pirate\\'s drink, navy neater, and Barbados water.  \\nA version of rum from Newfoundland is referred to by the name screech , while some low-grade West Indies rums are called tafia .  \\n\nHistory\nMany historians now believe that rum-making found its way to the Caribbean islands along with sugarcane and its cultivation methods from Brazil.  \\nThe traditional history of modern-style rum tells of its invention in the Caribbean, in the 17th century, by slaves on sugarcane plantations, who discovered that molasses , a by-product of the sugar refining process, could be fermented into alcohol, and then distilled.\\nThe earliest record, in a 1651 document from Barbados, mentions the island of Nevis in particular:  \\n\n\"The chief fuddling they make in the island is Rumbullion, alias Kill-Divil, and this is made of sugar canes distilled, a hot, hellish, and terrible liquor.\"\nBy the late 17th century rum had replaced French brandy as the exchange alcohol of choice in the triangle trade . Canoemen and guards on the African side of the trade, who had previously been paid in brandy, were now paid in rum.  \\n\nAfter the development of rum in the Caribbean, the drink\\'s popularity spread to Colonial North America . To support the demand for the drink, the first rum distillery in the Thirteen Colonies was set up in 1664 on Staten Island . Boston, Massachusetts , had a distillery three years later.  The manufacture of rum became early colonial New England\\'s largest and most prosperous industry.  New England became a distilling center due to the technical, metalworking and cooperage skills and abundant lumber; the rum produced there was lighter, more like whiskey. Much of the rum was exported, and distillers in Newport of Rhode Island even made an extra strong rum specifically to be used as a slave currency.  Rhode Island rum even joined gold as an accepted currency in Europe for a period of time.  While New England triumphed in price and consistency, Europeans still viewed the best rums as coming from the Caribbean.  Estimates of rum consumption in the American colonies before the American Revolutionary War had every man, woman, or child drinking an average of 3 imperial gallons (14 L ) of rum each year.  \\n\nIn the 18th century, ever increasing demands for sugar, molasses, rum, and slaves led to a feedback loop that intensified the triangular trade.  When France banned the production of rum in their New World possessions to end the domestic competition with brandy, New England distillers were then able to undercut producers in the British West Indies by buying cut-rate molasses from French sugar plantations. The outcry from the British rum industry led to the Molasses Act of 1733, which levied a prohibitive tax on molasses imported into the Thirteen Colonies from foreign countries or colonies. Rum at this time accounted for approximately 80% of New England\\'s exports, and paying the duty would have put the distilleries out of business: as a result, both compliance with and enforcement of the act were minimal.  Strict enforcement of the Molasses Act\\'s successor, the Sugar Act , in 1764 may have helped cause the American Revolution .  In the slave trade, rum was also used as a medium of exchange . For example, the slave Venture Smith (whose history was later published) had been purchased in Africa, for four gallons of rum plus a piece of calico .\\n\nIn \"The Doctor\\'s Secret Journal\", an account of the happenings at Fort Michilimackinac in northern Michigan from 1769 to 1772 by Daniel Morison, a surgeon\\'s mate, noted that there was not much for the men to do and drinking rum was very popular.  In fact, Ensign Robert Johnstone, one of the officers, \"thought proper to turn trader by selling (the) common rum to the soldiers & all others by whom he might gain a penny in this clandestine Manner.\" To conceal this theft, \"he was observed to have filled up several Barrels of common rum with boiling water to make up the Leakage.\"  : 26 Ensign Johnstone had no trouble selling this diluted rum.  \\n\nThe popularity of rum continued after the American Revolution; George Washington insisting on a barrel of Barbados rum at his 1789 inauguration.  \\n\nRum started to play an important role in the political system; candidates attempted to influence the outcome of an election through their generosity with rum. The people would attend the hustings to see which candidate appeared more generous. The candidate was expected to drink with the people to show he was independent and truly a republican.   \\n\nEventually, the restrictions on sugar imports from the British West Indies , combined with the development of American whiskeys , led to a decline in the drink\\'s popularity in North America.\\n\nRum\\'s association with piracy began with English privateers \\' trading in the valuable commodity. Some of the privateers became pirates and buccaneers, with a continuing fondness for rum; the association between the two was only strengthened by literary works such as Robert Louis Stevenson \\'s Treasure Island .  \\n\nThe association of rum with the Royal Navy began in 1655 when a Royal Navy fleet captured the island of Jamaica . With the availability of domestically produced rum, the British changed the daily ration of liquor given to seamen from French brandy to rum.  \\n\nNavy rum was originally a blend mixed from rums produced in the West Indies . It was initially supplied at a strength of 100 degrees (UK) proof, 57% alcohol by volume (ABV), as that was the only strength that could be tested (by the gunpowder test ) before the invention of the hydrometer .  The term \"Navy strength\" is used in modern Britain to specify spirits bottled at 57% ABV.  In 1866 the Navy fixed the issued strength at 95.5 proof (defined as \"4.5 under-Proof\", equal to 54.6% ABV).  \\n\nWhile the ration was originally given neat or mixed with lime juice, the practice of watering down the rum began around 1740. To help minimize the effect of the alcohol on his sailors, Admiral Edward Vernon had the rum ration watered, producing a mixture that became known as grog . Many believe the term was coined in honour of the grogram cloak Admiral Vernon wore in rough weather.  The Royal Navy continued to give its sailors a daily rum ration, known as a \"tot\", until the practice was abolished on 31 July 1970.  \\n\nToday, a tot (totty) of rum is still issued on special occasions, using an order to \" splice the mainbrace \", which may only be given by a member of the royal family or, on certain occasions, the admiralty board in the UK, with similar restrictions in other Commonwealth navies.  Recently, such occasions have included royal marriages or birthdays, or special anniversaries. In the days of daily rum rations, the order to \"splice the mainbrace\" meant double rations would be issued.\\n\nA legend involving naval rum and Horatio Nelson says that following his victory and death at the Battle of Trafalgar , Nelson\\'s body was preserved in a cask of rum to allow transportation back to England. Upon arrival, however, the cask was opened and found to be empty of rum. The [pickled] body was removed and, upon inspection, it was discovered that the sailors had drilled a hole in the bottom of the cask and drunk all the rum, hence the term \"Nelson\\'s blood\" being used to describe rum. It also serves as the basis for the term tapping the admiral being used to describe surreptitiously sucking liquor from a cask through a straw. The details of the story are disputed, as many historians claim the cask contained French brandy , whilst others claim instead the term originated from a toast to Admiral Nelson.  Variations of the story, involving different notable corpses, have been in circulation for many years. The official record states merely that the body was placed in \"refined spirits\" and does not go into further detail.  \\n\nThe Royal New Zealand Navy was the last naval force to give sailors a free daily tot of rum. The Royal Canadian Navy still gives a rum ration on special occasions; the rum is usually provided out of the commanding officer\\'s fund and is 150 proof (75%). The order to \"splice the mainbrace\" (i.e. take rum) can be given by the King as commander-in-chief, as occurred on 29 June 2010, when previous monarch Queen Elizabeth II gave the order to the Royal Canadian Navy as part of the celebration of their 100th anniversary.\\n\nRum became an important trade good in the early period of the colony of New South Wales . The value of rum was based upon the lack of coinage among the population of the colony, and due to the drink\\'s ability to allow its consumer to temporarily forget about the lack of creature comforts available in the new colony. The value of rum was such that convict settlers could be induced to work the lands owned by officers of the New South Wales Corps. Due to rum\\'s popularity among the settlers, the colony gained a reputation for drunkenness, though their alcohol consumption was less than levels commonly consumed in England at the time.  \\n\nAustralia was so far away from Britain that the penal colony, established in 1788, faced severe food shortages, compounded by poor conditions for growing crops and the shortage of livestock. Eventually, it was realized that it might be cheaper for India , instead of Britain, to supply the settlement of Sydney . By 1817, two out of every three ships which left Sydney went to Java or India, and cargoes from Bengal fed and equipped the colony. Casks of Bengal Rum (which was reputed to be stronger than Jamaican Rum, and not so sweet) were brought back in the depths of nearly every ship from India. The cargoes were floated ashore clandestinely before the ships docked, by the Royal Marines regiment which controlled the sales. It was against the direct orders of the governors, who had ordered the searching of every docking ship. British merchants in India grew wealthy by sending ships to Sydney \"laden half with rice and half with bad spirits\".  \\n\nRum was intimately involved in the only military takeover of an Australian government, known as the Rum Rebellion . When William Bligh became governor of the colony, he attempted to remedy the perceived problem of drunkenness by outlawing the use of rum as a medium of exchange. In response to Bligh\\'s attempt to regulate the use of rum, in 1808, the New South Wales Corps marched with fixed bayonets to Government House and placed Bligh under arrest. The mutineers continued to control the colony until the arrival of Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810.  \\n\nIn India, rum was not traditionally produced as the production processes used to make jaggery from sugarcane do not produce molasses as a by-product. Rum was not produced in India commercially until the introduction of cane sugar production processes which did. The production of spirits along with the core commodity of sugar allowed for these plantations to have high economic returns. Production expanded rapidly to meet both domestic and export markets (however exports to Great Britain were restricted by protectionist policies). Rum production continued after the end of the colonial era. Today, most spirits produced in India labeled as whisky, vodka, and gin are made with a neutral rum derived base. Old Monk is the primary brand of dark rum consumed in contemporary India.  \\n\nCommercial rum production was introduced into Taiwan along with commercial sugar production during the Japanese colonial period . Rum production continued under the Republic of China, however, it was neglected by Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation which held the national liquor monopoly.  The industry diversified after privatization and the de-monopolization of the Taiwanese alcoholic beverage industry.  \\n\nCategorization\nDividing rum into meaningful groupings is complicated because no single standard exists for what constitutes rum. Instead, rum is defined by the varying rules and laws of the nations producing the spirit. The differences in definitions include issues such as spirit proof , minimum ageing, and even naming standards.\\n\nMexico requires rum be aged a minimum of eight months; the Dominican Republic, Panama and Venezuela require two years. Naming standards also vary. Argentina defines rums as white, gold, light, and extra light. Grenada and Barbados use the terms white, overproof, and matured, while the United States defines rum, rum liqueur, and flavored rum.  In Australia, rum is divided into dark or red rum (underproof known as UP, overproof known as OP, and triple distilled) and white rum.\\n\nDespite these differences in standards and nomenclature, the following divisions are provided to help show the wide variety of rums produced.\\n\nWithin the Caribbean, each island or production area has a unique style. For the most part, these styles can be grouped by the language traditionally spoken. Due to the overwhelming influence of Puerto Rican rum, most rum consumed in the United States is produced in the \"Spanish-speaking\" style.\\n\nCacha\\xc3\\xa7a is a spirit similar to rum that is produced in Brazil. Cachaca also comes from sugar cane. Some countries, including the United States, classify cacha\\xc3\\xa7a as a type of rum. Seco , from Panama, is also a spirit similar to rum, which is triple distilled, similar to some vodka .  \\n\nMexico produces a number of brands of light and dark rum, as well as other less-expensive flavored and unflavored sugarcane-based liquors, such as aguardiente de caña and charanda . Aguardiente is also the name for unaged distilled cane spirit in some, primarily Spanish-speaking countries since their definition of rum includes at least two years of ageing in wood.\\n\nA spirit known as aguardiente , distilled from molasses and often infused with anise , with additional sugarcane juice added after distillation, is produced in Central America and northern South America.  \\n\nIn West Africa, and particularly in Liberia, \\'cane juice\\' (also known as Liberian rum  or simply CJ within Liberia itself  ) is a cheap, strong spirit distilled from sugarcane, which can be as strong as 43% ABV (86 proof).  A refined cane spirit has also been produced in South Africa since the 1950s, simply known as cane or \"spook\".\\n\nWithin Europe, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a similar spirit made from sugar beet is known as Tuzemak .\\n\nIn Germany, a cheap substitute for genuine dark rum is called Rum-Verschnitt (literally: blended or \"cut\" rum). This drink is made of genuine dark rum (often high-ester rum from Jamaica), rectified spirit , and water. Very often, caramel coloring is used, too. The relative amount of genuine rum it contains can be quite low since the legal minimum is only 5%. In Austria , a similar rum called Inl\\xc3\\xa4nderrum or domestic rum is available. However, Austrian Inl\\xc3\\xa4nderrum is always a spiced rum, such as the brand Stroh ; German Rum-Verschnitt , in contrast, is never spiced or flavored.\\n\nThe grades and variations used to describe rum depend on the location where rum was produced. Despite these variations, the following terms are frequently used to describe various types of rum:\\n\nProduction method\nUnlike some other spirits, rum has no defined production methods. Instead, rum production is based on traditional styles that vary between locations and distillers.\\n\nSugarcane is traditionally collected by sugarcane machete  cutters who cut the cane near to the ground, where the largest concentration of sugars is found, before lopping off the green tips. A good cutter can cut three tons of cane per day on average, but this is a small fraction of what a machine can cut, therefore mechanised harvesting is now utilized.\\n\nSugarcane comprises around 63% to 73% water, 12% to 16% soluble sugar, 2% to 3% non-sugars, and 11% to 16% fiber.  To extract the water and sugar juice, the harvested cane is cleaned, sliced into small lengths, and milled (pressed).\\n\nMost rum is produced from molasses, which is made from sugarcane. A rum\\'s quality is dependent on the quality and variety of the sugar cane that was used to create it. The sugar cane\\'s quality depends on the soil type and climate that it was grown in. Within the Caribbean, much of this molasses is from Brazil.  \\nA notable exception is the French-speaking islands, where sugarcane juice is the preferred base ingredient.  In Brazil itself, the distilled alcoholic drink derived from cane juice is distinguished from rum and called cacha\\xc3\\xa7a .  \\n\nYeast and water are added to the base ingredient to start the fermentation process.  \\nWhile some rum producers allow wild yeasts to perform the fermentation, most use specific strains of yeast to help provide a consistent taste and predictable fermentation time.  Dunder , the yeast-rich foam from previous fermentations, is the traditional yeast source in Jamaica .  \\n\"The yeast employed will determine the final taste and aroma profile,\"\\nsays Jamaican master blender Joy Spence .  \\nDistillers that make lighter rums, such as Bacardi , prefer to use faster-working yeasts.  \\nThe use of slower-working yeasts causes more esters to accumulate during fermentation, allowing for a fuller-tasting rum.  \\n\nFermentation products like 2-ethyl-3-methyl butyric acid and esters like ethyl butyrate and ethyl hexanoate give rise to the sweetness and fruitiness of rum.  \\n\nThe fermented product is then distilled. As with all other aspects of rum production, no standard method is used for distillation.\\nWhile some producers work in batches using pot stills , most rum production is done using column still distillation.  \\nPot still output contains more congeners than the output from column stills, so produces fuller-tasting rums.  \\n\nMany countries require rum to be aged for at least one year.  This ageing is commonly performed in used bourbon casks,  but may also be performed in other types of wooden casks or stainless-steel tanks. The ageing process determines the colour of the rum. When aged in oak casks, it becomes dark, whereas rum aged in stainless steel tanks remains virtually colourless.\\n\nDue to the tropical climate common to most rum-producing areas, rum matures at a much faster rate than is typical for whisky or brandy (i.e. achieving a similar level of maturity takes considerably less time). An indication of this higher rate is the angels\\' share , or the amount of product lost to evaporation . While products aged in France or Scotland see about a 2% loss each year, tropical rum producers may see as much as 10%.  \\n\nAfter ageing, rum is normally blended to ensure a consistent flavour, the final step in the rum-making process.  During blending, light rums may be filtered to remove any colour gained during ageing. For dark rums, caramel may be added for colour.\\n\nThere have been attempts to match the molecular composition of aged rum in significantly shorter time spans with artificial ageing using heat and light.  \\n\nIn cuisine\nBesides rum punches , cocktails such as the Cuba libre and daiquiri have stories of their invention in the Caribbean. Tiki bars in the U.S. helped expand rum\\'s horizons with inventions such as the mai tai and zombie . Other cocktails containing rum include the piña colada , a drink made popular in America by Rupert Holmes \\' song \" Escape \",  and the mojito . Cold-weather drinks made with rum include the rum toddy and hot buttered rum .  \\n\nA number of local specialties also use rum, including Bermuda \\'s Dark \\'n\\' Stormy (Gosling\\'s Black Seal rum with ginger beer ), the Painkiller from the British Virgin Islands , and a New Orleans cocktail known as the Hurricane . Jagertee is a mixture of rum and black tea popular in colder parts of Central Europe and served on special occasions in the British Army , where it is called Gunfire . Ti\\' Punch , French Creole for \"petit punch\", is a traditional drink in parts of the French West Indies .\\n\nRum may also be used as a base in the manufacture of liqueurs and syrups , such as falernum and most notably, Mamajuana .\\n\nRum is used in a number of cooked dishes as a flavoring agent in items such as rum balls or rum cakes . It is commonly used to macerate fruit used in fruitcakes and is also used in marinades for some Caribbean dishes. Rum is also used in the preparation of rumtopf , bananas Foster , and some hard sauces . Rum is sometimes mixed into ice cream , often with raisins (creating a flavor called rum raisin ), and in baking, it is occasionally used in Joe Froggers , a type of cookie from New England.\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links",
