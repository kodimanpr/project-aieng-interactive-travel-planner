The festival has been celebrated for almost fifty years, and the first edition was celebrated in 1969.  Its original purpose was and still is to showcase Puerto Rico\\'s flora and island\\'s floral industry. The festival was officially established for its second edition when the \" Festival de las Flores de Aibonito, Inc \" (\"Aibonito Festival of Flowers, Inc.\") was incorporated with the objective of promoting and celebrating the town\\'s floriculture and agriculture. In 2017 Hurricane Mar√≠a brought significant amount of rain, wind and destruction which decimated the flower industry of Aibonito.  In 2020 and 2021  the festival was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico .\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links",
