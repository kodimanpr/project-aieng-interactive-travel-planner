In 1958, Bacardí purchased 138 acres of land in Cataño (a suburb of San Juan ) and then governor Luis Muñoz Marín called it the \"Cathedral of Rum\".  \\n\nThe Bacardi Corporation in Cataño supplies the largest quantity of rum consumed in the world  and is the private company that most contributes to the public treasury of Puerto Rico . \\n\nThe Bacardi Distillery was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 6, 2010, based on two criteria: (criteria A) the distillery\\'s enormous contribution to the economic development of Puerto Rico since its establishment and (criteria C) its designers included W. Donald Christie, Henry Klumb , Héctor Varela, and Enrique Gutiérrez. The builders included José Benítez Gutiérrez, Ramón M. Benítez, Ignacio Martín, and SAG MAC.  \\n\nThere is a family museum at the complex and in 2012, the Bacardi family celebrated 150 years in business and gathered at the complex in Cataño.

At the complex, tourists can go on a historical tour, a rum tasting tour and learn how to mix Bacardi rum drinks.  \\n\nAfter Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, the distillery was soon able to provide clean drinking water to residents.  \\n\nBuildings\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links",
