Gonz√°lez, the president of the church\\'s Caribbean Area , presiding.  At the groundbreaking, church leaders noted that construction of the temple was anticipated to take about two years.  \\n\nThe temple was originally planned to be completed in 2021,  but construction was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
