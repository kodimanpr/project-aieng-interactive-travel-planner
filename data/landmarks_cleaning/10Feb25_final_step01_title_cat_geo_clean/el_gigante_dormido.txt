Its highest peak, Cerro El Gigante , rises to 3,175 feet (968 m) in elevation above sea level.  \\n\nThe mountain is famous for its distinctive shape that resembles the silhouette of a reclining man\\'s head.

Due to its location south of the downtown district of Adjuntas Pueblo , the mountain can easily be seen from many parts of town.
