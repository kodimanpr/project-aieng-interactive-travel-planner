Dating back to defense expansions following attacks by the English in 1598 and the Dutch in 1625 , it was first built in 1634 as the Garita del Diablo (\"devil's sentry box \") and an artillery platform .  Over the next 150 years, especially in the reign of King Charles III of Spain , it continued to be developed into a bastion fort to reach its largest size in 1790.  Rising 150 ft from the Atlantic shoreline, the three-level edifice stands on a hill at the northern coastline of San Juan Islet , guarding the land entry to Old San Juan .  San Cristóbal , alongside El Morro , La Fortaleza , and other forts part of the Walls of Old San Juan , protected strategically and militarily important Puerto Rico , or La Llave de las Indias (The Key to the Indies ) ,  from invasion by competing world powers during the Age of Sail . It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983.  \\n\nHistory\nCastillo San Cristóbal was built on a hill originally known as the Cerro de la Horca (\"gallows Hill\") or the Cerro del Quemadero (\"burner's hill\"), changed to Cerro de San Cristóbal in honor of Saint Christopher , the patron of travelers. The fortress is considered the largest fortification built by Spain in the New World . When it was completed in 1783, it covered about 27 acres. The entrances to it were protected by two gates and drawbridges in what was called the Revellín de Santiago (Saint James Ravelin ) and the Bastión de Santiago (Saint James Bastion ). After close to a hundred years of relative peace in the area, this section of the fortification (about a third) was demolished in 1897 to help ease the flow of traffic in and out of the walled city .\\n\nIn 1634, the first defensive structure had been built in the area, the Fortín del Espigón (\"breakwater fort\")or the Garita del Diablo ( \"devil's sentry box\" ) . In 1765, San Cristóbal was conformed by a hornwork surrounded by a dry moat, which gave continuity to the walls of the city, and at the highest point of it, there was a artillery platform, or Caballero de San Miguel (Knight of Saint Michael) , for the emplacement of cannons. San Cristóbal derives its name from the hill on which the main defenses were built against the invasion of the city by land, although it also defended the north coast. By the time the work was completed, it became, the most extensive Spanish fortification in all of the Americas .\\n\nCharles III of Spain came to the Spanish throne in 1759, and in 1764 ordered Field Marshal Alexander O\\'Reilly and the engineers, Colonel Tomás O\\'Daly and Juan Francisco Mestre, to make the island a stronghold, a defense of the first order. The plans constituted the preparation for a war with England , which seemed inevitable. The order coincided with the Siege of Havana temporarily by the English . As a result of O\\'Reily\\'s reforms, the Revellín de San Carlos (Saint Charles Ravelin ) and the counterguard of La Trinidad (The Trinity) were built. Further east, a fort called El Abanico (The Fan) and a battery overlooking the sea, La Princesa (The Princess), were built. By 1788, the year of the king\\'s death, the reforms were complete. The defenses proved their effectiveness since in 1797 they helped to repel the invasion of seven thousand English soldiers commanded by the British general Ralph Abercromby .\\n\nCastillo San Cristóbal also contains five cisterns that were used for the storage of water during the ages of the Spanish Colony. They are extremely large (24 ft tall, 17 ft wide, and 57 ft long) and were used as bomb shelters during World War II .\\n\nHistorical gallery\nHistorical timeline\n1521 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 San Juan founded by Spanish settlers from Caparra .\\n\n1539 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Construction of the first fortified defenses at Castillo San Felipe del Morro and La Fortaleza , with batteries aimed at the harbor entrance.\\n\n1595 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The English attack San Juan, led by Sir Francis Drake, 25 ships penetrated the line of fire from El Morro .

One of the guerites at San Cristóbal is called Garita del Diablo (\"devil\\'s sentry box\").  It offers a vantage point to watchmen guarding the seashore while protecting them. This particular sentry box is one of the oldest parts of the fort, being built in 1634.  \\n\nThere are several legends surrounding the sentry box about soldiers disappearing from inside. However, it is mostly believed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and told so in various local stories \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that the only soldier that apparently disappeared was a soldier called Sánchez, who fled his post to escape with his girlfriend, called Dina.     \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links",
