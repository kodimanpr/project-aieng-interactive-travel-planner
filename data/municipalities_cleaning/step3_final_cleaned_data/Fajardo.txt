It is also home to the largest marina in the Caribbean, called Puerto del Rey . The town contains various hotels and inns.\\n\nOffshore, near Fajardo, a few islets can be found. These are Icacos , Isla Palomino , Palominito, and Diablo, among other uninhabited coral islands and barrier reefs.\\n\nHistory\nFajardo was founded in 1760, 1773 or 1774 (depending on the authority) as Santiago de Fajardo . It was one of the locations used by the American troops to invade Puerto Rico . On August 1, 1898 the USS Puritan under the command of Captain Frederic W. Rodgers , sailed the coastline near the city of Fajardo when he spotted the Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan (Cape San Juan lighthouse), which was supposed to be the landing site for the US Army in Puerto Rico. Rodgers ordered some of his men ashore, including Puerto Rican volunteers, with the mission to post the American flag atop the lighthouse.\\n\nOn November 14, 1824, in what was dubbed the \"Foxhardo\" Affair , US Naval Officer David Porter landed at Fajardo with 200 seamen and marines, threatening to destroy Fajardo because one of his men had been arrested in Puerto Rico. For taking this action without US approval, Porter was later court-martialed.  \\n\nAfter the Spanish-American War , Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico and determined that the population of Fajardo was 16,782.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Fajardo, the hurricane triggered numerous landslides with its strong winds and significant amount of rainfall.    \\n\nGeography\nFajardo is a coastal municipality with a number of islets .  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Fajardo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,    are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion .
