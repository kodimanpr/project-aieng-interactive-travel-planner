Guaynabo is spread over 9 barrios and Guaynabo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the suburb). Guaynabo is considered, along with its neighbors - San Juan and the municipalities of Bayamón , Carolina , Cataño , Trujillo Alto , and Toa Baja - to be part of the San Juan metropolitan area . It is also part of the larger San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area , (the largest MSA in Puerto Rico).\\n\nThe municipality has a land area of 27.13 square miles (70.3 km 2 ) and a population of 89,780 as of the 2020 census . The municipality is known for being an affluent suburb of San Juan and for its former Irish heritage. The studios of WAPA-TV is located in Guaynabo.\\n\nHistory\nThe first European settlement in Puerto Rico, Caparra , was founded in 1508 by Juan Ponce de León in land that is today part of Guaynabo. Ponce de León resided there as first Spanish governor of Puerto Rico. This settlement was abandoned in 1521 in favor of San Juan . The ruins of Caparra remain and are a U.S. National Historic Landmark . The Museum of the Conquest and Colonization of Puerto Rico, which features artifacts from the site and others in Puerto Rico, is located on the grounds.\\n\nThe municipality of Guaynabo was founded in 1769 by Pedro R. Davila (P.R.), after a struggle for division from the municipality of Bayamón . Previously, the municipality was known as Buinabo , a name that it is popularly said to mean in Taíno \" Here is another place of fresh water. \" Irish officer Thomas O\\'Daly and fellow Irishman Miguel Kirwan settled the area in the late 18th century and developed a farm and sugarcane plantation he named Hacienda San Patricio . The plantation no longer exists but the land on which it was located is now the central business district of Guaynabo and the San Patricio Plaza shopping mall.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In Guaynabo, where 26.9% of the population live below the poverty level, 2800 homes were destroyed.  The hurricane triggered numerous landslides in Guaynabo.   Then president Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump visited Guaynabo.  Due to the municipality\\'s fiscal difficulties, it was not until April 2, 2019, over a year and half later, that the overtime pay owed to municipal workers was paid.  \\n\nAfter 24 years as mayor, Héctor O\\'Neill García resigned in 2017 when allegations surfaced of sexual harassment toward a female municipal employee.  He was replaced in a run-off election by Angel Pérez Otero , who in turn was forced out due to his arrest for Federal corruption allegations in 2021.
