Santa Isabel is spread over 7 barrios and Santa Isabel Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center). It is the principal city of the Santa Isabel Micropolitan Statistical Area and is part of the Ponce-Yauco-Coamo Combined Statistical Area .\\n\nSanta Isabel is known as The Capital of Agriculture ,  La Ciudad de los Potros (\"City of Colts \") due to the number of potreros (or racehorse stud farms ) in the area.\\n\nHistory\nBefore being founded, the area where Santa Isabel is located today was part of the boundary between the cacicazgos (or Taíno regions) of Guaynia and Guayama . During the Spanish conquest and settlement of Borinquen , the area became key to the settlement and agriculture of Coamo which at the time was the second town to be founded in the southern part of the island.  Numerous estancias were established in the region during the time to cultivate \" frutos menores \" or small crops for local use such as rice, corn, beans and root vegetables . The area where Central Cortada is located was originally called Estancia Descalabrado , and was owned by Catalan settler Juan de Quintana from 1737.  \\n\nThe municipality of Santa Isabel was officially founded on October 5, 1842, by Antonio Vélez. Vélez led a group of residents to obtain independence from the municipality of Coamo, which Santa Isabel was originally a part of.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Santa Isabel was 4,858.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Santa Isabel, close to 500 people had to be rescued, the agriculture was leveled. The strong winds, 15 inches of rain, and rivers that crested, caused an estimated 12,000 homes to be completely or partially destroyed.  \\n\nGeography\nSanta Isabel is on the southern coast.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Santa Isabel is subdivided into barrios .
