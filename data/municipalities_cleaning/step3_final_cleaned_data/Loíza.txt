Loíza is spread over five barrios and Loíza Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . It is renowned for its rich Afro-Puerto Rican culture and heritage.\\n\nHistory\nSome say its name comes from a female cacique , named Loaíza or Yuíza, who governed the region formerly called Haimanio, on the shores of the Río Grande de Loíza . It is said that this cacique might have married a mulatto conquistador called Pedro Mejías, but there is no evidence of this.  Other sources point to a Spanish landlord named Iñigo López de Cervantes y Loayza, who owned a lot of the territory, and was renowned among governors and colonists of the time.  \\n\nIn 1692, Loíza was officially declared an urban area due to its population (100 houses and 1,146 residents), but it was in 1719 that the Spanish government declared it as an official town. It was founded by Gaspar de Arredondo.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Loíza was 12,522.  \\n\nIn the 1970s, an Aero Virgin Islands DC-3 plane crashed in a Loíza beach, with no fatalities.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.
