    "main_content": "Contents\nAibonito, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nAibonito  is a small mountain town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the Sierra de Cayey mountain range, north of Salinas ; south of Barranquitas and Comerío ; east of Coamo ; and west of Cidra , and Cayey . Aibonito is spread over 8 barrios and Aibonito Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nAibonito is located at a relatively high elevation (its main square is the highest in the island at 732 metres (2,401 ft) above sea level), which makes its climate cooler than most of Puerto Rico \\'s towns.\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Aibonito is possibly a combination of Spanish and Taíno from Hatibon or Jatibon , which the native name of the Aibonito River . Jatibon most likely translates to \"black river\" or \"night river\", the indigenous name of the river which was later turned into a diminutive in Spanish ( Jatibon-ito ). It is common to have native place names in Puerto Rico be historically adopted and modified into the Spanish language such as Mucarabones for example, which is a plural of Mucarabon , meaning \" owl river\" in Taíno.\\n\nThere\\'s also a legend that tells of a Spanish soldier called Diego Alvarez who on May 17, 1615, reached one of the highest peaks in the area and upon watching the view, exclaimed \"\\xc2 1Ay, qué bonito!\" (\" Oh, how pretty! \") which eventually was turned into the name of the region. If this is the case, it would be considered folk etymology .  \\n\nSome of the municipality\\'s nicknames include Ciudad de las Flores (\"City of Flowers\") and Jardín de Puerto Rico (\"Puerto Rico\\'s Garden\") after the region\\'s floral industry and annual festival , and Ciudad Fría (\"Cold City\") and Nevera de Puerto Rico (\"Puerto Rico\\'s refrigerator \") after the fact that the municipality has recorded some of the island\\'s lowest temperatures.  \\n\nHistory\nBefore the Spanish colonization of the Americas , it is believed that there were Taíno settlements in the region that belonged to Cacique Orocobix domain.\\n\nAfter the Spanish arrived, it is believed that a ranch was established in the region by Pedro Zorascoechea in 1630, which led the development of a hamlet . However, it wasn\\'t until 1822 when Don Manuel Veléz presented himself before the government, representing the inhabitants of the area, to ask for Aibonito to be officially declared a town. This was authorized on March 13, 1824, by Governor Don Miguel de la Torre . The first Catholic church in Aibonito was built in 1825. The building was replaced by the current church, which was started in 1887 and completed in 1897. After the town was officially constituted, barrios started developing in the area.\\n\nOn the Spanish-American War of 1898, around 800 Spanish and Puerto Rican soldiers were able to defeat the invading American troops due to their strategic placement in Asomante Mountain . This scrimmage came to an end when the Spanish government surrendered on August 12, 1898. The Spanish and Puerto Rican forces at Asomante never surrendered and would have held their position indefinitely if not for the buckling of the Spanish government in Madrid .\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Aibonito was 8,596.\\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Aibonito with the significant amount of rainfall.    Around 1,500 homes were completely or partially destroyed. The hurricane destroyed the poultry industry of Aibonito with nearly 1.8 million chickens killed. Known as \"The Garden of Puerto Rico\" Aibonito has celebrated a flower festival since 1969. Aibonito\\'s floriculture industry was completely decimated by Hurricane María.  \\n\nGeography\nAibonito is located in the Sierra de Cayey , part of the Cordillera Central in Puerto Rico .  Aibonito is the town with the highest elevation in Puerto Rico , located at 2,401 feet above sea level. Some of its mountains are La Sierra (2,394 ft), Asomante (2,042 ft) and Buena Vista (2,042 ft).  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Aibonito is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Aibonito: the Municipal neighborhood, Algarrobo barrio, Amoldadero and Los Muros in La Plata barrio, El Campito, El Coquí, El Fresal, La Españolita, La Represa, Las Bambúas, Los Cuadritos, Parcelas Nuevas in Pasto barrio, Parcelas Rabanal, Parcelas Viejas in Pasto, San Luis, Sector El Nueve, and Sector Gallera.  \\n\nSome of the rivers that flow through Aibonito are the Río de Aibonito , Río Cuyón , Río de la Plata and Río Usabón . Rio Manu\\n\nAibonito features a rather mild tropical rainforest climate , owing to its elevation and location, close but still slightly removed from the equator, as well as being directly exposed to the wind and moisture of the Trade Winds . It borders on a subtropical highland climate , and also a humid subtropical climate , though like the former, summers are not much hotter than the warm to cool winters, as it is typical of higher elevations near the equator. As the trade winds coming from the northeast go through orographic lift , rainfall is both greater and more consistent throughout the year than in coastal areas (particularly the south coast only minutes away), with fog being a common occurrence. Aibonito holds the record for the lowest temperature in Puerto Rico. That is 40 °F (4 °C) on March 9, 1911.  The highest temperature record is 98 °F (37 °C) recorded on September 29, 1920.  Aibonito is among Puerto Rico\\'s coolest towns.\\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nTwo of the older landmarks of Aibonito are the Old Encanto Theater , and Moscoso Pharmacy .
