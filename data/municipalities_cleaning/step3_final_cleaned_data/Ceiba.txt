Ceiba is located in the north-east coast of the island, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, south of Fajardo , north of Naguabo and southeast of Río Grande . Located about one hour\\'s driving distance from San Juan , Ceiba is spread over 7 barrios and Ceiba Pueblo (the downtown area and administrative center). It is part of the Fajardo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nCeiba was founded on April 7, 1838 by Luis de la Cruz. Ceiba derives its name from an Indian word Seyba, which is the name for a famous tree that grows in the island, Ceiba pentandra , the kapok tree.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico and the population numbers of Ceiba were consolidated with the population numbers of Fajardo.  \\n\nCeiba, situated near Fajardo, used to be home of an American military Naval base, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station . Most of the units were relocated and the base was closed in 2004. Ex-governor Sila María Calderón suggested turning the property into a major international airport, to serve as a relief to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan , and to increase the number of international airlines that operate into Puerto Rico. She was met with skepticism about these plans from such groups as environmentalists, economists and others, but in 2008, José Aponte de la Torre Airport was inaugurated at the base\\'s former site.\\n\nLocals are commonly known as \" Los Come Sopa \" ( Spanish for \\'the soup-eaters\\'). Even though there is no official reason as to why they are called this, a few stories have been suggested. Among the tales is the belief that since the town did not have a local meat market people had to travel long distances in order to buy some meat and therefore mostly ate soup. [ citation needed ] \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Ceiba.   Forty-nine structures in Punta Figuera were destroyed completely.  In July 2018, some residents received monies via FEMA to rebuild their homes.  \\n\nGeography\nThe Reserva Natural Medio Mundo y Daguao (Nature Reserve Medio Mundo and Daguao) extends along the coastline between Ceiba and Fajardo .  95% of the forest is classified as mangrove . Various species of birds can be seen as well as turtles and manatees . Its rivers includes; Río Daguao , Río Demajagua and Río Fajardo .  \\n\nThe municipality extends northwest into the seas between Fajardo and Culebra and thereby includes the reefs and islets named Arrecifes Hermanos and Arrecifes Barriles .  The reef are closest to the coastal barrio of Machos, but barrio boundaries are not defined in that area.  \\n\nThe highest point in the municipality is Pico del Oeste in the Sierra de Luquillo at 3,346 feet (1,020 m) of elevation.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Ceiba is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Ceiba: Saco, Las Calderonas, Parcelas Aguas Claras, Parcelas Nuevas, Prado Hermoso, and Quebrada Seca.   \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Ceiba page lists Charco Frío y Las Tinajas , Playa Los Machos , the mangroves at Medio Mundo y Daguao , as places of interest.  \\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , there are 60 beaches in Ceiba, including Los Machos Beach.  \\nOther places of interest include:\\n\nCulture\nCeiba celebrates its patron saint festival in June.

Rodríguez and Luis Daniel Rivera were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nCeiba\\'s flag derives its design and colors from the municipal coat of arms. This maintains the same symbolism given to the coat of arms. It is made of two vertical lines of the same width, red in the left side and green on the right. The red side depicts a yellow cross.  \\n\nThe Ceiba coat of arms depicts a shield with a Ceiba tree. In the upper part of the shield is a red horizontal space with a golden cross in the middle and a golden fleur-de-lis on either side.

Above the shield there is a golden Spanish fort.  \\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links",
