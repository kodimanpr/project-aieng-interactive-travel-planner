It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area . Aguada\\'s population is spread over 17 barrios and Aguada Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city).\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe name Aguada is a shortening of the town\\'s original name San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada. The word aguada literally translates to \"watery\" or \"watered down\" from Spanish, possibly a reference to the town\\'s strategic importance as a port in the Mona Passage and the Atlantic Ocean.\\n\nThe municipality has many nicknames: La Villa de Sotomayor (\"Sotomayor\\'s Villa\") is a reference to one of the town\\'s Spanish founders, Cristóbal de Sotomayor; La Ciudad del Descubrimiento (\"City of the Discovery\") is a reference to the possibility that Christopher Columbus first landed in Puerto Rico at what is today the municipality\\'s territory; El Pueblo Playero translates to \"the beach town\" and La Ciudad del Vaticano (\"the Vatican \\'s City\") which references the town\\'s early importance for Catholicism in the island.  \\n\nHistory\nA Taíno settlement called Aymamón was located close to the Culebrinas River .   \\n\nBahía de Aguada (Aguada Bay) in Aguada has historically been recognized as the location where Christopher Columbus first landed in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on 19 November 1493. However, it is believed by most historians that Bahía de Añasco (Añasco Bay) in the neighboring town of Añasco was the place of Columbus' first landing and stay of two days in Puerto Rico before continuing to La Navidad , first European settlement in the Americas , in Haiti in Hispaniola .    \\n\nIn July 1510, Cristóbal de Sotomayor received control of the area from Juan Ponce de León and renamed the town Villa de Sotomayor (Sotomayor Village) .  However, in 1511 the settlement was attacked and burned by the local Taínos . That same year, the Spanish crown ordered a monastery be established in Puerto Rico, and the Ermita de Espinar was founded. The name of the area was then changed to San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada , since the friars were Franciscan . The monastery was finished in 1516. \\n\nIn 1526, King Charles I of Spain officially founded the Aguada settlement. However, in 1529, Taínos attacked the monastery killing the friars and burning the settlement.  The Taínos , indigenous people of Puerto Rico, were believed to have practiced polytheism . As the Spanish began to colonize the Caribbean area, they wanted to convert the natives to Catholicism .  The Caribs destroyed a church of Franciscans in Aguada and killed five of its members in 1579.  \\n\nStill, Aguada resurfaced and became a stopover point for ships on their way to Spain from South America.  On September 17, 1692, King Charles II of Spain emitted a Royal Decree declaring Aguada a \"village\" and assigning Captain Juan López de Segura as War Lieutenant and Ordinary Mayor of the Villa de San Francisco de Asís de la Aguada.  \\n\nIn 1737, Philip V , King of Spain , declared that all mail en route to Venezuela and other South American countries from Puerto Rico should exit from Aguada\\'s ports, leading to the area\\'s economic growth. Also, an increase in population has been attributed to possible desertions from foreign merchant ships.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Aguada was 10,581.\\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, two disasters affected the town of Aguada. First, a huge fire in 1912 destroyed most of the town buildings, including the old city hall , which contained all the city archives. On October 11, 1918, at 10:14:42 local time an earthquake known as the San Fermín earthquake destroyed the church and other structures.  At Rio Culebrinas , 1000 kg blocks of limestone from the wrecked Columbus monument were carried inland to distances of 46-76 meters (151-249 feet) by waves 4.0 m (13.1 ft) high.  \\n\nHurricane María on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Aguada, with its strong winds and heavy rain.   Infrastructure and an estimated 8,000 homes in Aguada were damaged or destroyed. Two police officers died when they were caught in the flooded Culebrinas River .  \\n\nOn July 16, 2023 a tornado touched down in Aguada, producing EF1 damage which included tearing a roof from a house and damage to power lines.  The city is notorious for stormy weather. \\n\nEl Matador de Tiburones (The Aguada Shark Killer) is folklore that comes out of Aguada and was written around 1640. It tells of a young man who was accustomed to fighting sharks but was without his religious charm . When asked to demonstrate his shark-fighting capabilities to visiting Spanish dignitaries, he hesitated. All day and night he pondered whether he could fight a shark without his religious charm. Even though the Spaniards had increased their offer to 3 bars of gold the matador was hesitant. In the morning, as the shark came into the bay, the spectators who were gathered on the beach yelled in anticipation, and El Matador de Tiburones , as the young man was called, was unable to stop himself. He jumped into the open sea pursuing the shark and fought it with his bare hands. He was nearly killed and after receiving his prize of gold, vowed to never again fight a shark.  \\n\nGeography\nAguada is located in the west coast of the island of Puerto Rico . It borders the Atlantic Ocean and Aguadilla on the north, Moca on the east, Añasco on the south, and Rincón on the west.

It features three main colors: white, red, and yellow. White represents purity and the waters of Culebrinas River . Over the white field, a blue triangle with a white dove is featured. The dove is the symbol of peace that unites the towns. Red symbolizes the martyrdom of Franciscan friars from Espinal. Over the red field, there\\'s a black cross which represents the birth of Christianity in Puerto Rico. The name of \"Aguada\" is also above the cross. The yellow field represents happiness and hospitality of the residents. Over the yellow field, there\\'s a white star which symbolizes the hope of the town for more development and progress.   \\n\nThe coat of arms is divided into two main fields. The upper field features a cross, with the interlaced arms of Christ and Father Saint Francis. It is taken from the badge of the Order of Friars Minor . It represents the motto \"Pax et Bonum\", which means \"peace and good will between man and the Redeemer\". The sun below the cross symbolizes the light that brightens the world. The lower part of the shield consists of five ships that symbolize the second voyage of Christopher Columbus , who allegedly arrived at the western \"Guaniquilla\" coast on November 19, 1493, to gather water. Although the precise location is disputed, the Aguada wells ( Puerto de los pozos de la Aguada de Colón ) is a plausible site for the actual event.   \\n\nThe mural crown in the upper part of the shield signifies the title of village, that was given to this town by King Charles III in 1778. The official colors of the shield are red, which stands for the fraternal love in Aguada; gold, for the Spanish royalty in Puerto Rico; green, for the island\\'s hope and fertility; black, for the wooden beam of the cross; blue, for the sky and the kingship of God; and white, for Christ\\'s purity and the purity of the people of the town toward the cultural patrimony.   \\n\nAguada has various nicknames, most of them pertaining to its origins.

Other nicknames are \"El Pueblo Playero\" (\"The Beach Town\") for its many beaches, and \"La Ciudad del Vaticano\" (\"The Vatican City\") for being considered the \"capital of Catholicism \" in the island.   \\n\nAguada\\'s anthem was written by Rolando Acevedo Lorenzo.  \\n\nSaint Francis of Assisi is Aguada\\'s patron saint.\\n\nNotable \"Aguadeños\"\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links",
