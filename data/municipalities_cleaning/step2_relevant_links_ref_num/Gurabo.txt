It is located in the central eastern region, north of San Lorenzo ; south of Trujillo Alto ; east of Caguas ; and west of Carolina and Juncos . Gurabo is spread over 9 barrios and Gurabo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nGurabo\\'s history dates as far back as the 17th century, when it was actually part of Caguas . Then, the area was known as Burabo . By 1700, transportation, medical and economic troubles were crippling the population of the Burabo area; traveling to Caguas\\' center for business and medical help was not easy and took hours. This led many of Burabo\\' s citizens to seek autonomy for the area.\\n\nIt would be long, however, before Gurabo was separated from Caguas. The separation movement was brought forward by an 1812 meeting of all 168 family leaders in Gurabo, who decided to have Luis del Carmen Echevarría lead them in their quest for independence, based on the large number of residents in Burabo .\\n\nIn 1815, Gurabo became a municipality. In 1822, the first Catholic church in town was erected. In 1903, the first Baptist church opened its doors in Gurabo town.\\n\nGurabo is also known as \" La Ciudad de las Escaleras \", or the \"City of Stairs\". Located in the town center district of El Cerro , the stairs ( step streets ) are about twenty-two floors high, and they are painted in bright colors.  \\n\nGurabo\\'s mayor is Rosachely Rivera Santana .  \\n\nThe significant amount of rainfall from Hurricane Maria triggered numerous landslides in Gurabo on September 20, 2017.   Many people had to be rescued from floods and 489 homes were destroyed.  \\n\nGeography\nGurabo is located on the east side of Puerto Rico in the Caguas Valley .  \\n\nLocated in Gurabo are a number of rivers, streams, and unnamed creeks.  \\nThe main river to cross the municipality is the Gurabo and a portion of the Loíza River runs through Gurabo.   \\nIn 2018, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced work would be done on Gurabo River.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Gurabo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , located near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Gurabo: El Cerro, Estancias de Hato Nuevo, and Villa Alegre.  \\n\nEconomy\nManufacturing (metal, paper, plastics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, and electrical machinery).\\n\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website.
