Luquillo is spread over 5 barrios and Luquillo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It lends its name to the Sierra de Luquillo , where El Yunque National Forest is located. It is part of the Fajardo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nThe city of Luquillo is 26 square miles and it sits on 12 miles of Atlantic coastline. It is nestled between the blue waters of the Atlantic and the El Yunque National Forest , a rainforest , giving it a diverse and unique ecology. Luquillo marks the beginning of the Northeast Ecological Corridor Nature Reserve which runs down the coast from downtown Luquillo all the way down to the Seven Seas Beach in Fajardo . During certain times of the year, it is not unusual to encounter rare or endangered species of fauna (like the leatherback turtle ) while visiting in Luquillo.  \\n\nHistory\nLuquillo was founded in 1797 and is known as \" La Capital del Sol \" (Capital of the Sun), \" La Riviera de Puerto Rico \" (the Puerto Rican Riviera), and \" Los Come Cocos \" (the coconut eaters). Legend says that the town was named after the Indian cacique Loquillo , who died a few years after the last Indian rebellion in 1513. However, the word Luquillo most likely originates from Yukiyu , the Taino name for El Yunque , most likely meaning \"white mountain\" (i.e. foggy mountain).In 1989, Hurricane Hugo damaged the town.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico.  In Luquillo, rivers were breached, there were landslides, the electrical power collapsed, and 1100 homes were destroyed or damaged. Incidents of looting and assaults were reported in the aftermath of the storm.    \\n\nGeography\nLuquillo is located on the northeast coast.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Luquillo is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Luquillo: Barrio Pitahaya, Sector Santo Domingo, Mata de Plátano, Río Chiquito, and Sector Fortuna Playa.   \\n\nTourism\nThere are 14 beaches in Luquillo including La Pared .  La Pared , which translates to \"The Wall\", is considered a dangerous beach.  If you stay on the coastal highway going east from San Juan , you\\'ll soon reach Luquillo Beach , officially known as La Monserrate Beach ( Balneario de la Monserrate ). This huge plantation of majestic coconut palms shades more than a mile of fine and shimmering sand. It is one of the most popular and nicest public beaches in the San Juan metropolitan area . It offers cafeterias, public bathrooms with showers, access for disabled people, and an ample parking lot. La Monserrate Beach is one of the public beaches most frequented by the locals. La Selva, is a small cove on the east coast. It is arguably one of the best surf spots on the east coast. The only way to get to it is about a 2-mile walk through a cow farm, but it\\'s worth the trip if you can talk someone into telling you how to get there.\\n\nEconomy\nCulture\nLuquillo celebrates its patron saint festival in March.
