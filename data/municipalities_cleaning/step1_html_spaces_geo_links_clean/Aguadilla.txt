Aguadilla is spread over 15 barrios and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city and core of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nAguadilla is a shortening of the town\\'s original name San Carlos de La Aguadilla . The name Aguadilla is a diminutive of Aguada , which is the name of the town and municipality located to the south. Some of the municipality\\'s nicknames are: Jardín del Atlántico (\"Garden of the Atlantic \"), Pueblo de los Tiburones (\" Shark Town\") and La Villa del Ojo de Agua (\"Villa of the Water Spring \") after the natural water spring that was used by early settlers and Spanish soldiers as a water source which is now located in El Parterre Square in Aguadilla Pueblo .  \\n\nHistory\nAccording to sources, a Taíno settlement called Aymamón was located close to the Culebrinas River .  \\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of Aguada . In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de Córdova was approved.  But it was not until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Higüey barrios.  This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, Fray \\xc3\\x8dñigo Abbad y Lasierra in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos de La Aguadilla .\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. Agustín Stahl in his Foundation of Aguadilla , it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in 1775.  \\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when Santo Domingo became independent for the first time, the loyalists of Spanish descent emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don Pedro Tomás de Córdova, the area or \"party\" of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Montaña, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Higüey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual. [ citation needed ] \\n\nDon Pedro Tomás de Córdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"anchorage of the ships that travel from Europe to Havana and Mexico \". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\" [ citation needed ] \\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a village.  Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, Isabela , Lares , Moca , Rincón , and San Sebastián . In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Higüey, and Mangual barrios are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas barrio appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new barrios are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Higüey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo barrios. Malezas barrio appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its barrios, and following instructions of city authorities, Higüey and parts of Caimital Alto barrios are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla .

During this period, Aguadilla was home to the Strategic Air Command , equipped with RB-36s and 72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy equipped with B-52s , an important strategic facility during the Cold War .\\nActivated in June 1952 as a Strategic Air Command very long-range reconnaissance unit at Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico, but not operational until October 1952.

The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the Rafael Hernández International Airport . The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel. The Officer\\'s Club now hosts the Faro Conference Center, a 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m 2 ) meeting facility.

It was populated by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi , the place later to become known as San Antonio.\\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the 1918 San Fermín earthquake , the village was completely destroyed by a tsunami . The families suffered the struggles caused by this natural disaster due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey .\\n\nThe village\\'s infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go 9 miles (14 km) south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\\n\nIn September 1939, some 3,796 acres (15.4 km 2 ) covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as Ramey Air Force Base .\\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to Ramey Air Force Base . These expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other characteristics of a small town. The town also has a flag and an emblem. Roberto Román Acevedo designed the town flag and emblem.\\n\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the worst railroad accident in its history.  Train No. 3 was traveling from San Juan to Ponce carrying passengers to their hometowns for the island general elections being held that same day. It stopped at the Jiménez Station in Aguadilla for a routine engineer and boilerman exchange with Train No. 4, which was heading to San Juan. The engineer assigned to Train No. 3\\'s ride from Jiménez Station to Ponce was José Antonio Román, an experienced freight train engineer who had never worked on passenger trains.  When the train left the station at 2:00 am, it comprised 6 passenger cars with hundreds of passengers and two freight cars.\\n\nAt 2:20 a.m. the train started to descend a hill section in Aguadilla known as Cuesta Vieja (Old Hill) at, what some witnesses described as, excessive speed. When the train reached the leveling-off point at the bottom of the hill it derailed . The steam locomotive ran into a ditch, where it exploded, and one of the freight cars crashed into one of the passenger cars, killing many inside. Witnesses described the scene as horrendous, with some accounts stating that parents were throwing their children out the windows to save them from the wreckage.  Chief of Police Guillermo Arroyo stated that the locomotive (No. 72), the express car, and three second class passenger cars were completely destroyed. Oscar Valle, an Aguadilla correspondent to El Mundo newspaper, summarized the scene with: \"The locomotive suffered a terrible explosion as it derailed, and the impact was so strong that 3 passenger cars were converted into a fantastic mound of wreckage\".  In the end, 16 passengers lost their lives, including the engineer and the boilerman, and 50 were injured in the crash.  \\n\nHurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing large-scale damage and destruction to infrastructure.   In Aguadilla 10 inches of rain were recorded and its more than 54,000 residents were left with no electrical power.  \\n\nThe four radar systems used by the Federal Aviation Administration for flights in and around Puerto Rico were damaged by Hurricane Maria , and it took nearly two weeks to fix them.
