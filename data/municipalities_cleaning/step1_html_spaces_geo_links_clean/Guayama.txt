    "main_content": "Contents\nGuayama, Puerto Rico\n\\n\nGuayama ( Spanish: [\\xc9 1wa'\\xca\\x9dama] , locally [wa'\\xca\\x9dama] ), officially the Autonomous Municipality of Guayama ( Spanish : Municipio Autónomo de Guayama ), is a city and municipality on the Caribbean coast of Puerto Rico . As of the 2020 U.S. Census , the city had a population of 36,614. It is the center of the Guayama metropolitan area with a population of 68,442 in 2020.\\n\nEtymology and nicknames\nThe original name of the city is San Antonio de Padua de Guayama , named after the saint Anthony of Padua ; as with other settlement names in Puerto Rico, the name was eventually shortened to Guayama . Guayama comes from the name of a Taíno cacique (chief), who was leader of the tribes in the southeastern coast of Puerto Rico. The Taíno word Guayama ( wayama ) is said to mean \"great place\" or \"big open space\".  Another legend tells that the name of the town comes from the name of a woman called Juana Guayama who is said to have been an early owner of the land around Guayama and granter of the land in modern-day Machete where the town was later founded.  \\n\nThe first nickname of the city was Ciudad del Guamaní (\"city of the Guamaní [River]\") after the river that crosses the municipality. The name of this river might be related to the name Guayama , and it has been important to the city since its early founding.  A more modern and more popular nickname for the city is Pueblo de los brujos (\"town of witches\" or \"town of warlocks\") or Pueblo brujo (\"witch town\"). This nickname traces its origins to a popular story that tells that residents of the city would bring a kind of leaf called hoja bruja (\"witch leaf\") to baseball games to \"scare\" the opposing team by pretending to cast spells on them. The town\\'s baseball team then adopted the hoja bruja as their symbol.  Another story tells that the nickname comes from a legendary baseball player from the city\\'s local team, Moncho El Brujo, who according to legend owed his success as a pitcher to witchcraft.  Regardless of the origin of the nickname, residents of Guayama are often called brujos and their basketball team now carries the name Brujos de Guayama (\"Guayama Warlocks\").  \\n\nHistory\nDuring the early years of the Spanish colonization , the region known today as Guayama was inhabited by Taíno native people. The indigenous population in this area decreased due to slavery and migration to the Lesser Antilles. The following centuries, the region was under attack from the Taíno rebellion , Caribs and pirates . The town was founded on January 29, 1736, as San Antonio de Padua de Guayama by then Spanish Governor Matías de Abadía , although there is knowledge of it being populated by native people as early as 1567. It was Governor Don Tomás de Abadía who officially declared Guayama a \"pueblo\" (town) with the name of San Antonio de Padua de Guayama . That same year the Catholic church in town, San Antonio de Padua , was declared a Parish. In 1776, Guayama had 200 houses, the church and a central plaza and the total population was approximately 5,000 villagers. Construction on Guayama\\'s Parroquial church of San Antonio de Padua began in 1827 and was completed 40 years later. In 1828 the construction of the King\\'s House (Casa del Rey) was completed and the church was rebuilt as well. Earlier that year, Guayama was hit by a terrible fire that destroyed 57 houses and 9 huts. Guayama territorial order was altered at different times through the years. Some of the most populated neighborhoods were segregated to form new towns. Patillas was established in 1811 as an independent municipality. In 1831, the territory comprised the neighborhoods: Algarrobos , Ancones , Arroyo , Carreras , Guayama Pueblo , Guamaní , Jobos , Machete , and Yaurel . Later, Arroyo was divided into Arroyo Este and Arroyo Oeste and neighborhoods emerged: Pozo Hondo, Palmas de Aguamanil, Caimital, Pitajayas, Cuatro Calles, Sabana Eneas, Palmas, and Salinas . The latter had been segregated from Coamo .\\n\nIn 1855, Arroyo was separated to become an independent municipality, taking the neighborhoods: Ancones, Arroyo, Yaurel, Pitajaya, and Cuatro Calles. By 1878, Guayama was a department head including: Comerío (then Sabana del Palmar), Cidra , Cayey , Salinas, Arroyo, San Lorenzo (then called Hato Grande), Aguas Buenas , Caguas , Gurabo , and Juncos . The development continued with the construction of the town cemetery in 1844, the slaughterhouse and meat market in 1851, and a wooden theater of two levels in 1878. By then Guayama had fourteen sugar plantations operating with steam engines and three with ox mills. Also practiced in this municipality was the exploitation of lead mines by the company \"La Estrella\", owned by Miguel Planellas, as well as the mineral galena, by the company \"La Rosita\", owned by Antonio Aponte. In 1881, Guayama is declared a Villa (First Order Municipality).\\n\nDuring the Spanish-American War , American forces under General Nelson A. Miles landed at Guánica near Ponce on July 25, 1898. The landing surprised the United States War Department no less than the Spanish, as Miles had been instructed to land near San Juan (the War Department learned of the landing through an Associated Press release.) However, en route to Puerto Rico Miles concluded that a San Juan landing was vulnerable to attack by small boats, and so changed plans. Ponce, said at the time to be the largest city in Puerto Rico, was connected with San Juan by a 110-kilometre (70 mi)  military road, well defended by the Spanish at Coamo and Aibonito. In order to flank this position, American Major General John R. Brooke landed at Arroyo, just east of Guayama, intending to move on Cayey , which is northwest of Guayama, along the road from Ponce to San Juan. General Brooke occupied Guayama August 5, 1898, after slight opposition, in the Battle of Guayama . On August 9, the Battle of Guamaní took place north of Guayama. A more significant battle, the Battle of Aibonito Pass , was halted on the morning of August 13 upon notification of the armistice between the United States and Spain.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Guayama was 12,749.  \\n\nAfter the Spanish-American War, Guayama continued to develop. The Bernardini Theater built by engineer Manuel Texidor y Alcalá del Olmo opened in 1913. The venue, property of attorney Thomas Bernardini, was the scene for artists of international fame. By that time, Guayama was considered one of the most important cities on the island\\'s social scene.\\n\nIn the early twentieth century, there were selected societies such as the \\'Coliseo Derkes\\' and \\'Grupo Primavera\\', which endowed performing arts as well as scientific events. By the mid-twentieth century, Guayama achieved great industrial development, especially with the establishment of Univis Optical Corp., Angela Manufacturing Company and a petrochemical complex of the Phillips Petroleum Company . In 1968, the company started production of paraffin, benzene, synthetic fibers, nylon, plastic anhydrous, a 3,800,000 litres (830,000 imp gal; 1,000,000 US gal) of gasoline a day, and many other products. During that same decade agriculture began to decline as a result of land loss , industrialization and the construction of multiple housing developments. The urban growth affected the sugar cane industry . However, in 1974, 155,595 tons of sugar cane was harvested in the Municipality producing 12,655 tons of refined sugar.  \\n\nIn November 2002, AES Puerto Rico opened its coal power plant in Guayama. The company transmits and distributes electricity through a 25-year contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority . The 2012 National Puerto Rican Day Parade was dedicated to the Municipality of Guayama and its people.\\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In Guayama, the hurricane triggered numerous landslides and caused major destruction with an estimated 2000 homes losing their roof. The river caused major flooding and people were left with no power.    After Hurricane Maria, the people of Guayama resorted to collecting spring water for their drinking water.  \\n\nGeography\nGuayama is located at 17°58\\xe2\\x80\\xb227\\xe2\\x80\\xb3N 66°06\\xe2\\x80\\xb236\\xe2\\x80\\xb3W ﻿ / ﻿ 17.974241°N 66.110034°W ﻿ / 17.974241; -66.110034 .   \\n\nThe Municipality of Guayama is located on the Southern Coastal Valley region, bordering the Caribbean Sea , south of Cayey ; east of Salinas ; and west of Patillas and Arroyo . Guayama\\'s municipal territory reaches the central mountain range to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. The mountain systems Sierra de Jájome (2,395 feet or 730 meters) and Sierra de Cayey cover some of the municipality area. The highest points are the Cerro de la Tabla (2,834 feet or 863 meters) and Cerro Tumbado (2,450 feet or 746 meters), which are part of the Sierra de Cayey mountain system.

The Guavate-Carite Forest, a 2,400-hectare (6,000-acre) nature reserve is inhabited by 50 species of birds, making this spot a recognized area for birding and has a reserve with a dwarf forest that was produced by the region\\'s high humidity and moist soil. The Aguirre Forest includes: mangroves , tidal flats , bird rookeries , research lakes & large manatee population. The Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve was established in 1987. The reserve is located between the coasts of Salinas and Guayama, approximately 1,167 hectares (2,883 acres) of mangrove forest and freshwater wetlands. The two main components: Mar Negro mangrove forest, which consists of a mangrove forest and a complex system of lagoons and channels interspersed with salt and mud flats; and Cayos Caribe Islets, which are surrounded by coral reefs and seagrass beds , with small beach deposits and upland areas.\\n\nThe annual precipitation is approximately 1,300 millimetres (52 in)  and the average temperature is 27 °C (81 °F).\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Guayama is subdivided into barrios .
