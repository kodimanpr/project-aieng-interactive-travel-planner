Lajas is spread over 11 barrios plus Lajas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Germán-Cabo Rojo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nLocated in the Lajas Valley , the town was founded in 1883 by the Xueta Teodoro Jácome Pagán . Xuetes ( Chuetas ) were Majorcan Jews ( Sephardic Catalan Jews). Some families changed their names from Jácome to the Castilian form Santiago . Jácome is the Mallorquin form of James (Ia\\'akov). Catalan Jews from Majorca were part of the early settlers in the south of Borikén (Puerto Rico).\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a colony of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Lajas was 8,789.  \\n\nThe village of La Parguera is a popular tourist destination to see the famous Bahía Fosforescente (Phosphorescent Bay) and its numerous keys and islets.  Parador La Parguera was founded by Puerto Rican comedian Henry LaFont (Julio Pancorbo Ortiz).  \\n\nPeople from the El Combate community in barrio Boquerón are known as mata con hacha (\"those who kill with axes\") based on folklore about a fight over the salinas , where those from Cabo Rojo fought with axes against people from the adjacent town of Lajas. Because the people from Lajas apparently fought back by throwing stones they are known as tira piedras (\"those who throw stones\").  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In Lajas, over 270 residences lost their roofs. The hurricane destroyed Lajas\\' pineapple industry.  \\n\nGeography\nLajas is located on the southern coast. Laguna Cartagena National Wildlife Refuge is a national protected area located in Lajas.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Lajas is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .       \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Lajas: El Papayo, El Tendal, Sector Sabana Yeguas, La Haya, Las Cuevas, Los Jovillos, Maguayo, Piñalejos, and Tokio.   \\n\n\\nLajas features a tropical savanna climate ( Aw/As ), common for southwestern Puerto Rico. The record high for the town is 103 °F (39 °C).\nDemographics\nTourism\nLajas is famous for its main touristic attraction, Bahía Fosforescente (La Parguera), a place where bioluminescent dinoflagellates of different colors appear when the water moves. The origin of the colored lights is the object of many legends. Lajas is also a fishing town.\\n\nThere are 5 beaches in Lajas.  \\nSome of the main attractions of Lajas are:\\n\nCulture\nLajas celebrates its patron saint festival in February. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   The festival has featured live performances by well-known artists such as Tito Rojas , and Arcángel .  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Lajas include:\\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Lajas is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Jayson Martínez, from the New Progressive Party (PNP). Martínez was elected at the 2020 general election .\\n\nThe city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two Senators. In 2012, Ramón Ruiz and Martín Vargas Morales , from the Popular Democratic Party , were elected as District Senators.  \\n\nTransportation\nThere are 5 bridges in Lajas.  \\n\nNotable people\nSymbols\nLajas municipio or Municipality has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag consists of three horizontal stripes; the top one is green, the center one is white and the bottom one is light yellow. A vertical white stripe down the left makes a white cross. In the center of the cross is a ripe yellow pineapple. The cross is surrounded by eleven gold stars; five in the top  part and six in the lower part of the cross, in the form of a circle.  \\n\nIt is gold with a green band crossing it diagonally right to left; gold stands for the wealth of the land and green for the beauty of the valley, which is a gift from mother nature to Lajas. The band is adorned, at each end, with a pineapple bordered in gold and black. In the center of the band, also in gold, a marine shell. In the top left there is a red cardinal\\'s hat and in the bottom a red anchor with green; the shield has a 3 tower castle, each one with two windows and a door. On the bottom, outside the shield, a banner with the inscription \"Ciudad Cardenalicia\" (Cardinal City). This, for Cardinal Luis Aponte Martínez, born in Lajas, who was the first and only Cardinal of the Catholic Church from Puerto Rico. The banner and the inscription appear in black.  \\n\nGallery\nScenes around Lajas:\\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links",
