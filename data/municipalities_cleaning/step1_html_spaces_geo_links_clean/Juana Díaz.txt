Juana Díaz is spread over 13 barrios and Juana Diaz Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the Ponce Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nJuana Díaz is known as \"La Ciudad del Maví\" (Maví City). Mabi is a fermented Taíno beverage made out from the bark of the mavi tree Colubrina elliptica .\\n\nHistory\nJuana Díaz was founded in 1798 and was known as Ciudad de Jacagua , in honor of the Taíno Cacique Jacaguax.  The civil government of this territory was established on April 25, 1798.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In August of 1898, Stephen Crane , a war correspondent for Hearst\\'s New York Journal , single-handedly took possession of the town before an American regiment arrived. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Juana Díaz was 27,896.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Juana Díaz, 2,500 homes lost their roof.  \\n\nGeography\nJuana Díaz is located on the southern coast. Several rivers run through the Juana Díaz territory, among them, Río Inabón and the Río Jacaguas , from which Juana Díaz takes it\\'s nickname, \"Ciudad del Jacaguas\". The Guayabal dam between Juana Díaz and Villalba is located in this river. Among its main tributaries are Río Toa Vaca in Villalba, also dammed. Both Guayabal and Toa Vaca lakes are visible in the map. Lake Toa Vaca is also the main source of drinking water for Juana Díaz, Ponce and other towns.  The highest point in the municipality is located close to the top of Cerro Maravilla .\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Juana Díaz is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  \\nand subbarrios,    are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Juana Díaz: Arús (Pastillito), Callejón de los Perros (Los Buenos), Sector San Carlos in Collores, Sector Baldío in Cuevas, La Atómica, Las Palmas and Manzanilla.   \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Juana Díaz page lists Casa Museo de los Santos Reyes , Salto de Collores , and Casa de la historia Juanadina José Rafael Gilot , as places of interest.  \\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , there are 30 beaches in Juana Díaz.  \\n\nEconomy\nIn the past, Juana Díaz was a large producer of sugarcane but with industrial development the sugar cane industry disappeared. Local rums are now produced from raw materials imported from other countries. Juana Díaz produces plantains, bananas, mangoes, and other crops that are consumed in the local markets and also exported to other countries. Cattle and pigs are also raised in local farms.\\n\nJuana Díaz is a producer of beige marble , one of the finest marbles in the world.\\n\nCulture\nJuana Díaz celebrates its patron saint festival in late August / early September. The Fiestas Patronales de San Ramón Nonato is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.   \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Juana Díaz include:\\n\nGovernment\nLike all municipalities in Puerto Rico , Juana Díaz is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Ramón Hernández Torres , from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Hernández was elected at the 2000 general election .\\n\nPart of the city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district V , which is represented by two senators. In 2012, Ramón Ruiz and Martín Vargas Morales , from the Popular Democratic Party , were elected as district senators.  The other part of the city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VI , which has been represented by Miguel Pereira Castillo and Angel M. Rodríguez since 2012.  \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag of Juana Díaz is rectangular in shape, formed by two triangles whose hypotenuse extends from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. The upper triangle is white, the symbol of silver and the lower triangle is yellow or gold. At its center is the coat of arms of Juana Díaz in its natural colors.   \\n\nThe coat of arms features The Nazarene Cross. It is in the center of the coat of arms. It stands out subtly between furrows and space, symbolizing the union of two races by means of the inalienable bond of the Christian faith. The cross also symbolizes the western Christian culture.  \\n\nThe woman represents - Mrs. Juana Díaz, the towns namesake - with her hands the woman strews thirteen grains of corn into thirteen furrows, symbolizing the seeds that germinated and were the base for the foundation and growth of our town. The woman dresses as those of her time.   \\n\nThe sun symbolizes a new horizon, hope in the formation of a town. The sun within the coat of arms has thirteen rays, each represents one of the barrios of Juana Díaz.   \\n\nThirteen knolls stand out in the coat of arms symbolizing each of the thirteen barrios or barrios of Juana Díaz. The mountains also symbolize that Juana Díaz has been one of the richest mineral towns in Puerto Rico.   \\n\nThe Indians represents the natives who settled the village before the arrival of the white man. The native carries on his back thirteen sheathed arrows and a bow, and an arrow on his head. The bow and arrow represent the only effective means of defense useful for survival.   \\n\nThe shackle and the whip represent Juana Díaz as the martyr of 1887 because the most heinous, repressive institution known at the time was enforced in our town, \"El Componte\". It was in Juana Díaz where liberal politicians and dedicated patriots were martyred because they fought against the tyranny imposed by Spanish General Romualdo Palacios . Palacios was the most tyrannical and cruel of all the governors of our nation. \"El Componte\", a military tribunal, was used to quiet the rebel voices of those who loved law and order.   \\n\nThe harp represents the music, the quill pen dipped in the ink well represents the verse, the poetry. Juana Díaz has generously given distinguished poets to Puerto Rican literature.   \\n\nCiudad del Jacaguas is the name by which Juana Díaz was known in the past. Many people knew Juana Díaz as the city of Jacaguas, but Luis Lloréns Torres dubbed it \"La Versalles de Ponce\" (Ponce\\'s Versailles).   \\n\nFour Castles Represent that Juana Díaz reached the stature of city. Cities have five castles in their coat of arms, villages have four and smaller towns have three.   \\n\nTransportation\nAmong the most important roads in Juana Díaz are the Luis A. Ferré Expressway ( PR-52 ) which connects Juana Díaz to Ponce and the airport in just minutes and San Juan in a little more than one hour. Other important roads include road PR-14 which runs through downtown Juana Díaz on its route between Ponce and Cayey , road PR-149 from Juana Díaz to Manatí running through Villalba and the \" Cordillera Central \" and road PR-1 which goes from Ponce to San Juan through the community of Pastillo in the south coast of Juana Díaz.\\n\nThere are 51 bridges in Juana Díaz.  \\n\nNotable people\nNatives of the Juana Diaz are referred to as \"Juanadinos\" within Puerto Rico. Among the most notable Juanadinos are:\\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links",
