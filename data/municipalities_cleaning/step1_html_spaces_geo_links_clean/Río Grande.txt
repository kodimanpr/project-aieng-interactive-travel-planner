Río Grande is spread over eight barrios and Río Grande Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . A big portion of El Yunque National Forest , including El Yunque \\'s peak, is located within the municipality.\\n\nHistory\nRío Grande was founded on July 16, 1840, by Desiderio and Quilimaco Escobar, with the approval of Governor Miguel López. It was named after the Río Grande and is located where the Río Grande and the Río Espíritu Santo join.\\n\nIn 1894, there were two sugar cane haciendas and 256 estancias growing minor fruits.  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Río Grande with the significant amount of rainfall.   Infrastructure was destroyed, trees were ripped out of the ground, and rivers were breached causing property losses to approximately 5000 people. Of the Puerto Rican amazon , 230 in captivity did survive.  \\n\nGeography\nRío Grande is on the northeastern coast of the island north of the Sierra de Luquillo .  A large portion of El Yunque National Forest and some of the highest points of the Sierra de Luquillo are located within Río Grande including El Yunque and El Toro , which at 3,474 feet (1,070 m) is the highest point in eastern Puerto Rico.\\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Río Grande is subdivided into barrios (which mean barrios or boroughs or neighborhoods in Spanish). The municipal buildings, central square and a large Catholic church are located in a small, central barrio called barrio-pueblo or simply Pueblo .    \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.       \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Río Grande: Sector Montebello and Sector El Hoyo in Malpica, Las Dolores, La Ponderosa, Villa Realidad, Estancias del Sol, and Hong Kong.   \\n\nDemographics\nIn 1894, while a Spanish colony , the population of Río Grande was 6,237.  Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Río Grande was 12,365.\\n\nTourism\nRío Grande is home to one of the largest secluded areas with beach access (Coco Beach) on the entire island. Major hotels in the area include Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Resort and Hyatt Regency Grand Reserve.
