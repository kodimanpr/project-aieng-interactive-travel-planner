Morovis is spread over 13 barrios and Morovis Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city).  It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nIn 1815, a group of residents, under the leadership of Don Juan José de la Torre, began the process to separate Morovis from Manatí . In 1817, the government of Puerto Rico approved the separation, but it was not until 1818 that the requirements of a population of one thousand residents and the construction of a church and several other public buildings was fulfilled, that the municipality of Morovis was officially founded. In 1822, the mayorship was constructed and in 1823, the new church was built, dedicated to Nuestra Señora del Carmen on lands donated by Don Juan Evangelista Rivera. Its first mayor was Don Juan José de la Torre, with its second mayor being Don Juan Evangelista Rivera.  \\nMorovis has a particular nickname. It was the only municipality in Puerto Rico that did not suffer from a cholera epidemic in 1853; as a result, a common phrase, \"la isla menos Morovis\" (\" (all of) the island but Morovis \") was coined. The phrase is believed by Puerto Ricans from outside of the town to have a negative connotation against moroveños , while, in reality, it is considered a positive motto.\\n\nIn 1875, Abino Casellas was mayor of Morovis and in 1879, Cruz Maria Castro was mayor.  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Morovis was 11,309.  \\n\nMorovis is a mountainous municipality with an area of approximately 100.3 square kilometres (38.7 sq mi), located slightly north of the center of the island,  which was hit particularly hard by Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017. With a 2016 estimate of 31,603 residents at the time, 1500 to 2000 homes lost their roof and 500 wooden homes were completed destroyed. Roads and bridges were impacted by landslides and flooding, and residents were left without access to electrical power, telecommunication services and basic necessities for many months.  \\n\nThe community in San Lorenzo , a barrio of Morovis with about 1,000 people, was left isolated when the bridge into the barrio was washed away by the Morovis River .    \\n\nThen mayor of Morovis, Carmen Maldonado delivered food to residents, the municipal town hall became a food distribution center and she arranged for the purchase and delivery of a water truck to provide clean water daily to the residents who did not have access to clean water.    \\n\nMaldonado spoke to New York governor Andrew Cuomo , requesting his help and Cuomo responded by contacting H.e.a.r.t. 9/11 , a non-profit organization. In early 2019, Maldonado received and thanked volunteers from H.e.a.r.t. 9/11 , mostly carpenters who came to Morovis to repair and rebuild homes damaged by the hurricane.  In late 2019, H.e.a.r.t. 9/11 was still rebuilding roofs in Morovis.   \\n\nGeography\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Morovis is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located near the center of the municipality, in a small barrio referred to as \"Pueblo\" .    \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.     \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following entire barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Morovis: Barrio Vaga, Santo Domingo-Pellejas, Ensanche, Parcelas Cuchillas, Comunidad José Otero Claverol, Parcelas San Lorenzo, Parcelas Torrecillas, Patrón, Sector Invasiones de Torrecillas, Sector Jobos, Sector Riachuelo, Sector Rosado, Barrio Unibón, Sector Vietnam , and Villa Roca .  \\n\nMorovis National (Veterans) Cemetery\nThe Morovis National Cemetery , a US veterans cemetery, was built in Morovis within a 247.5-acre parcel of land that can be accessed from Highway 137 at Km. 11.2 . It was built to replace the existing Puerto Rico National Cemetery located in Bayamón which reached capacity.   Construction was underway in 2019   with interments slated to begin in 2021.  \\n\nEconomy\nAn Energy Consortium was signed in late February, 2019 by the mayors of Villalba , Orocovis , Morovis, Ciales and Barranquitas municipalities. The consortium is the first of its kind for Puerto Rico. It is intended to have those municipalities work together to safeguard and create resilient, and efficient energy networks, with backups for their communities. This is part of the hurricane preparedness plan of these municipalities, which were hit particularly hard by Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017.  \\n\nTourism\nA well-known landmark in Morovis is The Red Bridge ( Puente Colorao ). It\\'s an iron bridge which was built in 1912 and is located on PR-155 in barrio Morovis Norte .\\n Cuevas Las Cabachuelas (Cabachuelas Caves) is a cave system in Puerto Rico which opened for tourism in 2019. It is located between the municipalities of Morovis and Ciales, Puerto Rico  in the Cabachuelas Natural Reserve, established in 2012  and is of cultural, archaeological, hydrological and geomorphological importance to Puerto Rico.  Guided tours are offered by the Diógenes Colón Gómez Cultural Center in Morovis, by reservation only.   \\n\nLa Patria Bakery, home of the Pan de La Patita Echa\\' , is a bakery established in 1862 in Morovis, that uses a brick oven for making bread. The bread has a curious name and look, resembling crossed legs.   \\n\nThe Julia M. Cheverez Electronic Library is located in the main square in Morovis barrio-pueblo also referred to as the pueblo .  \\n\nEach barrio had a mural painted by a group of local artists and ValorArte and the mural images depict values such as honor, peace, responsibility, leadership and culture.    \\n\nCasa Bavaria restaurant located in the central mountain range ( Cordillera Central ) in Morovis, has become a gathering place for Puerto Rico\\'s German community and was visited in 2009 by President Bill Clinton .   \\n\nCulture\nMorovis celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The Fiestas Patronales de Nuestra Señora del Carmen in honor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.    \\n\nOther festivals and events include:\\n\nDemographics\nGovernment\nCarmen Maldonado González , has been the elected  mayor of Morovis since 2017 and managed the devastation in Morovis caused by Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017. The bridge collapse in Morovis\\' San Lorenzo barrio was one of the challenges faced by Maldonado.  Maldonado was reelected in 2020.  \\n\nTransportation\nThere are 15 bridges in Morovis.  Major routes that go through Morovis include PR-137 , PR-145 , PR-155 , PR-159 , and PR-160 .\\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nThe flag of Morovis is divided vertically in two equal parts. The immediate one to the mast is yellow and has the eagle of the coat of arms, in this case with the head facing left, toward the flagpole. The other half is divided in seven vertical stripes of equal width, four red ones alternated with three yellow ones.  \\n\nThe coat of arms of the Municipality of Morovis is formed by an eagle in the left partition, which symbolizes Saint John the Evangelist and sings in honor of the founder of the town, Don Juan Evangelista Rivera. The five cuatros observable in the right partition symbolize the fact that the town of Morovis is the main center of production of such typical Puerto Rican musical instruments. The shield in the center represents the Order of the Carmelite Nuns, and symbolizes as well the Our Lady of the Carmen, matron of the town. The left half is a field of yellow color (yellow for gold) in which resides a saber (black) eagle, beak and claws in red, its head enclosed with a halo.  \\n\nNotable moroveños\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links",
