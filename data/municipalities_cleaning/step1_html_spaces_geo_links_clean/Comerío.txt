Comerío is spread over 7 barrios and Comerío Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nComerío was founded on June 12, 1826. Originally named Sabana del Palmar , but later changed to Comerío .  \\n\nIn 1854, nearly 1000 acres (1000 cuerdas ) of land were being used for agriculture. In 1894, there was one sugar and two coffee plantations ( estates ) in Comerío.  In the early 20th century, Comerio residents, had a short but legendary territory war with residents of the city of Barranquitas .\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Comerío was 8,249.  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Comerío.   The flooded river went through the center of Comerío. A week later the hospital, trying to run via generator, was out of diesel but due to the landslides, travel and deliveries, into and out of Comerío was next to impossible.  Over 4,000 homes were affected, and of those 1,537 completely destroyed.  After the hurricane, the National Guard from Ohio were tasked with restoring water purification systems for the people of Comerío. Two months after the hurricane, the mayor of Comerío said no personnel had made it yet to attempt the restoration of electrical power to Comerío.  On October 9, another landslide happened blocking transit on PR-167.  On October 10, a group of doctors from New York announced they would travel to volunteer their services to Comerío and nearby mountain municipalities.  \\n\nGeography\nThe rivers located in Comerío are Río de la Plata and Río Hondo .  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Comerío is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Comerio: Barriada Cielito, Sector Villa Brava in Piñas Abajo, El 26 in Palomas Abajo, El Higüero in Palomas Abajo, El Verde in Naranjo, La Juncia in Río Hondo II, La Pietra Cedrito, Río Hondo, and Vuelta del Dos.   \\n\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Comerío page lists Las Pailas , Represa el Salto , and Media Luna , as places of interest.  \\n\nSome of the landmarks of Comerío include:  \\n\nEconomy\nCulture\nComerío celebrates its patron saint festival in August.
