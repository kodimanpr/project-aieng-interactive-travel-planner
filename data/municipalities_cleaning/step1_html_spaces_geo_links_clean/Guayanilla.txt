Guayanilla is spread over 16 barrios and Guayanilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the Yauco Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nHistory\nGuayanilla was founded by Puerto Rican criollos . The original name was Guadianilla in memory of a river and town of the same name in Spain . However, it was changed to Guayanilla to resemble a native word in the Taíno language. The name Guayanilla is derived from a combination of Guaynia and Santa Maria de Guadianilla .\\n\nThe first Europeans settled in this area in 1511. In 1756, Yauco was founded as a town . Then Guayanilla was a borough of Yauco. Due to the very fertile lands and access to the local port where most of the local commerce occurred, Guayanilla became an important agricultural center where sugarcane was cultivated. Guayanilla grew quickly and was established as a separate municipality on February 27, 1833 by Governor Miguel de la Torre .\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Guayanilla was 9,540.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico.  In Guayanilla, the hurricane triggered numerous landslides and caused major destruction with an estimated 600 homes losing their roof and 300 homes completely destroyed. Roads, crops and structures were destroyed by the winds and flooding.    \\n\nOn January 6, 2020 a 5.8 magnitude earthquake was felt in Guayanilla and several structures and cars were destroyed. A family of eight escaped a home that was destroyed by the earthquake.   \\n\nOn January 7, 2020 a 6.4 magnitude earthquake destroyed the Catholic church in Guayanilla Pueblo .  \\n\nGeography\nGuayanilla is located on the southern coast. The coastline forms the Guayanilla Bay , one of the best natural harbors in Puerto Rico, to the south, also. The nearest city is Ponce , which is 12 miles (19 km) to the east. The northern regions are bordered by mountains that reach 3,300 feet (1,000 m) at the Cordillera Central . In the central regions, the terrain descends where it does not exceed 1,410 feet (430 m). Finally in the coastal plain, the elevations do not exceed 951 feet (290 m). The Yauco , Guayanilla , and Macaná rivers all run through the municipality. The Yauco River briefly runs through the Boca borough, where its exit into the Caribbean Sea and accompanying marshlands are located.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Guayanilla is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" , near the center of the municipality.   \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Guayanilla: Magas Abajo, Villa del Carmen in Playa barrio, Piedras Blancas, Playita, and San Pedro.  \\n\nTourism\nTo stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I\\'m Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website. The Guayanilla page lists Paseo Tablado Guayacán , Charco Los Peces , and Península del Río , as places of interest.  \\n\nAccording to a news article by Primera Hora , there are 17 beaches in Guayanilla.  \\n\nEconomy\nThe main industries in Guayanilla are the manufacturing of petrochemicals and the production of electricity by thermoelectrical plants.
