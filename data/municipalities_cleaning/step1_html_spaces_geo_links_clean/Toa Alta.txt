The construction of the San Fernando Rey Church in the main town square began in 1752. It is popularly said that the name Toa Alta comes from the Taíno word for mother or fertility, Thoa . Most likely the word toa comes from the Taino word for valley or mountain ; the region is also known as Valle del Toa (Toa Valley). [ citation needed ] \\n\nOver the years, agriculture became an important economic force in the area. At the peak of the agricultural economy, the town was also known as the \"Granja de los Reyes Católicos\" (the Farm of the Catholic Monarchs). The town is also called Ciudad del Josco . The town is commonly known by its nickname La Cuna de los Poetas , or \"Cradle of Poets\", due to the numerous Spanish-language poets born there, such as Abelardo Díaz Alfaro and the musician Tomás \"Masso\" Rivera.  \\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Toa Alta.   Many homes and roads in Toa Alta were destroyed by the hurricane.  \\n\nIn mid 2018, the United States Army Corps of Engineers announced it would be undertaking a major flood control project of a river that often causes flooding in Toa Alta, Río de la Plata .  \\n\nGeography\nToa Alta is located on the Northern Coastal Plain in the Northern Karst zone.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Toa Alta is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions )  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Toa Alta: Comunidad Acerolas, Sector Cuba Libre, Sector La Prá, Villa del Río, Villa Josco, and Villa Juventud.   \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nEconomy\nCulture\nToa Alta celebrates its patron saint festival in May.
