Salinas is spread over 5 barrios and Salinas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city).\\n\nIt has long been a fishing spot for Puerto Ricans , known for its beaches, fish variety and the birthplace of the famous \" mojo isleño\".\\n\nAlthough Salinas doesn\\'t have any commercial airports, there is a military training area there, Camp Santiago , which is one of the training centers of the Puerto Rico National Guard . Army National Guard , Air National Guard , State Guard, U.S. Army ROTC , U.S. Army Reserve and the U.S. Army also conduct military training at Camp Santiago.\\n\nHistory\nSalinas was founded in 1840. On July 22, 1841, its first municipal council was established by Don Agustín Colón Pacheco as Mayor, Don Jose Maria Cadavedo as Sargent of Arms, Don Juan Colon as Captain of the Civil Guard and five hacendados which were Don Antonio Semidey, Don Antonio Morelli, Don Francisco Secola, Don Julio Delannoy and Don Jose Antonio Torres. In 1847 it was annexed to the municipality of Guayama until 1851 when it regained its status as a municipality.\\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Salinas was 5,731\\n\nIn the 21st century the availability of clean drinking water has become an issue for Puerto Rico and especially for Salinas which is located in a dry region of the island.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Salinas, 2800 homes were destroyed by the winds, flooded rivers, and ocean surge.  \\n\nDuring Hurricane Fiona on September 18, 2022, flood waters from 760 millimetres (30 in)  of rain caused the river to flood neighborhoods and destroy homes in Salinas.  \\n\nGeography\nSalinas is on the southern coast.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Salinas is subdivided into barrios .
