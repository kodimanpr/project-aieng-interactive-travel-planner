It is located in the eastern central region of the island to the west of the Caguas Valley, south of Canóvanas and Carolina ; southeast of Gurabo ; east of San Lorenzo ; and west of Las Piedras . Juncos is spread over 9 barrios and Juncos barrio-pueblo (the downtown area and administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area .\\n\nJuncos was founded on the request of Tomás Pizarro on August 2, 1797, having previously been a village which evolved from a small ranch, the Hatillo de los Juncos . This ranch was part of the Hato del Valenciano , which gave its name to the Río Valenciano which bisects the city before joining the Río Gurabo to the north of the settlement.\\n\nJuncos is Spanish for reeds .\\n\nHistory\nDuring the 17th century, large parts of the municipality were owned by the Hato Grande de los Delgado (The Delgados\\' Great Ranch). Another ranch, the Hato del Valenciano , was established and later divided into the Hatillo de los Lirios and the Hatillo de los Juncos . This second one became the village of Juncos in the 18th century and was given the status of a town on August 2, 1797. Reeds, which gave the city its name, feature in the center of its flag and the bottom of its coat of arms. The Hato del Valenciano is remembered in the name of the Río Valenciano , as well as the coat of arms of Valencia featuring in Juncos\\' coat of arms, in addition to the city\\'s two nicknames of La Ciudad del Valenciano (The Valenciano City) and Los Mulos del Valenciano (The Valenciano\\'s Mules ).  \\n\nPuerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States . In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Juncos was 8,429.  \\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. Juncos had been declared a disaster zone a week earlier when Hurricane Irma made landfall only to be hit again. Destruction to homes and infrastructure was estimated at $25 million.  Maria triggered numerous landslides in Juncos with its significant wind and rainfall.   \\n\nSymbols\nThe municipio has an official flag and coat of arms.  \\n\nOn the flag of Juncos, on a gold field, blue waving stripes cross horizontally in the lower half. These represent the Río Valenciano which bisects the city. Green reeds with red buds appear in a central point above the stripes, representing the city\\'s name ( Juncos is Spanish for reeds ).  \\n\nJuncos\\' coat of arms is divided into four-quarters, with the upper left and lower right containing vertical stripes gold (or yellow) and gules (red) in reference to the Spanish region of Valencia and to its denomination as \"Town of Valencia\". The upper right quarter is blue with twelve silver stars to represent the Virgin Mary , and also features a cross confirming the city as part of Christendom . The lower right is split vertically between an image of a tobacco plant to represent the city\\'s agriculture and a chimney to represent industrialization and sugar cane processing. Like the flag, a waving blue line representing the Río Valenciano crosses the shield horizontally.  \\n\nThe shield is topped with a civic crown  in the shape of a three-towered castle. Underneath the shield lie the red-budded green reeds which gave the city its name, which features alongside its year of foundation (1797) at the very bottom.   \\n\nGeography\nJuncos is in the central eastern part of the island.  \\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Juncos is subdivided into barrios . The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located near the center of the municipality, in a barrio referred to as \"el pueblo\" .     \\n\nBarrios (which are like minor civil divisions )  and subbarrios,  are further subdivided into smaller areas called sectores ( sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial , among others.    \\n\nComunidades Especiales de Puerto Rico (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion . A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Juncos: \\nFlores, Santana 1 in Ceiba Norte, Canta Gallo, El Caracol, La Cuesta in Sector El Mangó, La Hormiga, Lirios Dorados in Hoyo Hondo and Rosalía in Sector El Mangó.   \\n\nDemographics\nTourism\nCulture\nJuncos celebrates its patron saint festival in December. The Fiestas Patronales Inmaculada Concepcion de Maria is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.  \\n\nOther festivals and events celebrated in Juncos include:\\n\nEconomy\nIn the fertile plains of the Río Valenciano , coffee, fruits, sugar cane and tobacco are grown. The lower left quarter of the municipal coat of arms pay homage to tobacco cultivation and sugar cane processing.\\n\nApparel, electronic machinery and electrical equipment, scientific instruments, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries\\n\nAmgen, a biopharmaceutical company, has developed its largest manufacturing site in Juncos.
