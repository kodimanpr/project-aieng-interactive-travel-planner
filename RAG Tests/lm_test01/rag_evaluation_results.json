Camping is allowed in designated areas (depending on the size of the group) and there are also cabins available for rent. Additionally, the forest is known for its vista points and observation towers: Yokahu Tower and Mount Britton Tower.  \\n\nHiking is probably the most popular activity in El Yunque National Forest.

The project was unsuccessful. In 1960, Manuel Frías Morales presented a law that would permit the study to establish the municipality but it was also unsuccessful.\\n\nFinally, on June 14, 1971, the Senate of Puerto Rico and Governor Don Luis A.
